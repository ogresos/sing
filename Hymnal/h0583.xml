  <lyrics>
	<stanza type="verse" number="1">Go to Him "without the camp,"
His reproach to gladly bear.
Suffered He without the gate,
How can I in comfort share?</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">Go to Him "without the camp,"
Willing e'en to bear the cross;
He has trod the narrow way,
I will follow, suff'ring loss.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">Go to Him "without the camp,"
Dear ones, relatives forsake;
He the Father's will did mind,
In His passion I partake.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">Go to Him "without the camp,"
His companion I will be;
Never join religion's ranks
Or the world's society.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">Go to Him "without the camp,"
Though the path be lone and grim;
Let all human friends desert,
I am satisfied with Him.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">Go to Him "without the camp,"
There to walk with Him, how blest!
E'er to see His smiling face
Ever in His presence rest.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">Go to Him "without the camp,"
Till the dawning of the day;
Then I'll see Him and rejoice,
With Him in His kingdom stay.</stanza>
