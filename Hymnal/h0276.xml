    <stanza type="verse" number="1">What a blessed fact! What a tiding glad!
  In the Spirit we have been baptized;
Take this settled fact, nothing need we add,
  In the Spirit we have been baptized.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Take it! take it!
Take now this fact by living faith;
  Take it! take it!
  Take now this accomplished fact by faith.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">In the testament it is clearly told,
  In the Spirit we have been baptized;
It is so complete, we need only hold,
  In the Spirit we have been baptized.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Hold it! hold it!
  Hold now this fact by living faith;
  Hold it! hold it!
    Hold now this accomplished fact by faith.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Christ upon the Church hath His Spirit poured,
  In the Spirit we have been-baptized;
Share her portion now, share in full accord,
  In the Spirit we have been baptized.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Share it! share it!
  Share now this fact by living faith;
  Share it! share it!
    Share now this accomplished fact by faith.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">With the Body right, on the Body ground,
  Move and act on this accomplished fact;
Sins and doubts condemn, wait no more around,
  But by living faith now move and act.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Act now! act now!
Act on this fact by living faith;
Act now! act now!
  Act on this accomplished fact by faith.</stanza>
