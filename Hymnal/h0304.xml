    <stanza type="verse" number="1">How should the Lord keep back His sword from blood?
"The soul that sinneth it shall surely die:"
But ah, can Justice make His counsels good?
Can Law bring in the glory from on high?
Grace must provide a Lamb&amp;mdash;a Ransom find;
Redeem by One whom death no more may bind.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">"One poor wise man" hath cried, O God, to Thee;
His blood is counted precious in Thy sight.
He liveth, and His name shall ever be
Thy praise, Thy glory, Thy supreme delight.
By Jesus' blood&amp;mdash;that new and living way&amp;mdash;
God's priests shall now within the holiest stay.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">The blood of bulls and goats for ages failed
To purge the conscience, burdened sore with sins;
Thy precious blood, O Lamb of God, prevailed&amp;mdash;
Through Thee, sweet Peace her endless reign begins.
Thy blood hath made redemption e'en for me;
Complete I stand, O risen Christ, in Thee.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">The precious blood of Christ, it speaketh peace
To guilty sinners, groaning 'neath their load;
To captive spirits it proclaims release,
And Pharaoh's slaves become the "hosts of God."
His flesh is meat&amp;mdash;His blood is drink indeed;
He died, He rose, His people's cause to plead.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Oh, precious blood! poured freely forth for me,
My sins are sunk beneath thy crimson tide.
No more before th' Avenger's sword I flee!
Christ is the Refuge-City, where I hide.
My life's dark page, blood-sprinkled, gleameth white;
My name shines forth in heaven in words of light.</stanza>
