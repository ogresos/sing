    <stanza type="verse" number="1">The heavens God's glory declare,
And the sky His work proclaimeth;
Day unto day their speech pours forth
To farthest reaches of the earth.
God's attributes, eternal pow'r
By creation are thus made known;
Things human eyes can't realize
By things He created are shown.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">The living Creator of all
Did not leave Himself without witness,
With grace and harvest bounteous,
He fills our hearts with gladness.
Heav'n sends down rain, earth brings forth grain&amp;mdash;
As bestowed from God, living, true;
Ye clothed, sustained, enjoying grace,
Be mindful of Him who made you.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">The Lord of all heaven and earth,
Life and breath to all men giveth;
Their boundaries and seasons sets
That groping they might find Him yet.
God&amp;mdash;hidden, unseen mystery&amp;mdash;
Universal secret is He;
All men must learn, this truth discern,
Creation's true meaning to see.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Creation shows something of God,
But 'tis not full revelation.
His person, image, only can
Be properly expressed through man.
Christ Jesus, God's beloved Son,
Came to earth, a human became;
God's very nature, all God is,
He constantly, fully displayed.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Mysterious Christ, marvelous!
God is manifest among us.
God infinite, in eternity,
Yet man in time, finite to be;
O Christ, mysterious, God in flesh,
Wond'rous news&amp;mdash;God mingled with man!
As God yet man, He'd enter in,
Your blessed rich portion within.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">God's nature was hidden in Him;
He did manifest God's image.
In flesh He has redemption wrought;
As Spirit, oneness with me sought.
Oh, God-man Christ, incarnate Word,
Bled and died to sinners redeem,
Rose from the grave, as Spirit came
To fill you, your life to be.</stanza>
