    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Drawn to the Cross which Thou hast blest,
With healing gifts for souls distrest,
To find in Thee my Life, my Rest,
  Christ crucified, I come.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Stained with the sins which I have wrought
In word and deed and secret thought;
For pardon which Thy Blood hath bought,
  Christ crucified, I come.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Weary of selfishness and pride,
False pleasures gone, vain hopes denied,
Deep in Thy wounds my shame to hide,
  Christ crucified, I come.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Thou knowest all my griefs and fears,
Thy grace abused, my misspent years;
Yet now to Thee, for cleansing tears,
  Christ crucified, I come.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">I would not, if I could, conceal
The ills which only Thou canst heal;
So to the Cross, where sinners kneel,
  Christ crucified, I come.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Wash me, and take away each stain,
Let nothing of my sin remain;
For cleansing, though it be through pain,
  Christ crucified, I come.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">To share with Thee Thy life divine,
Thy very likeness to be mine,
Since Thou hast made my nature Thine,
  Christ crucified, I come.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">To be what Thou wouldst have me be,
Accepted, sanctified in Thee,
Through what Thy grace shall work in me,
  Christ crucified, I come.</stanza>
