	<stanza type="verse" number="1">In all thy work, O Lord, Thou didst
At Calv'ry's cross once come to rest;
Yet Thou art working still today,
But in another form expressed.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">Thy saving pow'r Thou still dost show;
Thou still dost speak, enlighten, guide;
Thou and the Spirit in one stream
Sweep many in Thy living tide.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">Through Him Thy power's not withheld;
Through Him Thy working does not cease;
Thou still dost comfort and command,
Encourage, strengthen, and release.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">Since Thou art with the Spirit one
His coming means that Thou hast come,
And His indwelling is Thine own,
Since Thou the Spirit hast become.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">He executes within my heart
All Thy desires and Thy demands,
As for the Father here on earth
Thou hast performed all His commands.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">By knowing Him we know Thyself;
Obeying Him we Thee obey;
Allowing Him ourselves to fill,
We're filled with Thee, O wondrous way!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">Thou art not far away in heav'n,
Leaving us here alone, apart;
But Thou art still on earth; how grand!
Thou livest right within my heart.</stanza>
