    <stanza type="verse" number="1">O Father, Thou art boundless love,
We praise Thee and adore Thee;
Such lessons of Thy grace we've learned,
We can but joy before Thee.
For sonship Thou predestined us,
Before the earth was founded;
In time Thy pow'r was manifest:
Thy grace toward us abounded.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Thine only Son from death Thou raised,
Firstborn in resurrection,
His work completed, we by faith
Can stand as Thine expression.
We've now become Thy many sons
With joy our hearts are ringing;
Thy Firstborn Son so much has done,
We sing with praise unceasing.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Not only is His God our God,
His Father is our Father;
Same flesh, same bones, with Him we're one
And naught we twain can sever.
He leads us back now, Thee to see, 
And sing in Thine assembly;
We're just like Him, we're one with Him,
Thy many sons in glory.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">What love we find! What grace divine!
Thy Son and sons joined ever;
This is our portion evermore,
Our Father's joy and pleasure!
Thy Son will come down from on high,
Today we're waiting for Him;
Oh, this is all our heart's desire:
To sound our joy before Him.</stanza>
