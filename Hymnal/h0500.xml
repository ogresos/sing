	<stanza type="verse" number="1">Oh, what a might! Oh, what a strength!
God wrought to raise Christ from the dead.
Far above all at His right hand,
O'er all to us He is the Head.
All this great pow'r is to the Church
That she o'er all her foes may tread.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">Oh, what a fact! Oh, what a bliss!
That I of Christ a member am.
With all the saints I blend as one
And share the life of the new man.
Joined to our great ascended Head,
We'll be the Church of His own plan.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">Oh, what a breadth! Oh, what a length!
The height, the depth unsearchable!
Christ the Lord is unlimited,
So vast, immense, immeas'rable.
All that He is and all He has
Is now our life unspeakable.</stanza>
	<stanza type="note" number="">(Repeat the last two lines of each stanza)</stanza>
