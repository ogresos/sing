  <lyrics>
	<stanza type="verse" number="1">The essence of the Kingdom is
A life that's under heaven's rule,
A life whose nature is divine
With Christ experienced in full.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">Such is this life: in spirit poor,
With heart repentant, mourning, meek,
Which is to others merciful
And purely God Himself doth seek;</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">As sons of God the peace to make,
For righteousness e'en suffering pain;
Reviled and hurt for Jesus' sake,
Exceeding joyfulness to gain;</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">As salt to kill corruption rife,
In darkness shining as the light,
In heart and action right and true,
In perfect love to claim no right.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">This life self-glory doth renounce
And ever for God's kingdom prays;
It trusts in God for every need
And seeks His kingdom first always.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">'Tis strict with self, with others kind,
And always dealing with the Lord;
It ever does the Father's will
And acts according to His word.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">To Satan it does not give ground,
Nor to the world, or self, or sin,
But seeks beneath the heaven's rule
God's full authority to win.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="8">'Tis such a life which subjugates
All things with pow'r to God's behest;
The time it hastens when the Lord
Will here His kingdom manifest.</stanza>
