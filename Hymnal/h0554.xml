	<stanza type="verse" number="1">I come to His presence afresh
  Ere the night has passed into morning;
And His face I see as it shines on me&amp;mdash;
  The Lord within is dawning.
And He speaks to me and reveals to me
  All His riches for me today;
And with sweet delight I partake of Him,
  My hunger has passed away.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">As Spirit He speaks thru the Word
  Till my heart in echo is singing,
And the fount of life with His grace and pow'r
  Within my soul is springing.
And He speaks to me and reveals to me
  All His riches for me today;
And I drink of Him for my every need,
  My thirsting has passed away.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">In tenderness He deals with me,
  While I stay with joy in His presence;
And He saturates and supplies my soul
  With all His precious essence.
And He speaks to me and reveals to me
  All His riches for me today;
And in every way I partake of Him,
  My problems all passed away.</stanza>
