    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Come, let us to the Lord our God
  With contrite heart return;
Our God is gracious, nor will leave
  The desolate to mourn.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">His voice commands the tempest forth,
  And stills the stormy wave;
And though His arm be strong to smite,
  'Tis also strong to save.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Long hath the night of sorrow reigned;
  The dawn shall bring us light;
God shall appear, and we shall rise
  With gladness in His sight.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Our heart, if God we seek to know,
  Shall know Him, and rejoice;
His coming like the morn shall be,
  Like morning songs His voice.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">As dew upon the tender herb,
  Diffusing fragrance round,
As showers that usher in the spring,
  And cheer the thirsty ground;</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">So shall His presence bless our souls,
  And shed a joyful light;
That hallowed morn shall chase away
  The sorrows of the night.</stanza>
