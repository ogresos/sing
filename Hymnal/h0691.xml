    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Hark! the voice of love and mercy
  Sounds aloud from Calvary;
See, it rends the rocks asunder,
  Shakes the earth, and veils the sky:
"It is finished!" "It is finished!"
  Hear the dying Savior cry.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">"It is finished!" Oh, what pleasure
  Do these charming words afford!
Heavenly blessings without measure
  Flow to us from Christ, the Lord:
"It is finished!" "It is finished!"
  Saints, the dying words record.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Finished all the types and shadows
  Of the ceremonial law!
Finished all that God had promised;
  Death and hell no more shall awe:
"It is finished!" "It is finished!"
  Saints, from hence your comfort draw.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Tune your harps anew, ye seraphs,
  Join to sing the pleasing theme;
All on earth and all in heaven
  Join to praise Immanuel's name:
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  Glory to the bleeding Lamb!</stanza>
