    <stanza type="verse" number="1">More about Jesus would I know,
More of His grace to others show;
More of His saving fulness see,
More of His love who died for me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">More, more about Jesus,
More, more about Jesus;
More of His saving fulness see,
  More of His love who died for me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">More about Jesus let me learn,
More of His holy will discern;
Spirit of God my teacher be,
Showing the things of Christ to me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">More about Jesus; in His Word,
Holding communion with my Lord;
Hearing His voice in every line,
Making each faithful saying mine.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">More about Jesus; on His throne,
Riches in glory all His own;
More of His kingdom's sure increase;
More of His coming, Prince of Peace.</stanza>
