    <stanza type="verse" number="1">We have seen the Lord is coming
For the church for whom He died;
We are in the age of ages,
When the Lord will take His Bride!</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">'Tis a glorious age, the age of the ages,
Now, in this age, Christ will come!
So prepare ye now the church for the marriage,
  Christ and the church will be one!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Praise God, in this age we're living,
Age of God's recovery.
We are in the local churches,
Where the Bride prepared may be.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Unreservedly we're giving
All, that He be satisfied;
For the life and for the building
Of His holy, chosen Bride.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">'Tis a glorious age, the age of the ages,
Now in this age Christ will come!
We're preparing now the church for the marriage,
  Christ and the church will be one!</stanza>
