    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Take, drink this cup, His blood,
Redemption of our God.
The peace which Christ has made,
Is in this cup displayed.
We fellowship now with the Son:
On Calvary the work was done:
The way is clear, now all can come!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Take, drink this cup, each one,
His death show till He come.
Eat, drink, display this feast:
God in the Lamb released!
Around the table, sup and dine;
We eat the bread and drink the wine.
All blessing in this cup we find.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">No blood of cow or goat
Could give us any hope.
Our sins would all remain
Still year by year the same.
A God-man, sinless, He must find
No other offering of His kind,
A spotless lamb for all mankind.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Come! Now enjoy His blood.
What access this to God!
Here wondrous cleansing power
Flows to us, hour by hour.
One sacrifice for all was made,
And peace our conscience does pervade.
Redemption's price is fully paid!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Redeemer! Savior! King!
Of Thy dear blood we sing,
For in it now we see
Thy mercy, boundless, free.
This cup, our portion blessed of God,
Is of the cov'nant in Thy blood&amp;mdash;
Dear, precious, precious, priceless blood!</stanza>
