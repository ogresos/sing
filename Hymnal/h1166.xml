    <stanza type="verse" number="1">God has set the land before us,
And the land we will possess.
God has finally found a people
Tired of the wilderness.
Down with every weight and sin;
Let's go up and enter in.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
  Hallelujah, Amen.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">God has cleared the way before us
Through the victory of His Son;
Raised the Victor's banner o'er us,
All the battles He has won.
All that's left for us to do
Is by faith to follow through.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">It's a land of hills and valleys,
Brooks of water flowing free;
Fountains rich with living water,
Streams that flow abundantly.
Brothers, joyfully we stand
In His promise, Christ the land.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">God has made the fruit to grow here,
Filled the land with produce sweet:
Olive oil and pomegranates,
Fig trees, honey, vines and wheat.
We need nothing else besides,
All we need the land provides.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">We have eaten unto fullness,
And with joy we bless the Lord,
For the good land He has given;
Faithful to His promised Word.
Here we find there is no lack&amp;mdash;
Never, never we'll go back!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">All we need to do is labor,
Working on the land each day;
Not expecting 'manna' blessing,
Working in a normal way.
God and man cooperating
While for harvest we are waiting.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Labor thus will bring the increase
Of the land with all its worth,
And the Lord will have the harvest,
When He comes to reap the earth.
To provide the Lord the way,
We must labor day by day.</stanza>
