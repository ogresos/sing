    <stanza type="verse" number="1">We love Thy coming, Lord!
We know not when 'twill be,
But turn from all distracting things
Thine own dear face to see.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">We serve the living God
And wait His Son to see;
For this we need faith, love, and hope,
Increasing constantly.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">In Thy dear presence, Lord,
We hope we all may be
A crown of glory and a joy
To those we then shall see.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">We love Thy coming, Lord;
The time is very nigh.
Our hearts unblameable must be
To greet Thee from on high.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">The Lord Himself shall come
With loud assembling word,
And all the saints in Christ shall be
Forever with the Lord.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">We're children of the day,
We're children of the light;
That day should never come to us
As does a thief at night.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Lord, wholly sanctify
And blameless let us be
In spirit, soul, and body too
For that blest day with Thee.</stanza>
