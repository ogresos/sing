  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">He faileth not, for He is God;
He faileth not, His grace how good!
He faileth not, His Word is clear;
If we have God, whom need we fear?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">The highest mount, He can make plain;
The wildest flood, He can restrain!
God of Impossibilities!
Poor puny man, now learn His ways.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">The axe did swim on Jordan's wave!
Our God the Red Sea's waters clave!
He stopped the sun! made long the day!
This is the God to whom we pray.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">He bars the sea with feeble sand!
The proud waves bow at His command!
If God is thine, what more your need?
Can He not work for you indeed?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Our God is love; your needs are known;
His promises He'll fully own.
Our gracious God bows down His ear
The feeblest, weakest cry to hear.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Our God is light, and never yet,
One promise did He e'er forget.
His promises in Christ the Son
Are fully pledged, Yea and Amen.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Our faithful God, faith cannot break,
Nor death, nor hell, His promise shake!
Who ask in faith, He'll not deny;
His Word is sure, He must reply.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">He faileth not, let all men hear;
He faileth not, His Word is clear.
He faileth not, His grace how good;
He faileth not, for He is God!</stanza>
