    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Crown Him with many crowns,
  The Lamb upon His throne;
Hark! how the heav'nly anthem drowns
  All music but its own!
  Awake, my soul, and sing
  Of Him who died for thee,
And hail Him as thy matchless King
  Through all eternity.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Crown Him the Virgin's Son,
  The God Incarnate born,
Whose arm those crimson trophies won
  Which now His brow adorn:
  Fruit of the mystic Tree,
  As of that Tree the Stem;
The Root whence flows Thy mercy free,
  The Babe of Bethlehem.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Crown Him the Lord of Love:
  Behold His hands and side;
Rich wounds yet visible above
  In beauty glorified:
  No angel in the sky
  Can fully bear that sight,
But downward bends his burning eye
  At mysteries so bright.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Crown Him the Lord of peace,
  Whose power a scepter sways
From pole to pole, that wars may cease,
  And all be prayer and praise.
  His reign shall know no end,
  And round His pierced feet
Fair flowers of glory now extend
  Their fragrance ever sweet.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Crown Him the Lord of years,
  The Potentate of time.
Creator of the rolling spheres,
  Ineffable sublime.
  All hail, Redeemer, hail!
  For Thou hast died for me;
Thy praise shall never, never fail
  Throughout eternity.</stanza>
