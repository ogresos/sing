  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">He has entered! He has entered!
  Every guest may now depart;
He has taken all the chamber
  Of my once divided heart.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">He has entered! He has entered!
  Vanish every doubt and sin;
He has taken full possession,
  He is Lord of all within.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Long at my poor heart He tarried,
  Knocking with His wounded hand;
Wide at last to Him I opened,
  Yielding all to His command.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">He has entered! He has entered!
  Every sorrow now must flee;
Where He reigns as King and Master,
  There no grief can ever be.</stanza>
