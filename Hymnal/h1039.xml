    <stanza type="verse" number="1">There's a Stranger at the door,
    Let Him in;
He has been there oft before,
    Let Him in;
Let Him in, ere He is gone,
Let Him in, the Holy One,
Jesus Christ, the Father's Son,
    Let Him in.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Open now to Him your heart,
    Let Him in;
If you wait He will depart,
    Let Him in;
Let Him in, He is your Friend,
He your soul will sure defend,
He will keep you to the end,
    Let Him in.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Hear you now His loving voice?
    Let Him in;
Now, oh, now make Him your choice,
    Let Him in;
He is standing at your door,
Joy to you He will restore,
And His name you will adore,
    Let Him in.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Now admit the heav'nly Guest,
    Let Him in;
He will make for you a feast,
    Let Him in;
He will speak your sins forgiv'n.
And when earth ties all are riv'n,
Comfort, rest, you will be giv'n,
    Let Him in.</stanza>
