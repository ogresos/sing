    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Our Bridegroom soon is coming
  To claim His holy Bride,
The ones whom He has wooed, won,
  And wholly sanctified.
O Lord, we would be ready
  And get our hearts in tune
For the wedding day that's coming
    Very soon.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Oh, the wedding day is coming,
  Is coming very soon,
When the Bride shall be prepared
  And shall marry her Bridegroom.
Oh, what love and consecration
  Should all our hearts attune
For that wedding day that's coming
    Very soon.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Oh, that fine linen garment
  Which on that day we'll wear
E'en now, Lord, work within us
  And stitch by stitch prepare.
For this we would redeem
  Every moment opportune
For the wedding day that's coming
    Very soon.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Lord, may Your portion in us
  Continually increase
That we may be invited
  Unto that wedding feast.
And keep us always watching&amp;mdash;
  At morning, night, or noon&amp;mdash;
For the wedding day that's coming
    Very soon.</stanza>
