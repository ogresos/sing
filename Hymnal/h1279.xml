    <stanza type="verse" number="1">What we are, we're His image;
We're created in His image,
To express the Christ, subdue the earth,
The purpose of our second birth,
We're His image, glorious!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">What we are, we're the called ones,
We've been called into the purpose.
No longer low in Adam's fall,
God's glory is our holy call.
We're the called ones, glorious!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">What we are, we're the joint-heirs;
We inherit full salvation.
We overcome and share His throne.
All things today we fully own.
We're the joint-heirs, glorious!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">What we are, we're Christ's partners:
We share the same anointing.
No longer we're just serving Him;
His riches we may all share in.
We're His partners, glorious!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">What we are, we're the brothers.
We are all the holy brothers.
The life of Christ we did obtain,
For holiness the gold we gain.
Holy brothers, glorious!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">What we are, we're the lampstand;
We're the shining forth of Jesus.
In this world's darkness, sin, and strife,
We're holding Christ, the light of life.
We're the lampstand, glorious.</stanza>
