	<stanza type="verse" number="1">We have seen Christ is reality:
But it's not sufficient just to see:
He in our experience must be
  Everything to us.
We in prayer behold Him face to face,
In the Word and meetings know His grace;
But in daily life, in every place,
  What is He to us?
  Hallelujah! By His light we see
  Oh, how real, how full our Lord will be
  If we'll only turn to Him at every time,
    in every day,
  Every thing, in every way and&amp;mdash;
  Be specific for reality!
  And be done with generality!
  If we'll just apply Him, we will see
    He's everything to us.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">Life is full of opportunities
Ordered by our Father's hand: we see
Everything's the best that it could be,
  So let's gain Christ!
Christ our content and reality
To shine out from us unceasingly:
He must have a way in you and me,
  He must have a way.
  Hallelujah! In the body we
  Bear the death of Christ continually:
  Thus His life comes forth for all to see as
    The outer man is broken down,
  The inner man is shining so that&amp;mdash;
  In these earthen vessels men can see
  There's the treasure of reality!
  Thus the gospel's glorious light will be
    Shining out from us.</stanza>
	<stanza type="chorus" number="">Not just doctrines and theology,
But the content of reality:
Christ as everything in you and me,
  He's everything to us!</stanza>
