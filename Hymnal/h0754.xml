    <stanza type="verse" number="1">To those who fear Jehovah's name
How sweet the word the prophet brings:
The Sun of Righteousness shall rise
  With healing in His wings.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">It is to those that fear His name
His healing power the Savior brings;
Oh, let us hide with contrite hearts
  Beneath His healing wings.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">He is the Sun of Righteousness;
And while to sin our being clings
We cannot know His healing touch
  Or rest beneath His wings.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">It is His wings that heal our pains
And soothe the serpent's poisoned stings;
Close to His bosom we must press
  To feel His healing wings.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Beneath those healing wings I rest,
While all my heart with rapture sings:
The Sun of Righteousness has risen
  With healing in His wings.</stanza>
