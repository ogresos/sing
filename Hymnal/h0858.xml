    <stanza type="verse" number="1">All praise to our redeeming Lord,
  Who joins us by His grace,
And bids us, each to each restored,
  Together seek His face,
  Together seek His face.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">He bids us build each other up;
  And, gathered into one,
To our high calling's glorious hope,
  We hand in hand go on,
  We hand in hand go on.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">The gift which He on one bestows,
  We all delight to prove;
The grace through every vessel flows,
  In purest streams of love,
  In purest streams of love.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">We all partake the joy of one;
  The common peace we feel;
A peace to worldly minds unknown,
  A joy unspeakable,
  A joy unspeakable.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">And if our fellowship below
  In Christ yet be so sweet,
What height of rapture shall we know,
  When round His throne we meet,
  When round His throne we meet!</stanza>
