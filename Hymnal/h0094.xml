    <stanza type="verse" number="1">O Christ, what burdens bow'd Thy head!
  Our load was laid on Thee;
Thou stoodest in the sinner's stead,
  Didst bear all ill for me.
A victim led; Thy blood was shed;
  Now there's no load for me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Death and the curse were in our cup,
  O Christ, 'twas full for Thee!
But Thou hast drained the last dark drop&amp;mdash;
  'Tis empty now for me.
That bitter cup&amp;mdash;love drank it up;
  Now blessings' draught for me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Jehovah lifted up His rod,
  O Christ, it fell on Thee!
Thou wast sore stricken of Thy God;
  There's not one stroke for me.
Thy tears, Thy blood, beneath it flowed;
  Thy bruising healeth me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">The tempest's awful voice was heard,
  O Christ, it broke on Thee!
Thy open bosom was my ward,
  It braved the storm for me.
Thy form was scarred, Thy visage marred;
  Now cloudless peace for me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Jehovah bade His sword awake,
  O Christ, it woke 'gainst Thee!
Thy blood the flaming blade must slake;
  Thy heart its sheath must be&amp;mdash;
All for my sake, my peace to make;
  Now sleeps that sword for me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">For me, Lord Jesus, Thou hast died,
  And I have died in Thee;
Thou'rt ris'n: my bands are all untied,
  And now Thou liv'st in me.
When purified, made white, and tried,
  Thy glory then for me!</stanza>
