    <stanza type="verse" number="1">We've become the Lord's dear brothers
Through His resurrection pow'r;
He desires many brothers
Sharing in His triumph hour!</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Jesus is our Elder Brother,
First-born of God's sons is He;
He came forth in resurrection,
From religion He is free!
As His church we come together;
Oldness, form, and self deny;
Just to meet with our Big Brother,
  Him alone to glorify!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">In our Brother's resurrection
Resurrected we must meet,
Never in our natural standing&amp;mdash;
This will make His joy complete!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Every day we must see Jesus
As we're eating of the Word;
Then we'll run to all the meetings
Burning, bubbling with the Lord!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">In the meetings we are feasting
On the food unlimited.
Jesus always satisfies us,
Feeding us the living bread!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">We would satisfy our Brother,
Even though our portion's small.
Every one must share his "new dish"
For the benefit of all!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Not for message or for speaker,
But to meet the Lord we're here;
Caring only for His presence,
We would see our Brother dear!</stanza>
