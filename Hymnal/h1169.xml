    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Our worship in reality
Is typified in Moses' law:
With Canaan's produce, rich and sweet,
All Israel came and worshipped God.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">'Tis thus that we must come today
To worship in reality:
When we bring Christ as produce sweet
God fully satisfied will be.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">The worship that God so desired
Was not with manna sent from heav'n,
But from their labor on the land
The people's gifts to God were giv'n.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Thus, what God so desires today.
Are not the miracles so grand,
But daily, normal life in Christ,
As worship, produce of the land.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">The manna came from God alone;
The produce, from man's work on Him.
So all our worship now must come
From mingling with the Lord within.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">As day by day we live in Christ,
And take Him as our everything,
The produce of the land comes forth
And worship true to God we'll bring.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">The manna, Lord, no more we'll seek,
But Christ in all we will apply;
Then we will have some produce sweet,
Thine own dear heart to satisfy.</stanza>
