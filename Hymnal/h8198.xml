    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Worldly people who beheld You
Saw a common Nazarene,
You were slighted and made light of
Till Your death at Calvary;
Brought to naught, from man's perspective,
Ended was Your history.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">But how diff'rent the reaction
In the heav'ns, at Your ascent;
Glorious God, for Your obedience,
Had all heav'nly hosts at hand
To receive You and extol You
As the universe's Head.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">God already has established
You as Christ, as Lord of all;
No one now in heav'n or Sheol
Can't Your special name recall,
Not a creature disobedient
Who will not before You fall.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">How can I be so familiar
With the scene so far on high?
God, as proof, has sent His Spirit,
Thus the facts to verify;
He's become my gift within me,
Christ's enthronement proved thereby.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Spirit in me, manifested,
Jesus' Christhood proof affords;
Since He's really God's anointed,
Then in me the Spirit's poured.
Fact eternal, fixed and constant,
That the Nazarene is Lord!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Jesus is the Lord! Forever,
Immutable reality!
I'm infused by God the Spirit;
What a gift, this fact, to me!
Now I can but praise and bless Him
For the Spirit's gift so free.</stanza>
