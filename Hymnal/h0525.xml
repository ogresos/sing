    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Jesus, Fountain of my days,
  Well-spring of my heart's delight,
Brightness of my morning rays,
  Solace of my hours of night;
When I see Thee, I arise
To the hope of cloudless skies.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Oh, how weary were the years
  Ere Thy form to me was known;
Oh, how gloomy were the fears
  When I seemed to be alone;
I despaired the storm to brave
Till Thy footprints touched the wave.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">But Thy presence on the deep
  Calmed the pulses of the sea,
And the waters sank to sleep
  In the rest of seeing Thee;
And my once rebellious will
Heard the mandate, Peace, be still!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Now Thy will and mine are one,
  Heart in heart, and hand in hand;
All the clouds have touched the sun,
  And the ships have reached the land;
For Thy love has said to me,
No more night! and No more sea!</stanza>
