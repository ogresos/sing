    <stanza type="verse" number="1">In His Christ to head up all things
  Is our God's economy;
Taking Christ as Head and Center,
  All is one in harmony.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Christ as Head will be the Center;
  God within will be the Light;
Christ enthroned, with God, His substance,
  Will fulfill His heart's delight.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Christ as life will be the content,
  Heading up all things in light;
All the saints will be the vessel,
  To express His glory bright.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Satan hath himself injected
  Into man all things to spoil,
Bringing darkness and corruption
  God's eternal plan to foil.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Christ has come, Himself imparting
  Into man as life to save,
That the pow'r of death and darkness
  May no more all things enslave.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Thru the Church which is His Body
  Christ as Head will sum up all;
All will fitly join together,
  All things either great or small.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Under Christ, by His full headship,
  All in union will subsist;
In the light the Church expresses
  All in oneness will exist.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">Owning Christ as Head and Center,
  All will be in harmony;
Thru the shining of His Body
  All will share His liberty.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="9">No more darkness and corruption,
  No more death and vanity;
All will be released from bondage
  Throughout all eternity.</stanza>
