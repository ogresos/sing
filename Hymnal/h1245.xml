    <stanza type="verse" number="1">When the brothers are in order,
And you sense Christ is their life,
Follow them and watch for Jesus,
Ending thus your thought and strife.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Follow brothers, follow sisters,
When you sense Christ is their life,
Follow brothers, follow sisters,
  Help prepare the Bride for Christ.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">When you follow, as you follow;
Take the blood, and call His name;
Much assurance He will give you,
And the enemy you'll shame.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">When they speak, as they are speaking,
Open wide your heart to them,
Thus the Word of God receiving,
Word of God, and not of men.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Now the Word of God is running,
Running fast, and running free.
This is how the Lord is moving,
In His own recovery.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">O be glad, rejoice, dear brothers,
For the coming wedding day.
Then the Bride will be made ready&amp;mdash;
Those who followed all the way.</stanza>
