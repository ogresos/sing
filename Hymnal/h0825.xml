    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Church of God, beloved and chosen,
  Church of Christ for whom He died,
Claim thy gifts and praise the Giver,
  Ye are washed and sanctified.
Sanctified by God the Father,
  And by Jesus Christ His Son,
And by God the Holy Spirit,
  Holy, Holy, Three in One.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">By His will He sanctifieth,
  By the Spirit's power within;
By the loving hand that chasteneth
  Fruits of righteousness to win;
By His truth and by His promise,
  By the Word, His gift unpriced,
By His own blood, and by union
  With the risen life of Christ.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Holiness by faith in Jesus,
  Not by effort of thine own,
Sin's dominion crushed and broken
  By the power of grace alone,
Christ, the holiness within thee,
  His own beauty on thy brow:
This shall be thy pilgrim brightness,
  This thy blessed portion now.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">He will sanctify thee wholly;
  Body, spirit, soul shall be
Blameless till thy Savior's coming
  In His glorious majesty!
He hath perfected forever
  Those whom He hath sanctified;
Spotless, glorious, and holy,
  Is the Church, His chosen Bride.</stanza>
