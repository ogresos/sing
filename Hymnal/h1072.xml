    <stanza type="verse" number="1">She only touched the hem of His garment
  As to His side she stole,
Amid the crowd that gathered around Him;
  And straightway she was whole.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Oh, touch the hem of His garment!
  And thou, too, shalt be free!
His saving power this very hour
    Shall give new life to thee!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">He's pow'rful, present, real and gracious;
  Thou too canst touch Him now!
Just come and touch while He is still passing,
  His power thou shalt know.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Just touch in faith and touch Him in spirit,
  And He will make thee whole;
And peace that passeth all understanding
  With joy will fill thy soul.</stanza>
