	<stanza type="verse" number="1">We have found the Christ who's all in all;
  He is everything to us;
O how blest upon His name to call,
  How divine, how glorious!</stanza>
	<stanza type="chorus" number="">It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
  Full of glory, full of glory;
It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
    And the half has never yet been told!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">We have found that Christ the Spirit is
  Who within our spirit dwells;
How available, how near He is,
  And His sweetness all excels.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">We have found the way to live by Christ&amp;mdash;
  Pray His Word and call His name!
This&amp;mdash;the eating, drinking&amp;mdash;has sufficed
  And its worth we now proclaim.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">We have found the local church, our home;
  We are home and home indeed!
Nevermore in Babylon we roam;
  In the church is all we need.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">We have found that meeting with the saints
  Is the greatest joy on earth;
'Tis by this our spirit never faints
  And our lives are filled with worth.</stanza>
