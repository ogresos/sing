  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Long has Satan fought, resisting
  Faithful sons of God,
So the fighting church should notice,
  Spread the message broad.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">God ordained us as His soldiers,
  Bearing sword and shield,
For His purpose fully willing
  On the battle field.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Hosts of darkness now are gathered,
  Conflict has begun,
So the fighting church must gather
  Those who'll fight, not run.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Are there rebels still in God's court
  Who still love this age?
If the church is not aggressive,
  Battle we'll not wage.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Who's afraid to fight the devil,
  Dare the enemy?
If the saints shrink from Christ's kingdom,
  Shameful they will be.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">"He not with Me is against Me,"
  There's no other choice.
Where's the fighting church, God-fearing?
  Fealty we must voice.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Lo, God's Conqu'ror still is conqu'ring;
  Rise, assume His might!
Fighting church, on Calv'ry's hillside
  He did win the fight!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Once He fully faced the devil,
  We must face him too,
Else the fighting church can only
  Other troops review.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">Christ is calling overcomers.
  Who would please the King?
Now the fighting church should put on
  Armor threatening.</stanza>
