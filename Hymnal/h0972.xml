  <lyrics>
	<stanza type="verse" number="1">Lo, the central thought of God
Is that He be one with man;
He to man is everything
That He might fulfill His plan.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">Earthen vessel man was made&amp;mdash;
Body, soul, and spirit too,
God as life that he may take
And with Him have oneness true.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">By the flow of life divine,
Man becomes a precious stone
Fit for building God's abode,
That His glory might be known.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">'Tis the city God hath built,
'Tis the dwelling God requires,
'Tis the new Jerusalem
Which fulfills His heart's desires.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">'Tis the building of the saints,
'Tis the blend of God and man,
Purposed by the Father's will
Long before the world began.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">In its center, as its pow'r,
Is the throne of Christ and God,
Whence doth flow the stream of life
As the Spirit's living flood.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">Christ, the tree of life, is there
In the flowing of the stream,
Yielding fruit of life divine
As the food of life supreme.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="8">God in Christ, the glorious light,
Thru the city brightly shines,
Scattering all the deathly night
With its light of life divine.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="9">God in man and man in God
Mutual dwelling thus possess;
God the content is to man,
And the man doth God express.</stanza>
