  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Jesus the kingdom has come into us,
Reigning and shining He's all glorious,
Christ as the seed is the King who has come,
Into our spirit His kingdom He's sown.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">O let Him grow, O let Him grow;
His kingdom life be all we know.
Jesus, the kingdom is sown into us;
  Jesus, the kingdom, O how glorious!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">We must repent for the kingdom's at hand;
All that we do, think, or feel, or have planned
Must be abandoned and changed in our mind;
Leave all the world and self-seeking behind.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">All of religion has missed it again,
Teaching for doctrines the concepts of men;
They vainly wait for the kingdom to be.
A dispensation they're hoping to see.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">But now the kingdom to us has been shown,
It is no less than our Jesus alone.
It is the Person of Christ in us all,
And it begins as a seed when we call.</stanza>
