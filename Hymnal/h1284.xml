    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Our eyes have seen the vision:
The goal is now in view,
Christ has defeated Satan,
And sin and death are through.
The way is cut and open,
The paths are all made straight;
We've heard the call: Come forward!
We've laid aside each weight.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Come forward! Come forward!
Our Christ is on the throne.
His ministry, so heavenly,
  Brings all&amp;mdash;brings all the fighters home.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Our eyes have seen the vision
Since Christ our conquering King
Has called us to the battle,
Which He did surely win.
The vict'ry He bequested
Two thousand years ago
To all the glorious fighters
Who'll forward with Him go.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Our eyes have seen the vision.
Our Captain leads us on.
To press into our spirit,
To share with Him the throne.
Lord, Thou hast giv'n Thy soldiers
The pow'r to wield the sword,
And made us glorious fighters
Through Spirit, church, and Word.</stanza>
