    <stanza type="verse" number="1">He lives, the great Redeemer lives,
What joy the blest assurance gives!
And now, before His Father, God,
Pleads the full merits of His blood.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Repeated crimes awake our fears,
And Justice armed with frowns appears;
But in the Savior's lovely face
Sweet Mercy smiles, and all is peace.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Hence, then, ye black, despairing thoughts;
Above our fears, above our faults,
His mighty intercessions rise,
And guilt recedes, and terror dies.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">In every dark, distressful hour,
When sin and Satan join their power,
Let this dear hope repel the dart,
That Jesus bears us on His heart.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Great Advocate, almighty Friend!
On Him our humble hopes depend;
Our cause can never, never fail,
For Jesus pleads, and must prevail.</stanza>
