	<stanza type="verse" number="1">It is God's intent and pleasure
  To have Christ revealed in me,
Nothing outward as religion,
  But His Christ within to be.</stanza>
	<stanza type="chorus" number="">It is God's intent and pleasure
  That His Christ be wrought in me;
Nothing outwardly performing,
    But His Christ my all to be.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">It is God's intent and pleasure
  That His Christ may live in me;
Nothing as an outward practice,
  But Christ working inwardly.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">It is God's intent and pleasure
  That His Christ be formed in me;
Not the outward forms to follow,
  But Christ growing inwardly.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">It is God's intent and pleasure
  That His Christ make home in me;
Not just outwardly to serve Him,
  But Christ dwelling inwardly.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">It is God's intent and pleasure
  That His Christ my hope may be;
It is not objective glory,
  But 'tis Christ subjectively.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">It is God's intent and pleasure
  That His Christ be all in me;
Nothing outwardly possessing,
  But His Christ eternally.</stanza>
