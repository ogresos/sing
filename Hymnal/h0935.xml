    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Around Thy grave, Lord Jesus,
  In spirit here we stand,
With hearts all full of praises,
  To keep Thy blest command:
Our souls by faith rejoicing,
  To trace Thy path of love,
Down through death's angry billows,
  Up to the throne above.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Lord Jesus! we remember
  The travail of Thy soul,
When through Thy love's deep pity,
  The waves did o'er Thee roll;
Baptized in death's dark waters,
  For us Thy blood was shed;
For us Thou, Lord of Glory,
  Wast numbered with the dead.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">O Lord! Thou now art risen,
  Thy travail all is o'er;
For sin Thou once hast suffered,
  Thou liv'st to die no more;
Sin, death and hell are vanquished
  By Thee, the Church's Head;
And lo! we share Thy triumphs,
  Thou first-born from the dead.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Unto Thy death baptized,
  We own with Thee we died;
With Thee, our Life, we're risen,
  And shall be glorified.
From sin, the world, and Satan,
  We're ransomed by Thy blood,
And here would walk as strangers,
  Alive with Thee to God.</stanza>
