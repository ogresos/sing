    <stanza type="verse" number="1">All my doubts I give to Jesus;
  I've His gracious promise heard:
I shall never be confounded,
  I am trusting in that word.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">I am trusting, fully trusting,
  Sweetly trusting in His word;
I am trusting, fully trusting,
    Sweetly trusting in His word.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">All my sins I lay on Jesus,
  He doth wash me in His blood,
He will keep me pure and holy,
  He will keep me close to God.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">All my fears I give to Jesus,
  Rests my weary soul on Him;
Though my way be hid in darkness,
  Never can His light grow dim.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">All my joys I give to Jesus,
  He is all I want of bliss;
He of all the worlds is Master;
  He has all I need in this.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">All I am I give to Jesus;
  All my body, all my soul;
All l have, and all I hope for,
  While eternal ages roll.</stanza>
