    <stanza type="verse" number="1">There were ninety and nine that safely lay
  In the shelter of the flock,
But one was out on the hills away,
  Far off in the cold and dark;
Away on the mountains wild and bare,
Away from the tender Shepherd's care.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">"Lord, Thou hast here Thy ninety and nine;
  Are they not enough for Thee?"
But the Shepherd made answer: "This of Mine
  Has wandered away from Me;
And although the road be rough and steep,
I go to the desert to find My sheep."</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">But none of the ransomed ever knew
  How deep were the waters crossed;
Nor how dark was the night which the Lord passed through
  Ere He found His sheep that was lost.
Out in the bleak desert He heard its cry&amp;mdash;
All bleeding and helpless, and ready to die.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">"Lord, whence are those blood-drops all the way
  That mark out the mountain's track?"
"They were shed for one who had gone astray
  Ere the Shepherd could bring him back."
"Lord, whence are Thy hands so rent and torn?"
"They're pierced tonight by many a thorn."</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">And all through the mountains, thunder-riven,
  And up from the rocky steep,
There arose a cry to the gate of heaven,
  "Rejoice! I have found My sheep!"
And the angels echoed around the throne,
"Rejoice, for the Lord brings back His own!"</stanza>
