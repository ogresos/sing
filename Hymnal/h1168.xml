    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Laboring on Jesus, the good land so real,
Plowing and planting and watering the field.
He yields the produce of reality,
God reaps a harvest of Jesus in me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">O Jesus! You're God's good land
For me to labor on!
I'll bit by bit possess You
Until the whole is won!
With Canaan is God's purpose,
The labor He will bless;
Lord Jesus, here I gain Yourself,
  Your Person to possess.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Laboring on Jesus! My heart has been set,
Labor's begun, and I have no regret,
For with my labor God's sending the rain,
And all my labor on Christ yields much gain.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Laboring on Jesus this practical way&amp;mdash;
Praying His Word in the spirit each day,
Foll'wing His living anointing within,
Built up with others, the church life to win.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Laboring on Jesus yields reality,
Meetings of fullness for all men to see;
There God and man are indeed satisfied,
And there God's presence cannot be denied.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Labor on Jesus to have Him increased!
Then seek God's dwelling and come to the feast!
There bring and offer your surplus to God,
There eat the riches, rejoice in the Lord!</stanza>
