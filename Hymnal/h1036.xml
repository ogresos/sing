    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Look to Jesus, weary one,
  Look and live! look and live!
Look at what the Lord has done,
    Look and live!
See Him lifted on the tree,
  Look and live! look and live!
Hear Him say, "Look unto Me!"
    Look and live!</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Look! the Lord is lifted high,
Look to Him, He's ever nigh;
Look and live! why will ye die?
    Look and live!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Though unworthy, vile, unclean,
  Look and live! look and live!
Look away from self and sin,
    Look and live!
Long by Satan's power enslaved,
  Look and live! look and live!
Look to Me, ye shall be saved,
    Look and live!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Though you've wandered far away,
  Look and live! look and live!
Harden not your heart today,
    Look and live!
'Tis thy Father calls thee home,
  Look and live! look and live!
Whosoever will may come,
    Look and live!</stanza>
