    <stanza type="verse" number="1">She only touched the hem of His garment
  As to His side she stole,
Amid the crowd that gathered around Him;
  And straightway she was whole.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Oh, touch the hem of His garment,
  And thou, too, shalt be free!
His healing pow'r this very hour
    Shall give new life to thee!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">She came in fear and trembling before Him,
  She knew her Lord had come,
She felt that from Him virtue had healed her,
  The mighty deed was done.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">He turned with "Daughter, be of good comfort,
  Thy faith hath made thee whole";
And peace that passeth all understanding
  With gladness filled her soul.</stanza>
