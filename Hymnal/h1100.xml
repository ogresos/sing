	<stanza type="verse" number="1">God shall rise, His foes be scattered,
  All that hate Him flee away.
As the wax before the fire,
  All the wicked He shall slay.
But the righteous shall rejoice
  With a loud, triumphant voice,
Singing praises, singing praises,
  Singing praises unto God!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">He is riding through the deserts,
  Bringing in His saints in need.
He's a Father to the orphans
  And a refuge tried indeed
In His holy habitation&amp;mdash;
  What a wonderful salvation!
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
  Hallelujah, Amen!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">Here the lone have found a family,
  Here the desolate a home;
Prisoners are brought from bondage
  To prosperity unknown.
For the flock&amp;mdash;what wondrous grace&amp;mdash;
  God prepared this dwelling place:
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
  Hallelujah, Amen!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">Now the Lord in mighty triumph
  Sends the news of victory;
We the "women" spread the tidings&amp;mdash;
  "Kings of armies flee, they flee!"
No more sweat and dreary toil;
  We at home divide the spoil!
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
  Hallelujah, Amen!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">Lo, on high Christ hath ascended,
  Leading captives in His train;
These as gifts He has perfected
  That the Lord may dwell with them.
Brothers, sisters, we are those,
  We're those transformed, vanquished foes!
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
  Hallelujah, Amen!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">Blessed be the Lord forever:
  Day by day He loads with good,
E'en the God of our salvation&amp;mdash;
  Spread His worthy praise abroad.
His the goings forth from death,
  Every foe He conquereth!
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
  Hallelujah, Amen!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">They have seen, O God, Thy goings
  In Thy holy dwelling place,
Thy triumphal, high processions
  Midst a mighty voice of praise.
See the singers go before,
  Praising, praising o'er and o'er:
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
  Hallelujah, Amen!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="8">Little Benjamin is leading,
  Then great Judah's company:
Son of sorrow at God's right hand,
  Lion with the scepter see.
Zebulun and Naphtali
  Make the joyful tidings fly:
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
  Hallelujah, Amen!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="9">Saints, thy strength has been commanded
  From the temple glorious;
Still we pray that God may strengthen
  All that He has wrought for us.
Higher yet our praise shall rise
  Till the utmost earth replies:
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
  Hallelujah, Amen!</stanza>
