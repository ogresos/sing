    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Who is He in yonder stall,
At whose feet the shepherds fall?</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">'Tis the Lord! oh wondrous story!
'Tis the Lord! the King of glory!
At His feet we humbly fall,
  Crown Him! crown Him, Lord of all!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Who is He in deep distress,
Fasting in the wilderness?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Who is He the people bless
For His words of gentleness?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Who is He to whom they bring
All the sick and sorrowing?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Who is He that stands and weeps
At the grave where Lazarus sleeps?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Who is He the gathering throng
Greet with loud triumphant song?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Lo! at midnight, who is He
Prays in dark Gethsemane?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">Who is He on yonder tree
Dies in grief and agony?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="9">Who is He who from the grave
Comes to succor, help, and save?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="10">Who is He who from His throne
Rules through all the worlds alone?</stanza>
