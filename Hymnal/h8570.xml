  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">While fighting for my Savior here,
  The devil tries me hard;
He uses all his mighty pow'r,
  My progress to retard;
He's up to ev'ry move,
And yet thro' all I prove
A little talk with Jesus
  Makes it right, all right.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">A little talk with Jesus
  Makes it right, all right,
A little talk with Jesus
  Makes it right, all right,
In trials of ev'ry kind,
  Praise God I always find,
A little talk with Jesus
  Makes it right, all right.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Tho' dark the night and clouds look black
  And stormy overhead,
And trials of almost ev'ry kind
  Across my path are spread;
How soon I conquer all,
As to the Lord I call,
A little talk with Jesus
  Makes it right, all right.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">When those who once were dearest friends
  Begin to persecute,
And more who once professed to love,
  Have silent grown and mute;
I tell Him all my grief,
He quickly sends relief,
A little talk with Jesus
  Makes it right, all right.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">And thus, by frequent little talks,
  I gain the victory;
And march along with cheerful song,
  Enjoying liberty;
With Jesus as my Friend,
I'll prove until the end,
A little talk with Jesus
  Makes it right, all right.</stanza>
