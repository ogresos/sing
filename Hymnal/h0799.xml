	<stanza type="verse" number="1">All Scripture is the very breath of God,
And by His Spirit into words was breathed;
By godly men the words were written down,
With all God's fulness unto man bequeathed.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">It is the breath of God as light to man,
With rays divine man to illuminate;
It shines in darkness and to man reveals
What is his truest need and actual state.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">It is the breath of God as life to man,
Nature divine to man it doth impart;
The dead it quickens and regenerates,
Transforms the soul-life and renews the heart.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">It is the breath of God as wisdom too,
Knowledge divine to man it has to teach;
Th' eternal purpose of the Lord it shows,
And leadeth man God's final goal to reach.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">It is the breath of God as strength to man,
Power divine to man it doth transmit,
Strength'ning the weak, empowering the faint,
Enabling man God's purpose full to fit.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">It is the breath of God for us to breathe,
That as our portion God we may enjoy;
Receiving it by spirits exercised,
Our need is met, His wealth we may employ.</stanza>
