    <stanza type="verse" number="1">In the Name of Jesus
  Every knee shall bow,
Every tongue confess Him
  King of glory now;
'Tis the Father's pleasure
  We should call Him Lord,
Who from the beginning
  Was the Mighty Word.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">At His voice creation
  Sprang at once to sight:
All the angel faces,
  All the hosts of light,
Thrones and dominations,
  Stars upon their way,
All the heav'nly orders,
  In their great array.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Humbled for a season,
  To receive a Name
From the lips of sinners
  Unto whom He came,
Faithfully He bore it
  Spotless to the last,
Brought it back victorious,
  When from death He passed;</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Bore it up triumphant,
  With its human light,
Through all ranks of creatures,
  To the central height;
To the throne of Godhead,
  To the Father's breast,
Filled it with the glory
  Of that perfect rest.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Name Him, brothers, name Him,
  With love strong as death,
But with awe and wonder,
  And with bated breath;
He is God the Savior,
  He is Christ the Lord,
Ever to be worshiped,
  Trusted, and adored.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">In your hearts enthrone Him;
  There let Him subdue
All that is not holy,
  All that is not true;
Crown Him as your Captain
  In temptation's hour;
Let His will enfold you
  In its light and power.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Brothers, this Lord Jesus
  Shall return again,
With His Father's glory,
  With His angel train;
For all wreaths of empire
  Meet upon His brow,
And our hearts confess Him
  King of glory now.</stanza>
