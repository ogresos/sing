    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Made free! Made free! O captive!
  Bound by the law of sin,
The law of life in Spirit
  Will quicken you within.
And counting on the Spirit,
  His life shall now control
The members of your body,
  The portals of your soul.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Made free! Made free in Jesus:
  For crucified with Him,
From center to circumf'rence,
  He breaks the power of sin.
No longer act in body
  As if it had no "law";
His "law of life" must govern
  All that ran wild before.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Made free! Made free in Jesus:
  Deep planted in His death,
He liberates His life pow'r,
  And breathes His Spirit's breath.
Then waxing strong in spirit,
  With force of quickening life;
The soul and body governed,
  Its members cease from strife!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Made free! Made free in Jesus:
  Joined to the Risen One,
By conflict prayer you triumph,
  And claim His victory won.
Freed with His glorious freedom,
  Above the darkness rife;
For now the law of sin and death
  Is conquered by His life.</stanza>
