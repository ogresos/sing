    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Thou sweet, beloved will of God,
  My anchor ground, my fortress hill,
My spirit's silent, fair abode,
  In Thee I hide me and am still.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">O Will, that willest good alone,
  Lead Thou the way, Thou guidest best;
A little child, I follow on,
  And, trusting, lean upon Thy breast.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">God's will doth make the bitter sweet,
  And all is well when it is done;
Unless His will doth hallow it,
  The glory of all joy is gone.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Thy beautiful sweet will, my God,
  Holds fast in its sublime embrace
My captive will, a gladsome bird,
  Prisoned in such a realm of grace.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Within this place of certain good
  Love evermore expands her wings,
Or nestling in Thy perfect choice,
  Abides content with what it brings.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Oh, lightest burden, sweetest yoke;
  It lifts, it bears my happy soul,
It giveth wings to this poor heart;
  My freedom is Thy grand control.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Upon God's will I lay me down,
  As child upon its mother's breast;
No silken couch, nor softest bed,
  Could ever give me such deep rest.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">Thy wonderful grand will, my God,
  With triumph now I make it mine;
And faith shall cry a joyous Yes
  To every dear command of Thine.</stanza>
