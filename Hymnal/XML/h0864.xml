	<stanza type="verse" number="1">Whene'er we meet with Christ endued,
  The surplus of His plenitude
We offer unto God as food,
  And thus exhibit Christ.</stanza>
	<stanza type="chorus" number="">Let us exhibit Christ,
  Let us exhibit Christ;
We'll bring His surplus to the church
    And thus exhibit Christ.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">In Christ we live, by Christ we fight,
  On Christ we labor day and night,
And with His surplus we unite
  To thus exhibit Christ.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">Our life and all we are and do
  Is Christ Himself, the substance true,
That every time we meet anew
  We may exhibit Christ.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">In meetings Christ to God we bear
  And Christ with one another share,
And Christ with God enjoying there,
  We thus exhibit Christ.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">The risen Christ to God we bring,
  And Christ ascended offering,
God's satisfaction answering,
  We thus exhibit Christ.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">The center and reality,
  The atmosphere and ministry,
Of all our meetings is that we
  May thus exhibit Christ.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">The testimony and the prayer,
  And all the fellowship we share,
The exercise of gifts, whate'er,
  Should just exhibit Christ.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="8">The Father we would glorify,
  Exalting Christ the Son, thereby
The meeting's purpose satisfy
  That we exhibit Christ.</stanza>
