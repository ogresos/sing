	<stanza type="verse" number="1">The overflow of life is work,
  The work should be our living!
What we experience e'er should be
  The message we are giving.
When living and the work are one,
  The work will be effectual;
When message and the life are one,
  The word will be successful.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">The work must be the fruit of life,
  Born thru the Spirit's flowing;
As branches of the Lord, the vine,
  Fruit bearing, life bestowing.
'Tis Christ Himself thru us to work,
  Himself as life expressing,
And all the riches of His life
  To others manifesting.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">'Tis not a movement borne of man,
  But by His power moving;
'Tis not the deeds done outwardly,
  But inward action proving.
'Tis not the work of enterprise,
  But 'tis His life confessing;
'Tis not to toil for our success,
  But 'tis Himself expressing.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">Our plans, our aims, our energy
  We must abandon wholly,
That He may work His plan thru us,
  His aim and object solely.
Ourselves, with all we are and have,
  To death we must surrender,
That Christ may live Himself thru us
  With riches and with splendor.</stanza>
