  <lyrics>
	<stanza type="verse" number="1">The holiest of God's temple is
The inmost part; the mercy seat,
God's presence and the ark are there,
And there the priests the Lord may meet.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">Now we're God's temple in three parts;
Our inmost part the spirit is;
There God and Christ as Spirit dwell,
The holiest place of holy 'tis.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">'Tis here within our inmost part
That God in Christ is all to us;
'Tis here the Holy Spirit makes
The Lord reality to us.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">'Tis here within the spirit-part
We contact Christ and dwell with Him;
'Tis by our spirit we with God
Have fellowship and worship Him.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">'Tis here that Christ is like the land
Where we may dwell, its wealth enjoy;
'Tis here that we must fight the foe,
And Christ's authority employ.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">The spirit we must seek to know,
Discerning spirit from the soul,
And live within this holiest place,
To worship God and reach His goal.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">The soul we ever must forsake,
Press on, God's rest to enter in,
That Christ we may possess in full
And all God's plan fulfill therein.</stanza>
