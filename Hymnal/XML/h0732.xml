    <stanza type="verse" number="1">My Father is rich in houses and lands,
He holdeth the wealth of the world in His hands!
Of rubies and diamonds, of silver and gold,
His coffers are full, He has riches untold.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">I'm a child of the King,
A child of the King:
With Jesus my Savior,
  I'm a child of the King.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">My Father's own Son, the Savior of men,
Once wandered on earth as the poorest of them.
But now He is pleading our pardon on high,
That we may be His when He comes by and by.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">I once was an out-cast stranger on earth,
A sinner by choice, and an alien by birth;
But I've been adopted, my name's written down,
An heir of salvation, the kingdom and crown.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Though poor on this earth, oh, why should I care?
Since glorious things for me God doth prepare;
Though trials abound, yet, still I may sing:
All glory to God, I'm a child of the King.</stanza>
