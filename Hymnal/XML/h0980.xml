    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Throughout the whole of Holy Writ
The saints in type are manifest
As like a bride, God's heart to please,
And as a building for His rest.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">The types and figures of the Church
In the Old Testament are these:
A building meet for life and rule,
A bride the man to match and please.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">God's people in the ancient times
Were called by God His very spouse;
Among them and with them were built
God's ruling city and God's house.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Incarnate God, the God-man, Christ,
As Bridegroom for the Bride has come;
With His own life He quickened her,
That she His counterpart become.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">In resurrection Christ doth now,
As David's Son, God's temple build,
That God may have a resting place
And there accomplish all He willed.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">The Church is thus the Bride of Christ,
In whom His full delight doth rest;
It is a dwelling place to God
Where He may live and be expressed.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">The new Jerusalem will be
The full perfection ultimate
Of all the types of house and bride,
Th' eternal plan to consummate.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">It is the Bride which matches Christ,
Thru whom He may Himself express;
It is God's tabernacle too
In which our God can rule and rest.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="9">The ultimate completion 'tis
Of God's work in humanity,
His full expression glorious
Thru His redeemed eternally.</stanza>
