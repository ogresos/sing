    <stanza type="verse" number="1">At even when the sun was set,
The sick, O Lord, around Thee lay;
O in what divers pains they met!
O with what joy they went away!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Once more 'tis eventide, and we
Oppressed with various ills draw near;
What if Thy form we cannot see?
We know and feel that Thou art here.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">O Savior Christ, our woes dispel;
For some are sick, and some are sad,
And some have never loved Thee well
And some have lost the love they had;</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">*And some have found the world is vain,
Yet from the world they break not free;
And some have friends who give them pain,
Yet have not sought a friend in Thee;</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">*And none, O Lord, have perfect rest,
For none are wholly free from sin;
And they who fain would serve Thee best
Are conscious most of wrong within.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">O Savior Christ, Thou too art Man;
Thou hast been troubled, tempted, tried;
Thy kind but searching glance can scan
The very wounds that shame would hide.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Thy touch has still its ancient power;
No word from Thee can fruitless fall;
Hear in this solemn evening hour,
And in Thy mercy heal us all.</stanza>
    <stanza type="note" number="">Vv. 4 and 5 may be omitted if hymn is sung for physical healing.</stanza>
