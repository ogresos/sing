    <stanza type="verse" number="1">I have a Friend so precious,
So very dear to me,
He loves me with a tender love,
He loves me faithfully;
I could not live apart from Him,
I love to feel Him nigh;
And so we dwell together,
My Lord and I.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Sometimes I'm faint and weary,
He knows that I am weak;
And as He bids me lean on Him,
His help I'll gladly seek;
He leads me in the path of light,
Beneath a sunny sky;
And so we dwell together,
My Lord and I.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">He knows how much I love Him,
He knows I love Him well;
But with what love He loveth me,
My tongue can never tell;
It is an everlasting love
In ever rich supply;
And so we dwell together,
My Lord and I.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">I tell Him all my sorrows,
I tell Him all my joys,
I tell Him all that pleases me,
I tell Him what annoys;
He tells me what I ought to do,
Hs tells me what to try;
And so we dwell together,
My Lord and I.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">He knows how I am longing
Some weary soul to win,
And so He bids me go and speak
A loving word for Him;
He bids me tell His wondrous love,
And why He came to die;
And so we dwell together,
My Lord and I.</stanza>
