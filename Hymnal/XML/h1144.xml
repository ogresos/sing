	<stanza type="verse" number="1">In the Word of old, we are clearly told,
  In His image God created man.
To express His worth, to subdue the earth,
  Have dominion and fulfill His plan.</stanza>
	<stanza type="chorus" number="">Image, image,
In His image He created man.
  Image, image,
For dominion, to fulfill His Plan.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">Yet no rules He gave, no instructions, save:
  "Every tree shall be to thee for meat."
But one tree, He said, surely makes you dead;
  Fruit of knowledge isn't good to eat.</stanza>
	<stanza type="chorus" number="">Knowledge, knowledge,
Fruit of knowledge wasn't meant for meat.
  Knowledge, knowledge,
Fruit of knowledge isn't good to eat.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">Midst the garden fair, see the life tree there&amp;mdash;
  God Himself the tree of life does show.
But the enemy, somehow subtly
  Tempted man the other tree to know.</stanza>
	<stanza type="chorus" number="">Fallen, fallen,
Man has eaten of the deadly tree.
  Fallen, fallen,
Man requires a full recovery.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">Then came Jesus Christ as the tree of life,
  Satisfying all that God required.
He redeemed the earth, giving man new birth,
  And became the food that man desired.</stanza>
	<stanza type="chorus" number="">Jesus, Jesus,
Jesus Christ is really good to eat.
  Jesus, Jesus,
He is real drink and real meat.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">Jesus ne'er designed e'er to feed our mind;
  All good knowledge only puffeth up.
But He came, He said, as a feast instead,
  Not to analyze, but only sup.</stanza>
	<stanza type="chorus" number="">Take Him, take Him,
Wholly satisfying, glorious.
  Take Him, take Him,
Jesus is the tree of life to us.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">As we eat the Lord, growth He does afford,
  Life and numbers soon will be increased.
We must clearly see God's recovery&amp;mdash;
  Christ is not religion, but a feast.</stanza>
	<stanza type="chorus" number="">Eat Him, eat Him,
Christ as life is all the food we need.
  Eat Him, eat Him,
He who eateth Him shall live indeed.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">Eating is the way to live Christ today,
  Of the eating there should be no lack.
As the churches eat, they become complete,
  Eating Christ will bring the Bridegroom back.</stanza>
	<stanza type="chorus" number="">Eating, eating,
Of our eating there must be no lack.
  Eating, eating,
Eating Christ will bring the Bridegroom back.</stanza>
