	<stanza type="verse" number="1">Holy priests are living stones
For God's building work today;
If these stones would builded be
All the priests must learn to pray.</stanza>
	<stanza type="chorus" number="">To the holiest often come,
In the spirit touch the throne,
Let the Lord flow thru in prayer,
  Thus the building work is done.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">All the saints must serve as priests,
That the living stones they be;
Each must priestly work perform,
Then their functions we will see.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">Tent and priests of olden times
Always did together go;
When the priests served in the tent,
Into one the two did flow.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">Now the building spiritual
And the priesthood all are one;
Now the building of the house
By the priestly work is done.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">In the priests the substance is
Of the building work replete;
When the priests their work discharge,
Then God's house will be complete.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">Building God and man in one
Is their work before the Lord;
In this fellowship divine
Saints are built in one accord.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">When in prayer our spirits blend,
Then together built are we,
Then a priesthood we become,
Off'ring sacrifice to Thee.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="8">Grant us grace, O Lord, that we
Treasure dear the priestly call;
In the spirit serve and pray,
That Thy church be built withal.</stanza>
