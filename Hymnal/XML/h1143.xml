	<stanza type="verse" number="1">The tree of life, how sweet the fruit,
  With God as life complete.
I once was dead, but now I live,
  Was starved, but now I eat.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">'Twas God that brought me to the tree,
  With Christ Himself as meat;
How precious did that tree become
  When I began to eat.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">The Lord Himself is food to me,
  He is my life supply;
He will my pure enjoyment be,
  None else can satisfy.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">I freely eat this living tree,
  For eating is the way
To put God's life inside of me,
  To live by Him today.</stanza>
