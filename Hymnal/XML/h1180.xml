  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">My old person has been nullified;
With my Lord upon the cross he died;
Now in nothing shall he be applied;
  He's dead to me.
My new Person in my spirit dwells;
Springing in me as a bubbling well;
Flowing out until each part He fills
  With abundant life.
  Christ, my Person, in my spirit lives;
  And my heart to Him I'd daily give;
  That my inner man could have a home
  And a place to settle down, yes,
  A place to call His own, and&amp;mdash;
  There be my complete reality,
  There expressing all He is to me,
  Living in my heart abundantly
    As my Person real.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">By this Person being formed in me,
I'll a member of His Body be,
No more acting individually,
  But with the saints.
More and more our Person He must be;
That our natural personality
Be eliminated thoroughly
  Till Christ is all.
  Only Christ, our Person, must remain;
  From our aims, our goals we must refrain,
  Till the church be only Christ Himself
  Built up as the one new man,
  Thus fulfilling God's great plan of&amp;mdash;
  Mingling fully with the human race
  To obtain a proper dwelling place,
  'Stablishing His kingdom's rule and grace;
    Over all the earth.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Not Himself just individually,
But the church together corporately,
Taking Christ as all in all, to be
    The full-grown, perfect man.</stanza>
