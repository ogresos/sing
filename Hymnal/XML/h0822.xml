  <lyrics>
	<stanza type="verse" number="1">The Church the lampstand is to Christ,
Christ is the lamp with God as light;
The light divine from Christ doth shine,
The Church upholds its glory bright.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">The light which shines within the lamp
Is God as life, unique, divine;
The stand must therefore be of gold
To match the glory which doth shine.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">Amid the darkness of this age
The light of life divine doth beam
In many centers of mankind
Where Jesus' testimony's seen.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">To be this testimony pure
"First love" to Christ the Church must keep;
Then from the "tree of life" she may
The overcomer's portion reap.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">She must the persecution bear
That she the "crown of life" may gain;
Adult'ry spiritual o'ercome,
The "hidden manna" to obtain.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">The deeds of "Jezebel" desert,
That she may rule the earth with might;
Defiling deadness overcome
To be arrayed in "garments white."</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">Like "Philadelphia" she must be
To keep Christ's word, confess His Name;
All "lukewarm" pride she must o'ercome
To feast with Him who overcame.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="8">Thus will the Church be purified
To be the lampstand of pure gold,
To match the testimony pure,
The life of Jesus fit to hold.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="9">The local churches here on earth
The lampstands in this age should be;
The glorious new Jerusalem
The lampstand in eternity.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="10">That city as pure gold will be,
The final lampstand consummate;
Christ as the lamp she e'er will hold
And God's full light will radiate.</stanza>
