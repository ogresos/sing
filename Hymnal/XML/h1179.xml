	<stanza type="verse" number="1">My old man has been crucified with Him,
With all its foul corruption deep within;
And buried too its nature serpentine,
Completely finished&amp;mdash;this great fact is mine,
  I hold it fast.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">But there's a Person in my spirit now,
Born as a babe so small, so weak, so low;
Who by the Word's pure milk will grow to be
The overcoming inner man in me
  To gain my heart.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">Christ as my Person must possess my heart
And be preeminent in every part.
The former owner died but haunts it still.
O Lord, move in; my mind, emotion, will
  Now welcome Thee.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">In spirit mingled, we are one, O Lord,
The human and divine in one accord;
Yet Thou must have a proper faculty
That all Thy glorious personality
  May be expressed.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">So, Lord, I give my heart to Thee today,
That it may be Thy home in every way,
A place for Thee to come and settle down,
And all Thy grand recovery work to crown
  In one new man.</stanza>
