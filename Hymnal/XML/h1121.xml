    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Praise the Lord, who firmly joined us
  Unto the Anointed One.
Thus we all have been anointed
  With th' anointing of the Son.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Now in Christ, in the anointing,
  We are the anointed ones.
Oh, how blessed is this ointment
  Poured upon the many sons!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Hallelujah, the anointing
  Unto us God's essence brings;
It is now abiding in us,
  And it teaches us all things.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">We're the Lord's peculiar treasure,
  Purchased by His precious blood.
He has put His seal upon us,
  We are those marked out by God.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Day by day we're under sealing,
  That we may His likeness share.
By the impress of His Person
  We will Jesus' image bear.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Now we have the pledge, the foretaste,
  Of the Christ we soon will see.
We are longing for the full taste&amp;mdash;
  God, our feast eternally.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">God has wrought us for this purpose,
  Giving us the earnest here,
Guarantee of full enjoyment
  Of our Lord Himself, so dear.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">The anointing, seal, and earnest&amp;mdash;
  In our spirit are all three.
Such a wondrous, blest deposit
  God has given you and me.</stanza>
