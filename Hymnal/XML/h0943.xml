    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Requirements of the Kingdom are
Much stricter than the law's decrees;
No other requisite of God
Has ever higher been than these.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">"Repent, the Kingdom has come near,"
This is the Kingdom's first demand;
A change of mind we all must have
And on God's side must firmly stand.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">That we the Kingdom enter in,
Surpassing righteousness we need,
Exceeding that which is of law;
From life alone it must proceed.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">That we the Kingdom enter in,
We need to do the Father's will,
Not by our choice to work or act
But His one purpose to fulfill.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">That we the Kingdom enter in,
A simple child we must become&amp;mdash;
Adjustable, obedient, meek&amp;mdash;
And everything of self o'ercome.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">The Heav'nly Kingdom e'en requires
That we as God should perfect be;
This standard we must fully meet
That we may share its ecstasy.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">The Kingdom is the reign of God;
To match His nature is required;
'Tis only by the life of God
The Kingdom's entry is acquired.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">The Kingdom is the rule of heav'n;
With heaven's state we must accord;
'Tis only by the life of heav'n
That we may share it with the Lord.</stanza>
