	<stanza type="verse" number="1">To Jesus every day we find our hearts are closer drawn;
He's fairer than the sons of men and fresher than the morn;
He's all that we can say of Him in fairest words and more,
And every day He's dearer than He was the day before.</stanza>
	<stanza type="chorus" number="">The half cannot be fancied of such a treasure-store,
  And every day He's dearer than He ever was before!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">His glory broke upon us when we saw Him in the church,
For here are all His riches, here we've given up our search;
'Tis here He satisfies our longing spirits o'er and o'er,
And every day He's dearer than He was the day before.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">Now He's the living Spirit who within our spirit dwells,
And by His sweet anointing, how His life within us swells!
As with the saints we're meeting, full released our spirits soar,
For now our Lord is dearer than He ever was before.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">The Lord has made us one with Him for His recovery:
The riches of this Christ, the church His fullness, men must see.
Yes, all we have and all we are, we every day outpour
For His tremendous purpose, ever dearer than before.</stanza>
