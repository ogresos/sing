	<stanza type="verse" number="1">We gather together to eat the Lord's supper:
By eating and drinking, our oneness we show.
His presence possessing, our oneness confessing,
'Tis thus we eat and drink, and His blessing we know.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">We're eating the bread of His body once broken
As now we're enjoying His Body made one:
One loaf on the table&amp;mdash;one Body, we're able
To testify to all that the Lord's made us one.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">We also are drinking the cup of His blessing,
The church's true fellowship of the Lord's blood;
Redeemed by believing, all saints we're receiving,
All those who through redemption have come unto God.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">Oh, what can we say now except "Hallelujah!"
For such a reality given to us.
Thy blood we're employing, Thy Body enjoying;
Thus Thou wilt have the church for Thyself glorious.</stanza>
