    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Lord, to know Thee as the Body,
Is my desperate need today,
Oh, to see Thee in Thy members,
'Tis for this I long and pray.
No more just to know Thy headship
In an individual way,
But to see Thee incarnated,
As the Body-Christ, I pray.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Through the years, Thy saints have sought Thee,
Longing for reality;
Gazing upward, searching inward,
Thirsting for the sight of Thee.
Now reveal that Christ in heaven,
Is the Body manifest;
And the Christ who dwells within us
As the Body is expressed.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Prone to be misled, I know it,
By my lofty thoughts of Thee,
Easy 'tis for self to seek Thee,
Yet not touch reality,
Oh, how much I need to find Thee,
In Thy members here below.
God eternal dwells among us,
Manifest in flesh to know.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Limit, Lord, my independence,
Let me to Thy Body turn;
Not just seeking light from heaven,
But the church's sense to learn.
May we be the stones for building
Not the formless, useless clay,
Gain in us Thy heart's desire
Corporately Thyself display.</stanza>
