	<stanza type="verse" number="1">What release the Savior gave me!
  Christ indeed has set me free!
All the pow'r of sin is broken,
  All death's sting is passed from me!</stanza>
	<stanza type="chorus" number="">Christ has made me more than conqu'ror,
  By His mighty victory,
Now His resurrection power
    From my spirit strengthens me!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">From the law Christ has delivered,
  To its claims I'm ever dead;
Nevermore the law shall bind me,
  But by grace I'll live instead.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">Christ has sin condemned at Calv'ry
  And its power done away;
Now it has no ground within me,
  I am freed from all its sway.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">Death by Him has been abolished,
  Incorrupted life is shown;
Death's enthralling bonds are broken,
  Resurrection life is known.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">Christ through death has crushed the devil,
  World and demons by His might,
From the pow'r of darkness brought me
  To the realm of life and light.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">All-sufficient grace He giveth,
  With His pow'r He covers me,
Makes me glory in my weakness
  And in weakness strengthens me.</stanza>
