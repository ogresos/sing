	<stanza type="verse" number="1">Christ the Savior is just the One you need,
He's God incarnate, as a man indeed;
In His body He suffered every pain
And died to cleanse your every stain,
  So you need Jesus!</stanza>
	<stanza type="chorus" number="">You need Jesus! You need Jesus!
  Men and women all need Him!
For redemption you need Him,
For salvation you need Him!
And for everlasting life,
    Yes, you need Jesus!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">He has risen and gone up into heav'n,
That life eternal might be fully giv'n;
Just receive Him, believing in your heart,
Then all you need He will impart,
  So you need Jesus!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">He'll enlighten your darkened heart with light,
Forgive your sins and rescue you with might;
He will cleanse you from all stains with His blood,
And give to you the life of God,
  So you need Jesus!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">In your living there is a lack you sense,
And thru the years it grows the more intense;
Only Jesus this need can satisfy;
All vanity He will defy,
  So you need Jesus!</stanza>
	<stanza type="chorus" number="">You need Jesus! You need Jesus!
  Men and women all need Him!
To escape from vanity,
To obtain reality,
To make life significant,
    Yes, you need Jesus!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">All this world now is rife with toil and pain,
In troubled times there's nothing to sustain;
All is empty, on what can you rely?
All things reveal and testify
  That you need Jesus!</stanza>
