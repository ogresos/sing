    <stanza type="verse" number="1">O praise the Lord, God has a plan&amp;mdash;
That's why He formed a man;
To exercise authority,
Subdue the earth entirely.
O what a joy to be
In His recovery,
O praise God He made me a V.I.P.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">O hallelujah, Christ became
A man to die for me.
And dying once my life to be,
In spirit now He lives in me.
The man supreme is He,
My all He came to be;
O hallelujah, He lives in me!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">O hallelujah, I'm a man,
The center of God's plan.
I'm God's own image made to be,
Expressing His authority.
It's great to be a man,
O praise God, I'm a man,
O hallelujah, I am a man!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">O hallelujah, one new man,
The building of God's plan!
God's plan throughout eternity&amp;mdash;
Not man, but men built corporately.
This man cannot be beat,
All things beneath his feet,
Christ and the church one man complete.</stanza>
