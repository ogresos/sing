  <lyrics>
	<stanza type="verse" number="1">To the holiest place I'd come,
There within the veil to be;
There to touch the throne of grace,
Let life's water flow thru me.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">Now the holiest place of all
Right within my spirit is;
Here the Lord in me abides,
And my spirit joins with His.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">To my spirit I'd return,
For 'tis here the Lord I'll meet;
O how marvellous it is!
He's within, in me complete.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">Fragrance of the risen Christ
Thru my spirit may be spread;
If in spirit I will pray
Christ will be exhibited.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">If in spirit Him I touch,
With His riches filled I'll be;
Life and light and love and grace
As a stream will flow thru me.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">Touching deeply, richly I
Of Himself experience,
Thus the law of life I touch
And His clear anointing sense.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">In my spirit deeper still
I would touch the Lord I love,
Touch Him in His hidden depth
And His hidden manna prove.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="8">When the resurrection life
Is made real in pow'r to me,
As the rod with sprouting buds,
I will then accepted be.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="9">Here I find the throne of grace,
Where the living water flows
As a river full of grace
Into me grace to bestow.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="10">Then whene'er we meet to pray,
All our spirits we'll release;
Mingled will our spirits be,
And we'll serve the Lord as priests.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="11">This the holiest place is too,
Where we all may touch the Lord,
Touch His throne in many ways
Till His grace on us is poured.</stanza>
