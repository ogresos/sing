    <stanza type="verse" number="1">See the local churches,
'Midst the earth's dark night;
Jesus' testimony,
Bearing Him as light.
Formed by Him, unmeasured,
In the Spirit's mold&amp;mdash;
All are one in nature,
One pure work of gold.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">See the local churches,
'Midst the earth's dark night;
Burning in the Spirit,
  Shining forth with Christ.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">God in Christ, embodied,
As God's lampstand, He
Has become the Spirit,
The reality.
Spirit as the lampstand
Has been multiplied;
Many local churches,
Now are realized!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Caring for the churches
Is the Son of Man:
Voice of many waters,
Stars in His right hand;
Eyes aflame; His face is
Shining as the sun;
Churches&amp;mdash;fear no trial,
He's the living One!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">What can quench the lampstands?
Who can them defy?
More the opposition&amp;mdash;
More they multiply!
Deeper darkness 'round them,
Brighter do they shine.
They are constituted
With the life divine.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Soon the local churches
Shall the Bride become,
Bringing in that city&amp;mdash;
New Jerusalem.
Then the many lampstands
Shall one lampstand be;
Triune God expressing,
Universally.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Lo, from heav'n descending,
All the earth shall see
God's complete expression,
  For eternity.</stanza>
