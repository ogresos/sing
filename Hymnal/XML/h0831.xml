  <lyrics>
	<stanza type="verse" number="1">The unity of Church is but
  The saints in oneness living;
The Spirit which indwelleth them
  This oneness ever giving.
Thus it is realized and called
  The unity of Spirit;
'Tis based upon the common faith
  Which all the saints inherit.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">This precious faith of all the saints,
  Is constituted solely
Of Christ and His redemptive work,
  Which are unique and holy.
In this the saints are truly one,
  Together all agreeing,
And it is from this common faith
  The Church came into being.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">The Church within the universe
  Is one as Christ's possession;
The Church must therefore locally
  Be one in her expression;
For all her elements are one&amp;mdash;
  One God, one Lord, one Spirit,
One faith, baptism, Body too,
  One hope all saints inherit.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">This oneness is the Church's ground,
  The ground of common standing,
The only ground of unity
  The Spirit is demanding.
The Church in actual practise thus
  May keep her vital union,
And her expressions locally
  Be built up in communion.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">Lord, help us ever strive to keep
  This unity by taking
The Church's ground of unity,
  The Body-life partaking,
That all Thy heart's profound desire
  May fully be effected,
And God's eternal purpose may
  Completely be perfected.</stanza>
