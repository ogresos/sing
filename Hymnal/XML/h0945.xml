    <stanza type="verse" number="1">The Son of God has come to sow
Himself, the seed of life, in man,
That thru Himself God's Kingdom grow
And thus fulfill th' eternal plan.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">He was the only grain of wheat
Whence many grains have been produced
To be the Kingdom's children meet,
Thru whom God's reign is introduced.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">But Satan, enemy of God,
Sowed many tares among the wheat,
The Kingdom's children to confuse,
And awful damage to create.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">'Tis by this subtle work of his,
The mixing of the tares with wheat,
The Kingdom in appearance is
Abnormal and grotesquely great.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">The Kingdom should as mustard be,
A little herb, yet good for food,
But it has changed into a "tree,"
A system of great magnitude.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Instead of being good for food,
A lodge of "birds" it has become:
'Tis now a place where evil men
And evil spirits make their home.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">A great religion of the world
Its outward form to us reveals.
Including pagan, evil things,
As leaven mingled with the meal.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">A system of the world as such,
It thus has changed in outward form;
By evil things which it imbibes,
Corruption inwardly doth swarm.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="9">But something hidden God doth seek,
As "pearl" and "treasure in the field";
As such the Lord would us transform
That pearl and treasure be revealed.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="10">'Tis hidden from vast Christendom
And from the Kingdom's great facade,
Yet in its full reality
'Tis transformed like to Christ and God.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="11">Lord, separate us from the "tares,"
And save us from the monstrous "tree";
From all the "leaven" purge us now
That we may purely be of Thee.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="12">May Thou in life transform our souls
That we as precious stones may be,
Meet for Thy house to build and in
Thy Kingdom's full reality.</stanza>
