    <stanza type="verse" number="1">There is no gain but by a loss;
We cannot save but by the cross,
The corn of wheat to multiply
Must fall into the ground and die;
O should a soul alone remain
When it a hundredfold can gain?
O should a soul alone remain
When it a hundredfold can gain?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Our souls are held by all they hold;
Slaves still are slaves in chains of gold;
To whatsoever we may cling,
We make it a soul-chaining thing.
Whether it be a life or land,
And dear as our right eye or hand.
Whether it be a life or land,
And dear as our right eye or hand.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Wherever you ripe fields behold,
Waving to God their sheaves of gold,
Be sure some com of wheat has died,
Some saintly soul been crucified;
Someone has suffered, wept and prayed,
And fought hell's legions undismayed.
Someone has suffered, wept and prayed,
And fought hell's legions undismayed.</stanza>
