    <stanza type="verse" number="1">The birthright God has giv'n to us
Must be our goal, our highest prize,
For we're the church of the first-born&amp;mdash;
Let us our portion realize!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">A double portion of the land
Was Joseph's birthright&amp;mdash;and 'tis ours
If we our garments keep from sin,
And stay pure in temptation's hour.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">The priesthood was to Levi giv'n
As his inheritance&amp;mdash;for he
Did count his family ties but loss
And owned God's things supreme to be.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">The kingship, Judah did receive
For tending to young Joseph's need;
Through Benjamin's adversity,
He was his comforter indeed.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">The double portion we would seek,
The priesthood and the kingship too;
Make us so desperate, Lord, for Thee
That Thee, our birthright, we'd pursue.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">We would be those who pay the price,
Deny the soul, reject the self;
Ambitious for the birthright thus
We'd gain Thee, Lord, above all else.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">The promise, Lord, 'twas giv'n to us,
Oh, let us ne'er this right despise;
Enflame us, Lord, to gain Thyself,
And Thee, our birthright realize.</stanza>
