    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Once I was dead in sin,
  And hope within me died;
But now I'm dead to sin,
  With Christ I'm crucified.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">And can it be that "He loved me,
    And gave Himself for me"?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">O height I cannot reach!
  O depth I cannot sound!
O love, O boundless love,
  In my Redeemer found!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">I live&amp;mdash;and yet not I,
  But Christ that lives in me,
Who from the law of sin
  And death has made me free.</stanza>
