    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Praise the Savior, ye who know Him!
Who can tell how much we owe Him?
Gladly let us render to Him
  All we are and have.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Jesus is the name that charms us;
He for conflicts fits and arms us;
Nothing moves and nothing harms us
  When we trust in Him.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Trust in Him, ye saints, forever;
He is faithful, changing never;
Neither force nor guile can sever
  Those He loves from Him.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Keep us, Lord, oh, keep us cleaving
To Thyself and still believing,
Till the hour of Thy receiving
  The victorious Bride.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Then we shall be where we would be;
Then we shall be what we should be;
Things which are not now, nor could be,
  Then shall be our own.</stanza>
