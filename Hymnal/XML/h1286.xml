  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">The Lord has shown the way
  Within the church today&amp;mdash;
It's laboring, laboring, laboring on Christ.
  Christ is the Canaan land;
  In Him we boldly stand,
While laboring, laboring, laboring on Christ.
  On to victory! On to victory!
  Cries our great Commander&amp;mdash;On!
    We'll move at His command
    And now possess the land
  Through laboring, laboring, laboring on Christ.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">The way that God has planned
  To labor on the land
Is "Amen, Lord! Amen, Lord! Amen to Your Word!"
  Whene'er He speaks today,
  Whatever He may say,
It's "Amen, Lord! Amen, Lord! Amen to Your Word!"
  On to victory! On to victory!
  Cries our great Commander&amp;mdash;On!
    We'll move at His command
    And now possess the land
  By "Amen, Lord! Amen, Lord! Amen to Your Word!"</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">The Lord has also shown
  The land we'll fully own
By following, following, following the church.
  Where'er the Body goes,
  Howe'er the Spirit flows,
It's following, following, following the church.
  On to victory! On to victory!
  Cries our great Commander&amp;mdash;On!
    We'll move at His command
    And now possess the land
  By following, following, following the church.</stanza>
