    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Power, exceeding great pow'r is to us,
  To us who believe, us who receive!
Power that raised Christ, yes, pow'r glorious
  Is giv'n to His Body, the church!
  There is pow'r, pow'r, resurrection pow'r,
    To the church, to the church!
  There is pow'r, pow'r, resurrection pow'r,
    Given to His Body, the church!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Power that set Christ at God's own right hand,
  This pow'r is to us&amp;mdash;yes, even us!
Power above every name that is named
  Is giv'n to His Body, the church!
  There is pow'r, pow'r, all-transcending pow'r,
    To the church, to the church!
  There is pow'r, pow'r, all-transcending pow'r,
    Given to His Body, the church!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Power that put all things under His feet
  Is ours here and now&amp;mdash;right here and now!
Power subjecting all, power complete,
  Is giv'n to His Body, the church!
  There is pow'r, pow'r, all-subduing pow'r,
    To the church, to the church!
  There is pow'r, pow'r, all-subduing pow'r,
    Given to His Body, the church!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Power that made Him o'er all things the Head
  Is now to the church, now to the church!
Power, such pow'r, will be exhibited
  O'er all through His Body, the church!
  There is pow'r, pow'r, overruling pow'r,
    To the church, to the church!
  There is pow'r, pow'r, overruling pow'r,
    Given to His Body, the church!</stanza>
