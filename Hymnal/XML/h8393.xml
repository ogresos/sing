    <stanza type="verse" number="1">He is the joy of joys;
My thirst He satisfied.
He is the Song of songs;
We mutually abide.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Fairest of all the fair;
He pleases me in full.
Noble of nobles, He
My prize unmatchable.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Life of all lives is He;
From death He makes me rise.
Holy of holies, from
The world He sanctifies.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Righteous of righteous ones,
In Him I stand each day.
He is the Strength of strengths,
Refreshing on the way.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">He, as the Pow'r of pow'rs,
Renews with eagles' wings;
Vict'ry of victories,
O'er all my foes He brings.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Able of able ones,
My being He sets free;
He is the Might of mights,
In spirit strength'ning me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">He is the King of kings,
Who now reigns in my heart;
He is the Light of lights,
Illum'ning every part.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">He is the Lord of lords,
He now lives in my heart;
He is the Way of ways,
Who every step does chart.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="9">Healing of healings, He
Cures spirit, body, soul;
Wonder of wonders, He;
I'll share His glory full.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="10">Hope of all hopes is He,
Drawing my heart above;
The greatest prize to me,
He guides my steps in love.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="11">He is the Love of loves,
Worthy to be adored;
Patience of patience He,
Worthy of praise outpoured.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="12">Greatest of all the great,
My adulations raise;
Glory of glories He,
Deserving all my praise.</stanza>
