    <stanza type="verse" number="1">There was One who was willing to die in my stead,
  That a soul so unworthy might live,
And the path to the cross He was willing to tread
  All the sins of my life to forgive.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">They were borne on the cross,
They were borne on the cross,
O how much He was willing to bear!
With what anguish and loss,
Jesus went to the cross!
But He carried my sins with Him there.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">He is tender and loving and patient with me,
  While He cleanses my heart of its dross;
But "there's no condemnation," I know I am free,
  For my sins were all borne on the cross.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">I will cling to my Savior and never depart&amp;mdash;
  I will joyfully journey each day,
With a song on my lips and a song in my heart,
  That my sins have been taken away.</stanza>
