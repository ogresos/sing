    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Christ is the testimony true
Of God in essence and in deed;
God's glory He has fully shown,
And we in Him God's nature read.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">His testimony is more full
Than was the witness of the law,
Which only God in letter showed,
And not in endless living pow'r.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">The fulness of the Godhead dwells
In Him, His very element;
God's full embodiment is He&amp;mdash;
A vessel, God the resident.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">The Father God He manifests;
God's glorious features He displays;
In Him consummately are seen
The Father's heart and all His ways.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Christ as the Spirit now has come
That He our portion be fore'er;
In spirit we partake of Him
And all God's being fully share.</stanza>
