    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Redeemed&amp;mdash;how I love to proclaim it!
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed through His infinite mercy,
His child, and forever, I am.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Redeemed, redeemed,
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed, redeemed,
  His child, and forever, I am.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Redeemed and so happy in Jesus,
No language my rapture can tell;
I know that the light of His presence
With me doth continually dwell.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">I think of my blessed Redeemer,
I think of Him all the day long;
I sing, for I cannot be silent;
His love is the theme of my song.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">I know I shall see in His beauty
The King in whose way I delight;
Who lovingly guardeth my footsteps,
And giveth me songs in the night.</stanza>
