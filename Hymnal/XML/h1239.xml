    <stanza type="verse" number="1">In this age we're being turned
To the Spirit to be burned;
Now in spirit we can see
Christ, the church, our unity!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">In the spirit we can taste
All the riches of Thy grace;
All Thy fullness, blessed Lord
Is for those in one accord!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">In the spirit, on the ground&amp;mdash;
Here is where Thy life is found.
Dwelling thus in unity,
We enjoy reality!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Out of death and into life,
Done with all divisive strife!
Free indeed to love but Thee,
Growing to maturity!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">"Amen, Jesus," is our prayer
To the purging work, whate'er;
Now Thy church must desperate be
More the growth in life to see.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">O Lord, make Thy home our heart,
Our true inner man Thou art;
God and man are mingled thus&amp;mdash;
Christ, the church, all glorious!</stanza>
