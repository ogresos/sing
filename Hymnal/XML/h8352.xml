    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Though we are often swayed and tossed,
Changeless forever He endures;
None of His promises are lost;
None is so sure in heav'n or earth.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Though we are fickle, change our mind,
He'll ne'er forsake us, never leave;
Even when spurned, He draws us nigh;
No earthly friend's as true as He.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">He'll never once our trust betray;
All we entrust Him, He upholds.
As first He loved, He loves always,
Loving us to the uttermost.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Such love! To us who, conscience seared,
Wounded, forgot Him faithlessly,
To us who many gods revered,
Hearts void of all apology.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">When all our idols ceased to be,
Sadly we sought Him once again
Whom we'd let down continually,
Our first-to-last unchanging Friend.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Yet He accepts us and consoles
And to Himself He draws us nigh
As though no fault e'er marred our souls,
He loves us to the end of time.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Lord, when such faithful love we see,
Loudly we praise with heart and voice;
Stronger than death, steadfast than seas;
Melted, our hearts admire, rejoice!</stanza>
