    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Christ will make His seeking lover
  Pillar, couch, and palanquin,
E'en a crown, His boast and glory;
  He will do it all! Amen!</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">His beloved&amp;mdash;how He loves her,
  So attractive, His delight.
He is captivated wholly;
    She is comely in His sight.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">But there still remains a shadow;
  Christ is still not satisfied.
He must have a growing garden
  To become His loving Bride!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Paradise of pomegranates,
  Pleasant fruits, and henna flowers,
Spikenard, saffron, myrrh, and aloes:
  His enjoyment now&amp;mdash;not ours.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">He has come into His garden,
  Gathered myrrh and spices there,
Eaten honeycomb and honey;
  Wine and milk He'll drink fore'er.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">From the garden comes the city,
  All materials thus supplied;
God is satisfied completely,
  And the foe is terrified.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">"Thou art fair, my love, as Tirzah,
  Comely as Jerusalem."
O Lord Jesus, Hallelujah,
  Thou wilt do it all! Amen!</stanza>
