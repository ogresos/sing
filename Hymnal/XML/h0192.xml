    <stanza type="verse" number="1">We come, O Christ, to Thee,
  True Son of God and man,
By whom all things consist,
  In whom all life began:
In Thee alone we live and move
And have our being in Thy love.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Thou art the Way to God,
  Thy blood our ransom paid;
In Thee we face our Judge
  And Maker unafraid.
Before the Throne absolved we stand:
Thy love has met Thy law's demand.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Thou art the living Truth!
  All wisdom dwells in Thee,
Thou Source of every skill,
  Eternal Verity!
Thou great I Am! In Thee we rest,
True answer to our every quest.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Thou only art true Life,
  To know Thee is to live
The more abundant life
  That earth can never give:
O Risen Lord! We live in Thee
And Thou in us eternally!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">We worship Thee Lord Christ,
  Our Savior and our King,
To Thee our youth and strength
  Adoringly we bring:
So fill our hearts that men may see
Thy life in us and turn to Thee!</stanza>
