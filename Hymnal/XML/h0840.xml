  <lyrics>
	<stanza type="verse" number="1">Freed from self and Adam's nature,
  Lord, I would be built by Thee
With the saints into Thy temple,
  Where Thy glory we shall see.
From peculiar traits deliver,
  From my independent ways,
That a dwelling place for Thee, Lord,
  We will be thru all our days.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">By Thy life and by its flowing
  I can grow and be transformed,
With the saints coordinated,
  Builded up, to Thee conformed;
Keep the order in the Body,
  There to function in Thy will,
Ever serving, helping others,
  All Thy purpose to fulfill.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">In my knowledge and experience
  I would not exalted be,
But submitting and accepting
  Let the Body balance me;
Holding fast the Head, and growing
  With His increase, in His way,
By the joints and bands supplying,
  Knit together day by day.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">By Thy Spirit daily strengthened
  In the inner man with might,
I would know Thy love surpassing,
  Know Thy breadth and length and height;
Ever of Thy riches taking,
  Unto all Thy fulness filled,
Ever growing into manhood,
  That Thy Body Thou may build.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">In God's house and in Thy Body
  Builded up I long to be,
That within this corporate vessel
  All shall then Thy glory see;
That Thy Bride, the glorious city,
  May appear upon the earth,
As a lampstand brightly beaming
  To express to all Thy worth.</stanza>
