    <stanza type="verse" number="1">We are the Hebrews! Praise the Lord!
We're from the other side.
Throughout our hist'ry we have passed
Through rivers deep and wide.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!
He has brought
All us river-crossing Hebrews
To the land, to build up
  The temple of our God.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Old Noah's age was so corrupt,
In deep depravity;
So Noah passed across the flood&amp;mdash;
That separating sea.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Praise the Lord! He has brought
From the old
To a new recovered region
Where he built in this land
  An altar for his God.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Then Abraham was called apart,
For Godto take a stand;
So through the river he was led
Into a new, good land.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Step by step he was led
From Chaldee
Through the river into Canaan,
That good land, there to be
  The servant of his God.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">The Israelites in bondage were
To Pharaoh's choking hand.
The God of Hebrews made a way
For them to leave that land.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Through the sea, they all passed;
Egypt fell,
Hallelujah! In the good land
They built up God's own house
  To satisfy His heart.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Then wand'ring through the wilderness,
The land they could not find;
Till through the Jordan they did pass
To leave themselves behind.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Praise the Lord! In the land
They built up
God's own temple. Hallelujah!
Praise the Lord! There they dwelt,
  His people and their God.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">But then religion conquered all,
So John the Baptist came
And buried all beneath that flood.
The Jews were not the same.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Buried all! Buried all!
Buried all!
Underneath the Jordan River
Buried all to become
  The Hebrews passing through.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Now in the church life, we have left
The world, religion too;
Now we're the river-crossing ones,
Enjoying Christ so new!</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!
We have passed
From the oldness, Hallelujah,
Into Christ&amp;mdash;one new man.
  And now we're one with Him!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">O Lord, You've taken us across
The fiery sea of glass,
With all the worldly things beneath;
Across the sea we've passed.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!
Now we stand
As the Hebrews, Hallelujah,
On the sea! Praise the Lord!
  We've passed through everything!</stanza>
