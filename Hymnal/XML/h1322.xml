    <stanza type="verse" number="1">In spirit, in the church we see
The high estate we're destined for.
It's higher, vaster, more profound
Than anything we've seen before.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">It's not a view in doctrine bare
But an unveiling of the Christ.
He's marvelous and far beyond
Our mental thought or power to share.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">He's rich, unlimited, profound,
Immeasurable, and marvelous.
Yet 'tis a greater wonder still
He needs heirs of salvation&amp;mdash;us.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">God has accomplished many things&amp;mdash;
He's planned, created, and brought forth.
The Son is now appointed Heir,
Administrator of God's worth.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">But in th' economy of God
There is not one, but many sons.
One is the firstborn Son of God
With many other living ones.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Christ will inherit all God's things,
And we're the heirs of God with Christ.
We're growing now to be matured;
As heirs we'll soon be legalized.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">We're joint-heirs with the firstborn Son,
Inheriting the universe.
We're in this corporation vast&amp;mdash;
All partners of Christ and the church.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">In spirit, in the church, we see
Our calling of unrivaled worth.
We're destined, not to go to heaven.
We're destined to be kings on earth.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="9">We're paupers, yet we're glorious kings.
Inheriting the kingdom vast,
The earth, God's throne, and e'en all things
And all the Father is and has.</stanza>
