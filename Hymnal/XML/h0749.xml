	<stanza type="verse" number="1">The Spirit of the triune God
Within our spirit now doth rest;
He ever seeks thru us to flow,
That God in Christ may be expressed.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">But by the outward, natural man
The Spirit is confined within;
Instead of giving Him a home,
A prison we've become to Him.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">He's like a treasure of great worth
Contained in vessels earthen-made;
The vessel must be broken through
And thus the treasure be displayed.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">Oh, how the Lord our self must break,
Our outward man does so impede!
It must be broken thoroughly,
And thus the Spirit will be freed.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">This is the reason why the Lord
For us a certain measure makes
Of circumstantial suffering;
'Tis thus our outward man He breaks.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">The outward man, the self, the soul,
Must be consumed, must be decreased;
The inner man, our spirit, then
Shall with the Spirit be released.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">Lord, grant Thy holy brokenness,
Deliver me from being whole;
And make me willing to receive
The wounds that Thou wouldst give my soul.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="8">Oh, cause me to appreciate
Thy breaking, never to complain;
And grant that I may value more
All kinds of loss instead of gain.</stanza>
