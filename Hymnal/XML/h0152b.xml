    <stanza type="verse" number="1">O how deep and how far-reaching
  Is Thy love, dear Lord, to me!
Far beyond my pow'r to fathom,
  Deeper than the deepest sea!
It has caused Thee death to suffer
  And to me Thyself impart,
That in Thee I might be grafted
  And become of Thee a part.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Who can tell of all the wonders
  Which Thy love for me has wrought,
Yet the greatest of these wonders
  Is that Thou to me art brought.
Oh! to me Thy love has given
  All Thou art as my supply;
As true life I now may share Thee
  And Thy riches e'er enjoy.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Lord, Thy love is the expression
  Of Thy loving self divine,
Making life so full of meaning,
  Harmonized with God's design.
Grace of life, how all-sufficient,
  Is my portion day by day;
I'm the object of Thy favor
  And Thy sweetness taste alway.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">What from Thee can separate me?
  Thou wilt love me to the end!
Oh! Thy love is so prevailing,
  E'en Thyself with me to blend!
We two one will be for ever;
  I am Thine and Thou art mine!
This will be my testimony:
  In Thy love we'll ever twine!</stanza>
