    <stanza type="verse" number="1">And is it so! I shall be like Thy Son?
Is this the grace which He for me has won?
Father of glory&amp;mdash;thought beyond all thought!
In glory, to His own blest likeness brought!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Oh, Jesus, Lord, who loved me like to Thee?
Fruit of Thy work, with Thee, too, there to see
Thy glory, Lord, while endless ages roll,
Myself the prize and travail of Thy soul.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Yet it must be: Thy love had not its rest
Were Thy redeemed not with Thee fully blest;
That love that gives not as the world, but shares
All it possesses with its loved co-heirs.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Nor I alone; Thy loved ones, all complete
In glory, round Thee there with joy shall meet
All like Thee, for Thy glory like Thee, Lord,
Object supreme of all, by all adored.</stanza>
