  <lyrics>
	<stanza type="verse" number="1">When we walk with the Lord
  In the light of His Word,
What a glory He sheds on our way;
  While we do His good will,
  He abides with us still,
And with all who will trust and obey.</stanza>
	<stanza type="chorus" number="">Trust and obey,
For there's no other way
To be happy in Jesus,
  But to trust and obey.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">Not a shadow can rise,
  Not a cloud in the skies,
But His smile quickly drives it away;
  Not a doubt or a fear,
  Not a sigh or a tear,
Can abide while we trust and obey.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">Not a burden we bear,
  Not a sorrow we share,
But our toil He doth richly repay;
  Not a grief or a loss,
  Not a frown or a cross,
But is blest if we trust and obey.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">But we never can prove
  The delights of His love,
Until all on the altar we lay;
  For the favor He shows,
  And the joy He bestows,
Are for them who will trust and obey.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">Then in fellowship sweet
  We will sit at His feet,
Or we'll walk by His side in the way;
  What He says we will do;
  Where He sends, we will go,
Never fear, only trust and obey.</stanza>
