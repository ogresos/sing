  <lyrics>
	<stanza type="verse" number="1">Praying to express the Lord,
We must not ourselves express,
But let Christ reveal Himself,
His desire in us impress.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">Praying to express the Lord,
We must utter His intent,
Quieting our human thoughts
That with His our mind be blent.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">Praying to express the Lord,
Ever looking unto Him
As a mirror to reflect
All His glory from within.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">Praying to express the Lord,
Letting Him beseech in us;
Christ indwelling prays within
To the Christ in heaven thus.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">Praying to express the Lord,
Learning not to pray by self,
Praying wholly with the Lord,
Praying only by Himself.</stanza>
