    <stanza type="verse" number="1">The Holy Spirit is the seal,
The foretaste, earnest, and the pledge.
He designates us as God's own
And guarantees our heritage.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">'Twas after we believed in Christ,
The word of truth, the gospel, heard,
The Holy Spirit us did seal
To show that we belong to God.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">This Spirit as the living seal,
To us God's image now imparts;
Conforming us unto the Son,
He stamps His image in our hearts.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">This Spirit also is the pledge,
Our earnest and our foretaste true.
He witnesses that we are sons,
With God's inheritance in view.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">'Tis by this Spirit God does spread
Into our mind, emotion, will;
By sealing every inward part,
He will our very being fill.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Oh Lord, we would cooperate
With all Thy Spirit's inward move;
That we'd become Thy masterpiece,
Th' eternal purpose thus to prove.</stanza>
