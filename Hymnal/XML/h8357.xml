    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Joined to the Christ victorious,
  And workings of His cross,
I'm nourished e'en in sufferings,
  And safe in any loss.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Joined to the Christ, the risen One,
  Ascended into heav'n;
In light of the eternal cross,
  Unbounded grace is giv'n.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Joined to the Christ victorious,
  My spirit's joys increase;
I call the holy, highest name,
  And Satan's powers cease.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Joined to the Christ, the sovereign One,
  To Him I long to cling.
His cross has spoiled the serpent's work,
  Of vict'ry now I sing.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Joined to the Christâ€”how marvelous!
  God's great salvation this!
"The Lamb is worthy," well we sing,
  All praise and power His.</stanza>
