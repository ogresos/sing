Then shall I know as I am known, And sing His praise be -- fore the throne; Then shall I know as I am known, And sing His praise be -- fore the throne.</singingstanza>

    <stanza type="verse" number="1">'Tis now in part I know His grace;
I catch sweet glimpses of His face,
But in that better world of His,
I shall behold Him as He is.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Then shall I know as I am known,
And sing His praise before the throne;
Then shall I know as I am known,
  And sing His praise before the throne.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">'Tis now in part I know His love;
Bright sunbeams shine from skies above;
But glories more exceeding far,
Shall rise beyond life's evening star.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">'Tis now in part I understand
The leadings of my Father's hand;
But I shall own His ways were right,
When welcomed to His presence bright.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">'Tis now in part, but O how sweet
To rest by faith at His dear feet;
Though now we see as through a glass,
The veil will lift, the shadows pass.</stanza>
