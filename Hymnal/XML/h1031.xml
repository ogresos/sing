    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Come, every soul by sin oppressed,
  There's mercy with the Lord;
And He will surely give you rest
  By trusting in His Word.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Only trust Him! Only trust Him!
  Only trust Him now!
He will save you! He will save you!
    He will save you now!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">For Jesus shed His precious blood
  Rich blessings to bestow;
Plunge now into the crimson flood
  That washeth white as snow.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Yes, Jesus is the Truth, the Way,
  That leads you into rest;
Believe in Him without delay,
  And you are fully blest.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Come then, and join the holy band,
  And on to glory go;
In Christ's redemption take your stand,
  And all His goodness know.</stanza>
