    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Just one touch as He moves along,
Pushed and pressed by the jostling throng,
Just one touch and the weak was strong,
  Cured by the Healer divine.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Just one touch as He passes by,
He will list to the faintest cry.
Come and be cured while the Lord is nigh,
    Christ is the Healer divine.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Just one touch! and He makes me whole,
Speaks sweet peace to my sin-sick soul,
At His feet all my burdens roll,
  Cured by the Healer divine.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Just one touch! and the work is done,
I am cured by the blessed Son,
I will sing while the ages run,
  Cured by the Healer divine.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Just one touch! and He turns to me,
O the love in His eyes I see!
I am His for He hears my plea,
  Cured by the Healer divine.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Just one touch! by His mighty power
He can heal thee this very hour,
Thou canst hear though the tempests low'r,
  Cured by the Healer divine.</stanza>
