    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Abide in Christ&amp;mdash;this highest blessing gain;
Each day sweet fellowship with Him maintain.
Abiding, He and we are joined as one;
In constant fellowship, all barriers gone.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Abide in Him, anointing then will flow;
In fellowship, the Spirit's lead we'll know.
Obeying, we His riches apprehend;
Led by the Spirit, we will be His friend.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Abide in Him, the light of grace will shine;
In fellowship, all shadows will decline.
Obey the light, His life in us will grow;
From darkness freed, our heart will comfort know.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Abiding, we are strengthened with each breath;
In fellowship, His life will swallow death.
Abiding, all our sighing turns to song;
In fellowship, our heart is gladdened, strong.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Abiding, this will Satan's strength disarm;
In fellowship, the world will lose its charm.
Abiding, we sin's power need not fear;
In fellowship, the self will disappear.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Abiding, thus conformed to Him we'll be;
In fellowship, His life fills constantly.
Abiding, we experience His power;
In fellowship, His riches, hour by hour.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Abiding, Lord, for Thee my spirit yearns;
In fellowship, Thy Spirit in me burns,
That all my being may be lost in Thee
And with Thee mingled through eternity.</stanza>
