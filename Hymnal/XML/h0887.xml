	<stanza type="verse" number="1">The name of Jesus is our stand,
  It is our victory;
Not on ourselves do we rely,
  But, mighty Lord, on Thee.
Our weapons are not arms of flesh,
  But ours the Spirit's sword,
And God's whole armor putting on,
  We battle in the Lord.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">Behold, the foe doth meet and plot,
  Stand firm in one accord!
Though war be fierce and darkness thick,
  Resist him in the Lord!
If one thru fear should backward turn,
  He undermines the rest.
Oh, do not let your brothers down,
  Nor by you be distressed.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">The devil knows his time is short,
  He is the more enraged,
And by his wiles would weaken us
  Before the battle's waged.
The trials now more numerous are,
  The suff'ring e'en more sore,
The force of hell opposing us
  More dreadful than before.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">What should our posture be today
  In such a desperate hour?
Should we our ease and pleasure seek
  And let the foe devour?
Or with increasing conflict strong,
  Courageous to endure?
'Tis here that life or death is won!
  Who will God's praise secure?</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">For Christ the Lord we then would stand,
  He is the Conqueror!
For Him we would endure the pain
  Until the fight is o'er.
The hour of triumph soon we'll see&amp;mdash;
  The Lord will come again;
If now we suffer for His sake,
  Then we with Him shall reign.</stanza>
