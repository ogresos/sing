    <stanza type="verse" number="1">"All in His hands"&amp;mdash;what confidence it brings
To tested hearts, to know that all the things
That make up life and circumstance, He holds
In His strong hands, and patiently unfolds
Th' eternal purpose of His sovereign Will&amp;mdash;
That all things shall His grace and glory fill.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">"All in His hands"? Then life with purpose moves
Within the circle of His will, and proves
It good, acceptable. The hands of man
Or Satan cannot mar or foil the plan
Which God ordained&amp;mdash;to manifest His Son
In earthen vessels, to a world undone.</stanza>
