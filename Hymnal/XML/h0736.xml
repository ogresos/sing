	<stanza type="verse" number="1">In ancient times the law of God
In letter was engraved on stone;
But now it is a law of life,
Which in our heart is written down.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">The law in letters good demands
And thus our utter weakness shows;
But now the law of life sustains,
And strength for God to please bestows.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">The law in letters brings to us
God's knowledge only outwardly;
But now the law of life supplies
A deeper knowledge inwardly.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">The law in letters can but rule
By dead commandments outwardly;
But now the law of life controls
By living knowledge inwardly.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">This living law is moving now
In all of our experience,
To regulate us from within
And check us by our inner sense.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">How deep its regulation is
Within the inmost part of us,
A living consciousness to give,
And God Himself impart to us.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">'Tis by this living law of life
We need no teaching outwardly,
For all God's living knowledge now
This law will teach us inwardly.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="8">Lord, teach us by this law to walk,
Its inner ruling to obey,
That we may of Thyself partake
And know Thee in a living way.</stanza>
