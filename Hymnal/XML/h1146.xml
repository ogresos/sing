    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Let us eat Jesus every day,
Eating His flesh in such a way
That in the trials great or small
He as a Man will be our all.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Eat, eat more of Jesus!
Eat, eat more of Jesus!
Why should we undernourished be
  When we have His humanity?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Let us drink Jesus till we see
That we are human, Jesusly!
Till rivers flood the barren ground
And quench the thirst of all around.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Drink, drink more of Jesus!
Drink, drink more of Jesus!
Why should we ever thirsty be
  When we have His humanity?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">We must eat Jesus till God can
Have the fulfillment of His plan&amp;mdash;
One man expressed for all to see,
One church in each locality.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">We'll masticate Jesus!
We'll masticate Jesus!
Then to the tent of meeting bring
  Jesus, our real meal offering.</stanza>
