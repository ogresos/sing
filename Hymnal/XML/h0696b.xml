    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Cast thou thy care upon the Lord,
  The care that loads thy heart;
Take Him this moment at His word,
  And let Him do His part.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">The need is deep, the care is great,
  The burden hard to bear;
Roll it on Him with all its weight,
  And leave it resting there.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">This heavy thing, it is His gift,
  His portion, thee to bless;
Give it Him back; what He shall lift
  No more on thee shall press.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Cast all thy care, and not a part,
  The great things and the small;
The Lord's all-loving, mighty heart
  Has room and thought for all.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Yes, He will ponder every care,
  Consider each detail;
Thyself, thy burden, let Him bear;
  He will not, cannot, fail.</stanza>
