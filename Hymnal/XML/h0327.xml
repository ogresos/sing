    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Before the throne of God above
I have a strong, a perfect plea;
A great High Priest, whose Name is Love,
Who ever lives and pleads for me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">My name is graven on His hands,
My name is written on His heart;
I know that while with God He stands
No tongue can bid me thence depart.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">When Satan tempts me to despair,
And tells me of the guilt within,
Upward I look, and see Him there
Who made an end of all my sin.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Because the sinless Savior died,
My sinful soul is counted free;
For God, the Just, is satisfied
To look on Him and pardon me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Behold Him there, the risen Lamb!
My perfect, spotless Righteousness,
The great unchangeable I AM,
The King of glory and of grace.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">One with Himself, I cannot die;
My soul is purchased by His blood;
My life is hid with Christ on high,
With Christ, my Savior and my God.</stanza>
