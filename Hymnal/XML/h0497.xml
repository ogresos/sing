	<stanza type="verse" number="1">Grace in its highest definition is
God in the Son to be enjoyed by us;
It is not only something done or giv'n,
But God Himself, our portion glorious.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">God is incarnate in the flesh that we
Him may receive, experience ourself;
This is the grace which we receive of God,
Which comes thru Christ and which is Christ Himself.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">Paul the Apostle counted all as dung,
'Twas only God in Christ he counted grace;
'Tis by this grace&amp;mdash;the Lord experienced&amp;mdash;
That he surpassed the others in the race.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">It is this grace&amp;mdash;Christ as our inward strength&amp;mdash;
Which with His all-sufficiency doth fill;
It is this grace which in our spirit is,
There energizing, working out God's will.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">This grace, which is the living Christ Himself,
Is what we need and must experience;
Lord, may we know this grace and by it live,
Thyself increasingly as grace to sense.</stanza>
