    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Ye who are troubled and burdened by sin,
  Come just as you are;
Come to the Savior, a new life begin,
  Oh, come just as you are.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Come just as you are,
  Oh, come just as you are;
Give up your sin, let the Savior come in,
    And come just as you are.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Deep in your heart sin has written its scar,
  Come just as you are;
Though from the Father you've wandered afar,
  Oh, come just as you are.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Sinful and guilty, heart broken and lost,
  Come just as you are;
Think what your ransom on Calvary cost!
  Oh, come just as you are.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Naught of your goodness God's favor can win,
  Come just as you are;
Trust in the blood which was shed for your sin,
  And come just as you are.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Come with your heartache, your sorrow and pain,
  Come just as you are;
No one has come to the Savior in vain,
  Oh, come just as you are.</stanza>
