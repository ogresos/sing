  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Christ calling yet! shall I not hear?
Earth's pleasures shall I still hold dear?
Shall life's swift passing years all fly,
And still my soul in slumber lie?</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Calling yet, oh, hear Him!
Calling yet, oh, hear Him!
Christ is calling yet;
Oh! hear Him calling, calling!
Calling yet, oh, hear Him!
Calling yet, oh, hear Him!
Christ is calling yet; oh, hear
    Him calling yet!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Christ calling yet! shall I not rise?
Can I His loving voice despise,
And basely His kind care repay?
He calls me still; can I delay?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Christ calling yet! and shall He knock,
And I my heart the closer lock?
He still is waiting to receive;
And shall I dare His Spirit grieve?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Christ calling yet! and shall I give
No heed, but still in bondage live?
I wait, but He does not forsake:
He calls me still; my heart, awake!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Christ calling yet! I cannot stay;
My heart I yield without delay;
Vain world, farewell! from thee I part;
The voice of Christ has reached my heart.</stanza>
