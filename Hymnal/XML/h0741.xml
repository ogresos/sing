  <lyrics>
	<stanza type="verse" number="1">God ordained us unto sonship,
  Ere creation's work was done,
To conform us by His Spirit
  To the image of His Son;
That His only dear Begotten
  Might become the firstborn One,
And by Him with many brethren
  His expression full be won.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">By divine regeneration
  We the sons of God became,
But we must mature to fullness,
  Thus the birthright to obtain.
Born and fully grown to manhood,
  God's adoption we may share;
By the measure of full stature,
  We God's sonship will declare.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">All our spirit, soul and body
  Unto Christ conformed must be;
This will be accomplished fully
  When our glorious Lord we see.
By our body's full redemption
  Shall adoption be complete;
By the final transformation
  All God's purpose we shall meet.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">By that final transformation,
  We'll be fully sanctified;
God will bring us into glory,
  With His Son identified.
All creation is expecting
  Sons of God revealed to be,
That they might be freed from bondage
  Into glorious liberty.</stanza>
