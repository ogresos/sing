    <stanza type="verse" number="1">There's a little word that the Lord has giv'n
  For our help in the hour of need:
Let us reckon ourselves to be dead to sin,
  To be dead and dead indeed.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Let us reckon, reckon, reckon,
Let us reckon, rather than feel;
Let us be true to the reck'ning,
    And He will make it real.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">There's another word that the Lord has giv'n,
  In the very same verse we read,
Let us reckon ourselves as alive in Him,
  As alive and alive indeed.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">While we trust in feeling or inward frames
  We shall always be tossed about,
Let us anchor fast to the Word of God,
  And reckon away our doubt.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">As the mariner, when the skies are dim.
  Sails on by his compass true;
So our faith would cling to the promise firm.
  And reckon the journey through.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">O how sweet it is to be anchored fast
  To a hope that can never fail;
Let us reckon on with a firmer trust,
  Till we anchor within the veil.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">You may claim the promise from every pain,
  You may know His power to heal;
But your faith must rest in His word alone,
  And reckon, rather than feel.</stanza>
