    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Do you know that you were chosen
Long before the world began
That by God you were selected
And appointed for His plan?
Something in your inmost being
Tells you this is surely true;
That's why you are in this meeting,
And you feel the way you do.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">All the sins you've e'er committed,
Everything you've ever done,
All by God has been forgiven
Taken care of by God's Son.
Struggle not, no; just believe this,
For His word assures it's true;
All you need to do is thank Him
For all that He's done for you.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Did you know that all the Bible
Is a will, a testament?
Everything that Christ accomplished
Is for all God's children meant.
As His child you are included,
For His word stands fast and true;
So by faith you now inherit
All that He has done for you.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Did you know God has a family?
Yes, He does, in fact, it's us.
That's why we are here enjoying
All He is, so marvelous.
He's our God and we're His people,
Day by day we love Him more;
We're so happy and so thankful,
We just praise Him o'er and o'er.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">All we know is that we love Him,
We're so glad for what He's done;
We are brought to Him, and we all
Know the joy of being one.
We're so glad that we're included,
What a fellowship have we!
So we'd like to welcome you, friend,
Into God's own family.</stanza>
