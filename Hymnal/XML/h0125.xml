	<stanza type="verse" number="1">Hallelujah! sing to Jesus,
  His the scepter, His the throne;
Hallelujah! His the triumph,
  His the victory alone.
Hark, the songs of His redeemed ones
  Thunder like a mighty flood:
Jesus out of every nation
  Hath redeemed us by His blood.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">Hallelujah! not as orphans
  Are we left in sorrow now;
Hallelujah! He is near us,
  Faith believes, nor questions how.
Though the clouds from sight received Him
  When the forty days were o'er,
Shall our hearts forget His promise,
  "I am with you evermore"?</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">Hallelujah! Bread of heaven,
  Thou on earth our food, our stay;
Hallelujah! here the hungry
  Come to Thee from day to day.
Advocate and Intercessor,
  My Redeemer pleads for me,
On the throne of the Almighty
  Now and to eternity.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">Hallelujah! sing to Jesus,
  His the scepter, His the throne;
Hallelujah! His the triumph,
  His the victory alone.
Hark, the songs of His redeemed ones
  Thunder like a mighty flood:
Jesus out of every nation,
  Hath redeemed us by His blood.</stanza>
