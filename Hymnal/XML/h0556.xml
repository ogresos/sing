  <lyrics>
	<stanza type="verse" number="1">Thy name is sweet as ointment poured forth;
Better Thy love than wine, O draw Thou me!
If we the footsteps follow of the flock,
Entered Thy fellowship of love we'll be.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">He's my Beloved, I am His own love;
He draweth me, pursue I after Him.
Fragrant as myrrh, I'd hide Him in my heart;
Beauteous as henna*, I'd be clothed with Him;</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">Bathe in His love, and of His fatness taste,
Lie on His breast, His sweetness there enjoy;
His love the banner, His affection shown
Tenderly soothes my heart to purest joy.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">Oh, my Beloved's mine, and I am His;
I am a lily and my Shepherd He;
May daybreak come, the shadows flee away,
Him on the mountains as a hart I'd see.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">Myrrh of the death with Him and frankincense,
The resurrection, permeate my heart;
North wind awake, and let the south wind blow,
Make my heart's garden pleasure to His heart.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">I'd be to Him a dove that's undefiled,
As a pure lily in His presence be,
His, wholly His, the joy of all His joys,
He wholly mine, the Song of songs to me.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">Fair as the moon, conformed to Him I'd be,
Clear as the sun, unto His stature grown;
For my Beloved, all to please His heart,
For my Beloved, that His life be shown.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="8">Thou art my life, and I Thine image real;
Love in such union is as death most strong,
Ne'er can it be destroyed or e'er replaced
Till Thou on spices mountains come ere long.</stanza>
	<stanza type="note" number="">Old World plant, prized for its fragrant yellow and white flowers. (Song of Sol. 1:14, A.S.V.)</stanza>
