    <stanza type="verse" number="1">His banner over me is love,
His banner over me is love;
He brought me into His banqueting house,
And His banner over me is love.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Is love! Is love!
His banner over me is love;
He brought me into His banqueting house,
  And His banner over me is love.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">His fruit is sweet unto my taste,
His fruit is sweet unto my taste;
I'm feasting here in His banqueting house,
And His fruit is sweet unto my taste.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">How sweet! How sweet!
His fruit is sweet unto my taste;
I'm feasting here in His banqueting house,
  And His fruit is sweet unto my taste.</stanza>
