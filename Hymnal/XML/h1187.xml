    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Your ministry, O Lord,
  How excellent it is;
A better covenant,
  And better promises;
Enacted on a better law.
Of such You are Executor.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">A better covenant,
  And better promises;
A better law of life
  And sacrifice this is.
Redemption's work, done long ago,
A better blood has made it so.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">In Hebrews eight we see
  The way to make us whole;
Life planted deep within,
  Which spreads into the soul.
The law of life, imparted, still
Inscribed in mind, emotion, will.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">The law of letters leave,
  The law of life pursue;
The one is old and dead,
  The other fresh and new.
Dead teachings cannot help the seed;
The law of life is what we need.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">The law of life in us,
  In function now we see,
Works not by will and thought
  But automatically.
It saturates, conforms to Him;
The standard model spreads within.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Our sins are all forgiv'n,
  His life imparted too;
God is our God today,
  And we're His people true.
We know Him in an inward way:
These blessings four have come to stay.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">We're being sonized now;
  The life within will do
The deep transforming work
  Of making us anew.
In ages past, the work was done&amp;mdash;
Now prayer is over&amp;mdash;praise the Son!</stanza>
