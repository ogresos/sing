    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Behold the Lamb with glory crowned,
  To Him all pow'r is giv'n:
No place too high for Him is found,
  No place too high in heav'n.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">He fills the throne&amp;mdash;the throne above;
  Its rights to Him belong;
The object of His Father's love,
  Theme of the ransomed's song.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Though high yet He accepts the praise
  His people offer here;
The faintest, feeblest note they raise
  Will reach the Savior's ear.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">This song be ours, we join in one
  To celebrate the Name
Of Him that sits upon the throne,
  And to exalt the Lamb.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">To Him whom men despise and slight,
  To Him be glory giv'n;
The crown is His, and His by right
  The highest place in heav'n.</stanza>
