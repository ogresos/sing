  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">He's the vine and we're the branches,
We should e'er abide in Him,
And let Him abide within us
As the flow of life within.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">In the vine, in the vine,
In the vine, in the vine,
We would know Thee, Lord,
  more deeply,
  E'er abiding in the vine.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">As we hear His instant speaking,
He's the rich indwelling Word;
To abide we must be faithful
To the speaking that we've heard.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">For 'tis here we know abiding
In the real and deepest way;
If we love our Lord completely,
We would do whate'er He'd say.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Then His love abides within us,
And in love abiding, we
Know the joy of life-communion,
Full and perfect harmony.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Oh, how precious this abiding,
Oh, how intimate and sweet;
As the fruit of life is added,
And our joy is made complete.</stanza>
