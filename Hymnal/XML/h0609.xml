	<stanza type="verse" number="1">I praise Thee for Thy mystery,
That I may truly contact Thee;
In unapproachable light Thou wast
But now as Spirit nigh to me.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">The Father, Son, and Spirit, Thou,
The triune God, my life fore'er;
In me Thou art the full supply
That I Thy holy nature share.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">The triune God the Spirit is,
And comes as breath and wind to me;
'Tis thus I may experience
The Godhead's wondrous mystery.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">All that the Father is and has
In His beloved Son doth rest,
And all the riches of the Son
Are by the Spirit now possessed.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">The Spirit doth descend on me
And to my spirit enters in,
That He, the Father in the Son,
My blessed portion be within.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">The Father is the fountainhead,
The Son expression gives to Him;
The Spirit is His very flow,
As my reality within.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">The Father in the Son has come
That God to man Himself may show;
The Son as Spirit enters me
That God I inwardly may know.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="8">The Father purposed that the Son
Should be the first in everything;
The Son the Father takes as Head
And over all His headship brings.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="9">The Spirit perfectly desires
That Christ, the Son, be glorified,
And He reveals Him unto me,
That He be fully testified.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="10">Thy final form the Spirit is,
Our worship to receive within;
If I Thy riches would enjoy,
In spirit I must contact Him.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="11">If I in spirit worship Thee,
In spirit live, in spirit pray,
The Holy Spirit I will touch
And Thee enjoy in every way.</stanza>
