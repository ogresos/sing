  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">O for a thousand tongues to sing
  My great Redeemer's praise,
The glories of my God and King,
  The triumphs of His grace.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">My gracious Master and my God,
  Assist me to proclaim,
To spread through all the earth abroad,
  The honors of Thy name.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Jesus! the name that charms our fears,
  That bids our sorrows cease;
'Tis music in the sinner's ears,
  'Tis life, and health, and peace.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">His love my heart has captive made,
  His captive would I be,
For He was bound, and scourged and died,
  My captive soul to free.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">He breaks the power of canceled sin,
  He sets the prisoner free;
His blood can make the foulest clean;
  His blood availed for me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">So now Thy blessed Name I love,
  Thy will would e'er be mine.
Had I a thousand hearts to give,
  My Lord, they all were Thine!</stanza>
