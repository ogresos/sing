    <stanza type="verse" number="1">In loving-kindness Jesus came
  My soul in mercy to reclaim,
And from the depths of sin and shame
  Through grace He lifted me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">From sinking sand He lifted me,
With tender hand He lifted me,
From shades of night to plains of light,
  Oh, praise His name, He lifted me!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">He called me long before I heard,
  Before my sinful heart was stirred,
But when I took Him at His word,
  Forgiv'n, He lifted me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">His brow was pierced with many a thorn,
  His hands by cruel nails were torn,
When from my guilt and grief, forlorn,
  In love He lifted me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Now on a higher plane I dwell,
  And with my soul I know 'tis well;
Yet how or why, I cannot tell,
  He should have lifted me.</stanza>
