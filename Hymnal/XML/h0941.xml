  <lyrics>
	<stanza type="verse" number="1">God's kingdom is God's reigning,
  His glory to maintain;
It is His sovereign ruling,
  His order to sustain.
He exercises fully
  His own authority
Within His kingdom ever
  And to eternity.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">Upon the throne, the center
  Of government divine,
God reigns, and with His purpose
  Brings everything in line.
God's headship and His lordship
  He only can maintain
As King within His kingdom,
  O'er everything to reign.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">By reigning in His kingdom
  God worketh all His will,
And under His dominion
  His purpose doth fulfill.
'Tis only in God's kingdom
  His blessing we may know;
'Tis from His throne almighty
  The stream of life doth flow.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">Submitted to God's ruling,
  All virtue thus will win;
Rebellion to His Headship
  Is but the root of sin.
The evil aim of Satan&amp;mdash;
  God's throne to overthrow;
Our aim and goal is ever
  His rule to fully know.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">Within God's sovereign kingdom
  His Christ is magnified;
When Christ in life is reigning,
  The Father's glorified.
When God is in dominion,
  All things are truly blessed;
When Christ for God is reigning.
  God's glory is expressed.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">In fulness of the seasons
  God's Christ will head up all.
Then all will own His reigning
  And worship, great and small.
Such reign in life and glory
  The Church e'en now foretastes
And to His rule submitting
  Unto His kingdom hastes.</stanza>
