  <lyrics>
	<stanza type="verse" number="1">Christ is God's centrality
And His universality;
He is God's delight and joy
Throughout all eternity.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">He's th' embodiment of God,
In Him all God's fulness dwells;
His unique supremacy
And His Godhead none excels.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">All God's purpose is for Him,
That He might be all in all;
All the things in heav'n and earth
With Himself are made withal.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">All creation is for Christ,
Everything was made by Him;
'Tis by Him all things subsist,
He's the hub and He's the rim.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">In redemption He is all,
All through Him is reconciled;
By His blood all things with God
Now in peace are domiciled.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">He the great beginning is,
And the Church's living Head;
He her life and content too,
And the firstborn from the dead.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">In God's Kingdom He's the King,
All the pow'r to Him is giv'n;
In His glory He shall rule
Over all in earth and heav'n.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="8">In new heaven and new earth
Center of all things He'll be,
For the Godhead and for man
Throughout all eternity.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="9">God intends in everything
Christ should have preeminence,
And that such a Christ of all
We should now experience.</stanza>
