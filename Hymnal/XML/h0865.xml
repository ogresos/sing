	<stanza type="verse" number="1">In spirit and in truth, O Lord,
  We meet to worship here;
As taught by Christ, the Son of God,
  We now in Him draw near.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">Thank God, He is a Spirit true,
  So near, so dear to us;
That we may contact Him in life,
  In truth to worship thus.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">A spirit God has made for us
  That we may worship Him,
Not striving, serving outwardly,
  But seeking from within.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">Regenerated by the Lord,
  Renewed in mind and heart,
He dwells within us as our life
  True worship to impart.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">We worship here according to
  The inner consciousness,
Anointed by His Spirit now
  His fulness we express.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">In truth we serve and worship too,
  In shadows nevermore,
In Christ, the one reality,
  The Father we adore.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">To God we offer Christ the Lord
  Whom we experience;
With God we too delight in Him.
  His light and sweetness sense.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="8">In spirit and reality
  Together here we meet,
To worship, praise, and fellowship
  Around the mercy-seat.</stanza>
