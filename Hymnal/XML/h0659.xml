Oh, let His mer -- cy cheer; He sun -- ders the bands that en -- thrall; Re -- deemed by His blood, why should we ev -- er fear, Since Je -- sus is our all in all? If God be for us, if God be for us, if God be for us, Who can be a -- gainst us? Who? who? who? Who can be a -- gainst us, a -- gainst us?</singingstanza>

    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Rejoice in the Lord! Oh, let His mercy cheer;
  He sunders the bands that enthrall;
Redeemed by His blood, why should we ever fear,
  Since Jesus is our all in all?</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">If God be for us, if God be for us,
  if God be for us,
Who can be against us?
Who? who? who?
  Who can be against us, against us?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Be strong in the Lord! rejoicing in His might,
  Be loyal and true day by day;
When evils assail, be valiant for the right,
  And He will be our strength and stay.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Confide in His Word, His promises so sure;
  In Christ they are yea and amen;
Though earth pass away, they ever shall endure,
  'Tis written o'er and o'er again.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Abide in the Lord, secure in His control,
  'Tis life everlasting begun;
To pluck from His hand the weakest, trembling soul,
  It never, never can be done!</stanza>
