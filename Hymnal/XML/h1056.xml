    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Jesus, my Lord, to Thee I cry;
Unless Thou save me, I must die:
Oh, bring Thy free salvation nigh,
  And take me as I am!</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">And take me as I am!
  And take me as I am!
My only plea&amp;mdash;Christ died for me!
    Oh, take me as I am!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Helpless I am, and full of guilt;
But yet for me Thy blood was spilt,
And Thou canst make me what Thou wilt,
  And take me as I am.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">No preparation can I make,
My best resolves I only break,
Yet save me for Thine own Name's sake,
  And take me as I am.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Behold me, Savior, at Thy feet,
Deal with me as Thou seest meet;
Thy work begin, Thy work complete,
  But take me as I am.</stanza>
