    <stanza type="verse" number="1">'Midst the darkness, storm, and sorrow,
  One bright gleam I see;
Well I know the blessed morrow
  Christ will come for me.
'Midst the peace, the joy, the glory
  And the light, God's own,
Christ for me is watching, waiting,
  Waiting 'til I come.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Long the blessed Guide has led me,
  By the desert road;
Now I see the coming splendor,
  Splendor of my God.
There amidst the love and glory
  He is waiting yet;
On His hands a name is graven
  He can ne'er forget.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Who is this, who comes to meet me,
  On the desert way,
As the Morning Star foretelling
  God's unclouded day?
He it is who came to win me,
  On the cross of shame;
In His glory well I know Him,
  Evermore the same.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">O the blessed joy of meeting,
  All the desert past;
O the wondrous words of greeting,
  He shall speak at last!
He and I together ent'ring
  The fair realm above;
He and I together sharing
  All the Father's love.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Where no shade nor stain can enter,
  Nor the gold be dim,
In His holiness unsullied,
  I shall walk with Him.
Meet companion then for Jesus,
  From Him, for Him, made&amp;mdash;
Glory of God's grace forever
  There in me displayed.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">He who in His hour of sorrow
  Bore the curse alone;
I who through the lonely desert
  Trod where He had gone;
He and I, in that bright glory,
  One deep joy shall share&amp;mdash;
Mine, to be forever with Him;
  His, that I am there.</stanza>
