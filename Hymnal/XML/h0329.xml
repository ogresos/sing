    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Blessed be God, our God,
Who gave for us His well-beloved Son,
    The gift of gifts, all other gifts in one;
Blessed be God, our God!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">What will He not bestow!
Who freely gave this mighty gift unbought,
    Unmerited, unheeded, and unsought,
What will He not bestow?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">He spared not His Son!
'Tis this that silences each rising fear,
    'Tis this that bids the hard thought disappear;
He spared not His Son!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Who shall condemn us now?
Since Christ has died, and ris'n, and gone above,
    For us to plead at the right hand of Love;
Who shall condemn us now?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">'Tis God that justifies!
Who shall recall His pardon or His grace?
    Or who the broken chain of guilt replace?
'Tis God that justifies!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">The victory is ours!
For us in might came forth the mighty One;
    For us He fought the fight, the triumph won:
The victory is ours!</stanza>
