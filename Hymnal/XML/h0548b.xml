  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Earthen vessel I was made,
Christ in me the treasure laid;
His container I must be,
As the content He in me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">In His image I was made,
Fit that Christ should all pervade;
Thus the vessel God did form
With the content uniform.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">In my spirit He remains,
With His power He sustains;
As the Spirit one with me,
He is my reality.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Moving in me day by day,
Mingling with me all the way,
All my steps He regulates,
Every part He saturates.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Him expressing from within,
Making Him to others seen,
I transparent have to be
That He may be shown thru me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Transformation is my need,
To be broken more indeed,
That the clay may change in form,
To the treasure to conform.</stanza>
