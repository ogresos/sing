    <stanza type="verse" number="1">What great provision God has made
  In Jesus' death on Calvary!
  I hung with Him upon the tree,
And in His tomb I too was laid.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">I rose with Him from out the grave&amp;mdash;
  And how shall I who died to sin
  Continue still to live therein,
The victor living as the slave?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">At God's right hand He took His place,
  And while for saints my Savior pleads,
  My heart for sinners intercedes
That they might know His saving grace.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Oh, what a name to me is given&amp;mdash;
  A son of God, by second birth!
  I represent Him on the earth,
He represents me now in heaven.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">As Jesus dwells beyond the skies,
  I dwell within this world of strife;
  And as He lives within my life,
In Him I'm in the heavenlies!</stanza>
