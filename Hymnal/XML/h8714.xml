    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Do come to Jesus now;
  Jesus is here.
Don't follow death below;
  Jesus is here.
Draw near while still you may;
Come while there is today.
What reason to delay?
  Jesus is here.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Do come to Jesus now;
  Jesus is here.
Nor drift, sure loss allow;
  Jesus is here.
The Savior's favor gain;
Break now from Satan's chain;
Love not this world again.
  Jesus is here.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Do come to Jesus now;
  Jesus is here.
Nor doubt nor wonder how;
  Jesus is here.
Though great your sins may be,
He loves you fervently.
Leave your anxiety;
  Jesus is here.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Do come to Jesus now;
  Jesus is here.
To His dominion bow;
  Jesus is here.
Redemption's work is done;
He is your hope alone;
Unto His welcome run.
  Jesus is here.</stanza>
