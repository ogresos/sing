    <stanza type="verse" number="1">The universe of God consists
  Of heaven, earth, and air.
The enemy of God resists
  His purpose everywhere.
At first the mighty rebel one
  The earth from God obtained;
Then from the Lord the air had won,
  Establishing his reign.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">So God's intention was to gain
  His kingdom on the earth,
The place where He could fully reign
  And show to all His worth.
Thus He began in Genesis
  To forward His great plan.
Out of this darkened, lost abyss
  Our God created man.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">But Satan caused the man to fall
  From God's eternal grace.
Then Abraham received the call
  To head the chosen race.
The Jews were led from Pharaoh's hand
  Through sea and wilderness
Into the promised Canaan land,
  God's kingdom to express.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">The Israelites refused God's reign,
  Desired an earthly king;
The kingdom then was lost again
  Till David was to bring
God's kingdom back to earth once more
  For God to rule through him;
But Israel failed as once before
  God's kingdom to bring in.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Such was the situation when
  Our God became a man,
Declaring to all men,"Repent!
  The kingdom is at hand."
A perfect model of God's rule,
  The King, full qualified!
But Satan as a desperate fool
  Had Jesus crucified.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">This Jesus went into the grave
  And death He overcame.
Now resurrected He will save
  The earth from Satan's reign.
He as the Spirit enters man
  To fill him with His life.
These men, the church, fulfill His plan
  To save the earth from strife.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Now on the earth the church we see,
  God's kingdom here expressed,
Where He has full authority
  His rule to manifest.
The place where Satan has to flee
  Our mighty conquering rod,
The kingdom through the church will be
  Brought to the earth for God.</stanza>
