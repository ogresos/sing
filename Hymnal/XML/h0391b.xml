  <notes>The author, William Williams preached and sang throughout Wales. "He sang Wales into Piety". He was the poet laureate of the Welsch revival. Soon all Wales was singing their way to the coal mines and soccer matches. And their favorite hymn was this marching song by one of their own. ("Great Songs of Faith" by Brown &amp; Norton)</notes>
  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Guide me, O Thou gracious Savior,
Pilgrim through this barren land;
I am weak, but Thou art mighty,
Hold me with Thy pow'rful hand;
Bread of heaven, Bread of heaven,
Feed me till I want no more;
Feed me till I want no more.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Open now the crystal fountain,
Whence the healing waters flow;
Let the fiery, cloudy pillar
Lead me all my journey through;
Strong Deliv'rer, strong Deliv'rer,
Be Thou still my strength and shield;
Be Thou still my strength and shield.</stanza>
