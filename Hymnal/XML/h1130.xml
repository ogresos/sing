  <lyrics>
	<stanza type="verse" number="1">Sing praise to Christ Who lives in us,
The God of our salvation;
Who saves us by His life divine,
And not by regulation;
After we've worked&amp;mdash;done all we can,
His life has power to change a man:
His life divine can change us.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">He saves us to the uttermost
By His life-giving power;
Transfusing Himself into us,
He saves us hour by hour.
He saved the lost by coming in,
He's saving now from more than sin:
He's saving us to glory!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">Our Lord was constituted priest
To be a real life-giver;
Life is the nature of this One
Who can from self deliver:
His life is indestructible,
By it He saves us to the full:
Praise God, He's fully able!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">His life is fully qualified
To bring us through to glory;
Were it not for His tested life,
'Twould be another story
His life was fully tried on earth,
To crucifixion from His birth:
He passed through death and Hades.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">He's pledged to save us to the full,
His life is operating;
He's doing everything for us
'Tis all for our perfecting;
Our life's a failure at its best,
Only His life can stand the test:
His life brings full salvation!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">He's living now to intercede,
Continuing forever;
He undertakes into the age,
His priesthood changes never;
He always lives to intercede,
Such a High Priest is what we need:
He's higher than the heavens.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">Come forward now to God through Him,
Ne'er shrink back to destruction;
Come forward now to get the life,
Which brings the proper function;
Come forward now the life to take,
By life His people us He'll make,
And swallow death forever.</stanza>
