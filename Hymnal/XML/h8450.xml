  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">The proper story of God and man is
All in the Spirit's realm;
Man must in spirit touch God the Spirit
To experience Him.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">My spirit's Spirit-born,
Spirit-filled,
Spirit worshipping,
Till Spirit-Word, with abundant life,
Flows as a river from me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">First God the Spirit made man a spirit,
To worship Him thereby,
Enabling man to gain God as life,
And God to be man's supply.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">God came as Spirit into man's spirit,
Regenerating him;
In spirit man can enjoy God's riches,
Fellowshipping with Him.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Now God the Spirit infills, infuses,
Thus I'm transformed, renewed;
Till from my spirit to my whole being,
I am soaked through and through.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">With God the Spirit I'm joined and mingled,
Transformed to like Him be;
His element's added more and more
Till His expression is seen.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">As all God's riches are in the Spirit
For our experience,
I must in spirit each moment breathe Him,
To enjoy all He is.</stanza>
