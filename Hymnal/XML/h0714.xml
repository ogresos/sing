    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Through all the changing scenes of life,
  In trouble and in joy,
The praises of my God shall still
  My heart and tongue employ.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Oh, magnify the Lord with me,
  With me exalt His name;
When in distress to Him I called,
  He to my rescue came.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">The hosts of God encamp around
  The dwellings of the just;
Deliverance He affords to all
  Who on His succor trust.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Oh, make but trial of His love,
  Experience will decide
How blest they are, and only they,
  Who in His truth confide.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Fear Him, ye saints, and you will then
  Have nothing else to fear;
Make you His service your delight,
  Your wants shall be His care.</stanza>
