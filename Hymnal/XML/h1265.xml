    <stanza type="verse" number="1">The churches are the Body
Of Christ on earth today.
They are His testimony,
That He may have a way.
They are the golden lampstands
In cities far and wide.
They are His fighting army,
And His beloved Bride.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">The churches, the churches,
Upon the earth today;
Lord, stir our hearts for Thy desire,
And build us, oh, build us,
Lord, we pray.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Oh, how we need the churches,
All of them, great or small!
We need their many portions
To profit us withal.
Yes, Lord, enlarge the churches;
We love their needs to bear.
Enlarge our hearts, Lord Jesus,
In fellowship and prayer.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">The Lord's eyes o'er the whole earth
Are running to and fro;
Those seven, burning, searching,
Our heart's desire to know.
His purpose&amp;mdash;many churches,
Built up in one accord;
This golden testimony
Will thus express the Lord.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">And soon will be the coming
Of our triumphant King!
He's coming for the churches
Where His sweet praises ring.
Come, Lord, come reap the firstfruits,
As draws the harvest nigh,
And to Thy throne do take us,
To reign with Thee on high.</stanza>
