    <stanza type="verse" number="1">I will sing the wondrous story
  Of the Christ who died for me,
How He left His home in glory
  For the cross of Calvary.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Yes, I'll sing the wondrous story
  Of the Christ who died for me,
Sing it in the light of glory,
    Sing it through eternity.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">I was lost, but Jesus found me,
  Found the sheep that went astray,
Threw His loving arms around me,
  Drew me back into His way.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">I was bruised, but Jesus healed me;
  Faint was I from many a fall;
Sight was gone, and fears possessed me,
  But He freed me from them all.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Days of darkness still come o'er me,
  Sorrow's paths I often tread,
But the Savior still is with me;
  By His hand I'm safely led.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">He will keep me till the rapture,
  Day by day He'll wash my feet,
And will transform all my nature
  That in glory we may meet.</stanza>
