  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">The Savior can lift every burden,
  The heavy as well as the light;
His strength is made perfect in weakness,
  In Him there is power and might.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">The Savior can solve every problem,
The tangles of life can undo;
There is nothing too hard for Jesus,
  There is nothing that He cannot do.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">The Savior can bear every sorrow,
  In Him there is comfort and rest;
No matter how great the affliction,
  He only permits what is best.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">The Savior can strengthen the weary,
  His grace is sufficient for all;
He knows every step of the pathway
  And listens to hear when we call.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">The Savior can break sin's dominion,
  The vict'ry He won long ago;
In Him there is freedom from bondage,
  He's able to conquer the foe.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">The Savior can satisfy fully
  The heart that the world cannot fill;
His Spirit will sanctify wholly
  The soul that is yielded and still.</stanza>
