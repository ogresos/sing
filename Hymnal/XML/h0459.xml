    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Not to ourselves again,
  Not to the flesh we live;
Not to the world henceforth shall we
  Our strength, our being give.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">The time past of our lives
  Sufficeth to have wrought
The fleshly will, which only ill
  Hath to us ever brought.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">No longer is our life
  A thing unused or vain;
To us e'en here to live is Christ,
  To us to die is gain.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Our life is hid with Christ,
  With Christ in God above,
Upward our heart would go to Him,
  Whom, seeing not, we love.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">He liveth, and we live!
  His life for us prevails;
His fulness fills our mighty void,
  His strength for us avails.</stanza>
