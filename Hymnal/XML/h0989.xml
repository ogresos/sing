  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Jesus, my Savior, to Bethlehem came,
Laid in a manger to sorrow and shame;
O it was wonderful, blest be His name,
  Seeking for me, for me:
  Seeking for me, for me,
  Seeking for me, for me;
O it was wonderful, blest be His name,
  Seeking for me, for me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Jesus, my Savior, on Calvary's tree
Paid the great debt, and my soul He set free;
O it was wonderful&amp;mdash;how could it be?
  Dying for me, for me!
  Dying for me, for me,
  Dying for me, for me;
O it was wonderful&amp;mdash;how could it be?
  Dying for me, for me!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Jesus, my Savior, the same as of old,
While I was wand'ring in darkness and cold,
Gently and long did He plead with my soul,
  Calling for me, for me!
  Calling for me, for me,
  Calling for me, for me;
Gently and long did He plead with my soul,
  Calling for me, for me!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Jesus, my Savior, shall come from on high.
Sweet is the promise as weary years fly:
O I shall see Him descend from the sky,
  Coming for me, for me!
  Coming for me, for me,
  Coming for me, for me;
O I shall see Him descend from the sky,
  Coming for me, for me!</stanza>
