    <stanza type="verse" number="1">He healeth me, oh, bless His name!
I want to spread abroad His fame;
From dread disease He sets me free,
The Lord my healer, strong is He!</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">He healeth me, He healeth me!
By power divine He healeth me;
He healed the sick in Galilee,
  And now by faith He healeth me!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">He healeth me! my simple faith
Believes the word that Jesus saith,
And takes the place of ardent hope,
Believes the Lord will raise me up.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">He healeth me! I touch for cure
The border of His garment pure,
And virtue through my being flows,
A healing balm for nature's woes.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">He healeth me, as when of yore,
Their sins and sicknesses He bore;
Nor has He lost His power and skill&amp;mdash;
Our blessed Christ is living still.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">He healeth me! how oft I sought
This healing power, but found it not:
But now I trust with all my soul,
And now through faith He makes me whole.</stanza>
