    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Praise God for tidings glad&amp;mdash;
  We're at the throne of grace;
  Our gospel's not so low,
  We're in the highest place.
We're meeting here around the throne,
Enjoying God with all His own.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Start in the outer court,
  But aim to get inside;
  The Holy Place is good,
  But do not there abide.
Leave sin behind&amp;mdash;it's put away;
We're in the veil with God to stay.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">To rise from earth to heav'n,
  A deeper turn we need;
  To be where Christ is now
  Upon the throne indeed.
We're gathered at the throne of grace,
Beholding Jesus face to face.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">We're being turned as one,
  Not individually;
  Not private Christians now,
  But Body Christians we.
As members here in one accord,
We are the Body of the Lord.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">As Body Christians now
  We have a higher word.
  Foundation's word we see,
  'Tis altar, cross, and blood.
Perfection's word is little known,
'Tis fellowship around the throne.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Christ is objective too,
  But subjective are we
  In our experience;
  Our spirit is the key.
God, throne, and holiest&amp;mdash;we see
Our spirit now contains all three.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Leviticus is past,
  And Aaron's work is o'er;
  Melchisedec is here,
  High Priest forevermore;
His ministry is now so fine:
He comes to feed us bread and wine.</stanza>
    <stanza type="note" number="">(Repeat the last line of each stanza)</stanza>
