	<stanza type="verse" number="1">God's Kingdom on the earth is now
His sovereign government within;
'Tis Christ Himself in us to live
As Lord and King to rule and reign.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">His life with His authority
Enthrones Him now within our hearts
To govern all our words and deeds
And regulate our inward parts.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">The Lord enthroned within our hearts
His Kingdom doth establish there,
Assuring His full right to reign
And for God's purpose to prepare.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">'Tis by His reign within our hearts
That life to us He e'er supplies;
When taking Him as Lord and King,
His wealth our being satisfies.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">'Tis by His ruling from within
His fulness vast is testified;
'Tis when His inner kingdom rules
His Body's blessed and edified.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">'Tis by His heav'nly rule within
As heav'nly citizens we live;
'Tis by submission to His rule
Expression of His reign we give.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">Here in this heav'nly realm we live,
And with this heav'nly pow'r possessed
We walk and fight in heav'nly light
Until the Kingdom's manifest.</stanza>
