	<stanza type="verse" number="1">O how blessed is the priest's life,
  Christ to him is all in all:
All His clothing, food, and dwelling,
  And His portion therewithal.</stanza>
	<stanza type="chorus" number="">O how blessed is the priest's life,
  Christ to him is all in all:
All his clothing, food, and dwelling,
    And his portion therewithal.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">All the clothing of his service
  Is the beauty of the Lord;
Glorious splendor do his garments,
  Breast and shoulder-piece afford.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">When in sacrifice he offers
  Christ to God as God has willed,
Then as food he doth enjoy Him
  And is with His riches filled.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">Putting on the Lord as clothing,
  Christ without he doth express;
Eating, drinking, with Him mingled,
  Christ within doth him possess.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">Holy, glorious is their dwelling,
  'Tis the increase of the Lord;
Here the priests built up together
  Unto God a house afford.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">All his portion, all his living,
  Everything the priests possess&amp;mdash;
All is Christ and Christ forever,
  In His all-inclusiveness.</stanza>
