  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Our goal&amp;mdash;the holy city with the Lord,
It is our portion, 'tis where He's adored;
Although our bodies still are living here,
Our spirits with our glorious Lord are there;
Our spirits with our glorious Lord are there.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Our goal divine&amp;mdash;the new Jerusalem&amp;mdash;
That holy city made for God with men;
For all redeemed, who have Thy pathway trod,
Shall have the right to share the bliss with God,
Shall have the right to share the bliss with God.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">And every time we toward that city gaze,
Then every time we long to see Thy face;
We long to hear the shout that calls to Thee,
With Thee to share Thy God eternally,
With Thee to share Thy God eternally.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Our heart's desire is not the peace so sweet,
Our longed for hope is not the joy we'll meet;
But Thou Thyself, Thou art "our hope," O Lord,
For 'tis Thyself that will be our reward,
For 'tis Thyself that will be our reward.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">O Jesus, Lord, we pray Thee hear our cry,
Come! Bring us to that city from on high!
That in that glory we may share with Thee,
Thy loving Self partake eternally,
Thy loving Self partake eternally.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">O Lord, Thou sayest, "I make all things new,"
New heav'ns, new earth, and all within them too!
Our God Himself our portion then shall be;
O Lord, come quickly! Take us up with Thee,
O Lord, come quickly! Take us up with Thee.</stanza>
