	<singingstanza>O home in the church, Where we've end -- ed our search With the broth -- ers re -- joic -- ing all day; Where Christ is our life, And we're through with all strife, Now we're home, hal -- le -- lu -- jah, to stay! Home, home in the church; Yes, it's here that we've end -- ed our search; And through all our days We will shout to His praise, "Hal -- le -- lu -- jah for Christ and the church!"</singingstanza>

	<stanza type="verse" number="1">O home in the church,
  Where we've ended our search
With the brothers rejoicing all day;
  Where Christ is our life,
  And we're through with all strife,
Now we're home, hallelujah, to stay!</stanza>
	<stanza type="chorus" number="">Home, home in the church;
Yes, it's here that we've ended our search;
  And through all our days
  We will shout to His praise,
  "Hallelujah for Christ and the church!"</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">Here God is at rest,
  Of His treasures the best&amp;mdash;
How His heart is rejoicing all day!
  His home is our heart,
  Ne'er for Satan a part,
Here His glory He'll fully display.</stanza>
	<stanza type="chorus" number="">God's home is the church;
Yes, it's here that He ended His search;
  And through all our days
  We will shout to His praise,
  "Hallelujah for Christ and the church!"</stanza>
