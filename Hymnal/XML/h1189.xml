    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Son of Man, Son of Man on the throne today;
Son of Man, Pioneer, He has led the way;
Following, how we sing, Jesus leads us on;
We are marching with the Victor to the throne.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">On we go, on we go to the throne with Him;
On we go through this age, age so dark and grim;
Then shall we&amp;mdash;formerly, Satan's captured ones&amp;mdash;
Be exalted with the Lord upon His throne.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Called as sons, called as sons, destined to be kings;
Called as sons we've no time for the worldly things:
Yet we know, it is so&amp;mdash;we don't qualify!
Thus the Lord must search and burn and purify.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Search and burn, search and burn all our inward parts;
Search and burn, thoroughly, to refine our hearts;
We'll not fear, but be clear&amp;mdash;burning, searching thus
Is the gracious visit of the Lord to us.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">With the Man, with the Man is a rainbow fair;
Glorious bow, 'round the throne, faithfulness declares:
We deserved to be served with God's judgment sore,
But we have been spared to praise Him more and more.</stanza>
