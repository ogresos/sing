	<stanza type="verse" number="1">I've found the One of peerless worth,
  My heart doth sing for joy;
And sing I must, for Christ I have:
  Oh, what a Christ have I!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">My Christ, He is the Lamb of God,
  Who full salvation brings;
He is the Sun of Righteousness,
  With healing in His wings.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">My Christ, He is the Tree of Life
  With fruit abundant, sweet;
My hunger He doth satisfy;
  Of Him I daily eat.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">My Christ, He is the smitten Rock
  Whence living waters burst;
He is the fountain in my heart
  Which quenches all my thirst.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">Christ is my life, my light, my way,
  My comfort and my health,
My peace, my rest, my joy, my hope,
  My glory and my wealth.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">Christ is my wisdom and my pow'r,
  My boast and righteousness,
My vict'ry and redemption sure,
  My truth and holiness.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">Christ is my Savior, Shepherd, Lord,
  My Advocate above,
My Counsellor, my Father, God,
  My Brother, Friend, and Love.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="8">Christ is my Captain and my Guard,
  My Teacher and my Guide,
My Bridegroom, Master and my Head;
  In me doth He reside.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="9">Christ is my Prophet, Priest, and King;
  My Prophet full of sight;
My Priest that stands 'twixt me and God,
  My King that rules with might.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="10">Christ is the Author of my faith,
  And its Perfecter too,
My Mediator, Guarantee,
  And faithful Witness true.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="11">Christ is my everlasting home,
  My all-sufficient land;
My fortress, tower, hiding-place,
  And my eternal stand.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="12">Christ is my sabbath and new moon,
  My morning and my day,
My age and my eternity
  That ne'er will pass away.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="13">Christ is my trust and my desire,
  In comeliness replete,
My satisfaction and delight,
  Who all my need doth meet.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="14">My Christ, the all-inclusive One,
  My Christ what shall I call?
He is the first, He is the last,
  My Christ is All in all.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="15">Since such a treasure I possess,
  My heart doth sing for joy;
And I must sing, and sing again;
  Oh, what a Christ have I!</stanza>
