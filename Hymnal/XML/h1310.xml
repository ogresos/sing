    <stanza type="verse" number="1">The Lord is longing for His Bride,
  All glorious within.
His heart will then be satisfied
  When she is fit for Him.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">'Tis by the Word the church is made
  Holy and pure as He;
All spots and wrinkles it removes
  That she His Bride may be.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">We must redeem these golden days,
  Eating the Word in prayer,
Amening every line and phrase,
  And thus for Him prepare.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Oh, how the Word doth penetrate,
  Spirit and soul divide,
Revealing every hidden weight
  For us to lay aside.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Lord, how we thank Thee for Thy Word,
  Living and operative.
Oh, for Thy coming, we are stirred
  Ever by it to live!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Lord, make us those who bring Thee back,
  Who satisfy Thy heart.
Now by Thy Word supply our lack,
  Make us Thy counterpart.</stanza>
