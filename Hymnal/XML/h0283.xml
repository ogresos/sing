    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Lord, Thou knowest all the hunger
  Of the heart that seeks Thee now;
How my soul hath long been craving
  What Thou only canst bestow.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Seeking now, seeking now,
  Let Thy Spirit meet me now.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Failure in my walk and witness,
  Failure in my work I see;
Fruitless toil, un-Christlike living,
  Calling forth no praise to Thee.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Now to Thee my soul confesses
  All its failure, all its sin;
All the pride, the self-contentment,
  All the "secret faults" within.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Save me from myself, my Father,
  From each subtle form of pride;
Lead me now with Christ to Calvary,
  Show me I with Him have died.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">No more let it be my working,
  Nor my wisdom, love, or power,
But the life of Jesus only,
  Passing through me hour by hour.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Let the fulness of Thy Spirit
  Resting on Him cover me.
That the witness borne to others.
  May bring glory, Lord, to Thee.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Father, in Thy Son's Name pleading.
  I believe my prayer is heard;
And I praise Thee for the answer.
  Resting simply on Thy word.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Praising now, praising now.
Thou hast answered, Lord, I know.</stanza>
