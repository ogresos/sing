  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">I hear the words of love,
I gaze upon the blood,
I see the mighty sacrifice,
And I have peace with God.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">'Tis everlasting peace!
Sure as Jehovah's Name,
'Tis stable as His steadfast throne,
For evermore the same.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">The clouds may go and come,
And storms may sweep my sky;
This blood-sealed friendship changes not,
The Cross is ever nigh.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">My love is ofttimes low,
My joy still ebbs and flows,
But peace with Him remains the same,
No change my Savior knows.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">I change, He changes not;
The Christ can never die;
His love, not mine, the resting-place,
His truth, not mine, the tie.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">The Cross still stands unchanged,
Though heaven is now His home;
The mighty stone is rolled away,
But yonder is His tomb!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">And yonder is my peace,
The grave of all my woes!
I know the Son of God has come,
I know He died and rose.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">I know He liveth now
At God's right hand above;
I know the throne on which He sits,
I know His truth and love!</stanza>
