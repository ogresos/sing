    <stanza type="verse" number="1">In Revelation two and three,
The seven local churches see:
The lessons there for you and me
Are for the Lord's recovery.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">The words to them are words to us,
So that the church be glorious,
And all their warnings we must heed
So that the Lord can meet His need.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">To Ephesus, the word is clear:
"To your first love you're not so near;
You've left to work so far away;
Repent, return to Him today."</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Thus, we must all turn back to Him,
Leave other loves, for these are sin.
Oh, let us hearken to His call&amp;mdash;
If we miss this, we've missed it all!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Then unto Smyrna, suffering, sore&amp;mdash;
"You have been tried, but something more&amp;mdash;
Be faithful unto death," we're told
(Not just of body but of soul).</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Be faithful 'til what's natural dies;
Your circumstances don't despise;
The Lord has sent them all to you
To prove that your first love is true.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">From Pergamos we clearly see
The world has wed Christianity!
And faithful Antipas did fall&amp;mdash;
He dared to stand against it all.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">To wed the world we all must fear:
His spoken word will save us here&amp;mdash;
If to His speaking we give heed,
We'll separated be indeed.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="9">Then Thyatira comes at length:
Her mixture with the world her strength.
Fine flour leavened by the yeast,
A harlot riding on a beast.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="10">Lord, we are mixed but hardly know;
To us this mixture fully show.
Each added thing we will refute
Until we're wholly absolute.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="11">And then from Sardis, we can know
Life is the way that we must go!
She says she's living, but she's dead;
She needs to touch the Lord instead.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="12">Lord, take us all the way to life
To overcome the deadness rife.
Away from deadness we would flee
That full of life we'll always be.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="13">Now Philadelphia comes at last;
That which she has she should hold fast
The brothers' love, the name, the word;
This church has satisfied the Lord.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="14">We as the brothers all are one;
We're one by life, and life alone.
If we His word and name do keep
A glorious building God will reap.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="15">Laodicea warns us all:
From Philadelphia some will fall.
By saying, "I am rich," it's then
The Lord is outside wanting in.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="16">Lukewarmness we must ever spurn
And in the spirit always burn,
The inward life experience gain,
And pay the price with Him to reign.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="17">Lord, shine Your light on us today
That we may fully go Your way;
Anoint our eyes and let us see
So You can have recovery.</stanza>
