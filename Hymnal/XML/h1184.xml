    <stanza type="verse" number="1">In Revelation chapter one
God gives a vision of the Son,
Of Him who was and is to come;
Oh, let us to this One now come.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">In spirit hear His trumpet voice;
We must be turned to see His choice&amp;mdash;
The seven lampstands golden fair;
The Son of Man is walking there.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">The great high priestly robe He wears,
For every church He fully cares:
He trims the lamp, the oil supplies;
He makes them burn, flames in His eyes.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">A golden girdle on His breast&amp;mdash;
His work is done, and from His rest
He unto all the churches pours
Himself in love, the treasure store.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">His head, His hair is white as wool&amp;mdash;
The ancient One with youth is full.
His face is shining as the sun
To burn and lighten every one.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Oh, when this living One we see,
We'll fall as dead, we'll finished be.
But then the Lord His comfort gives&amp;mdash;
He once was dead, but now He lives.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Let every church just love Him more
His riches then He will outpour.
All other loves now lay aside;
Let's take this Jesus, none beside.</stanza>
