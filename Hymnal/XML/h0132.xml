	<stanza type="verse" number="1">Lo! in heaven Jesus sitting,
  Christ the Lord is there enthroned;
As the man by God exalted,
  With God's glory He is crowned.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">He hath put on human nature,
  Died according to God's plan,
Resurrected with a body,
  And ascended as a man.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">God in Him on earth was humbled,
  God with man was domiciled;
Man in Him in heav'n exalted,
  Man with God is reconciled.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">He as God with man is mingled,
  God in man is testified;
He as man with God is blended,
  Man in God is glorified.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">From the Glorified in heaven
  The inclusive Spirit came;
All of Jesus' work and Person
  Doth this Spirit here proclaim.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">With the Glorified in heaven
  Is the Church identified;
By the Spirit of this Jesus
  Are His members edified.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">Lo! a man is now in heaven
  As the Lord of all enthroned;
This is Jesus Christ our Savior,
  With God's glory ever crowned!</stanza>
