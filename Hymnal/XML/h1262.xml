    <stanza type="verse" number="1">It's by our mingled spirit, Lord,
  That we can shine with Thee,
And be a golden lampstand now
  For all the world to see.
It's not by forms or rituals,
  Mere Christianity;
It's by our Christ enjoyed as life
  We all can shine with Thee.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">The burning Christ has feet as brass
  Which in the furnace bums,
His eyes are as a flame of fire&amp;mdash;
  'Tis to this Christ we turn!
How could we ever lukewarm be
  When on His face we gaze?
O Lord, we give ourselves to You
  To set us all ablaze!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">The seven golden lampstands in
  The seven cities see,
So burning, shining with this Christ,
  It's God's economy!
We're absolute that this become
  Our full reality
Upon the earth, within the church
  In each locality.</stanza>
