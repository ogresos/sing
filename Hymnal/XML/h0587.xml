  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">'Tis so sweet to walk with Jesus,
  Step by step and day by day;
Stepping in His very footprints,
  Walking with Him all the way.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Step by step, step by step,
I would walk with Jesus,
All the day, all the way,
  Keeping step with Jesus.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">'Tis so safe to walk with Jesus,
  Leaning hard upon His arm,
Following closely where He leads us,
  None can hurt and naught can harm.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Step by step I'll walk with Jesus,
  Just a moment at a time,
Heights I have not wings to soar to,
  Step by step my feet can climb.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">All the way I'll walk with Jesus,
  Through the sunshine, through the gloom,
Though His blood-marked steps may lead me
  To the garden, to the tomb.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Here a while we walk with Jesus,
  But the time will not be long
Till the night shall change to morning,
  And the sorrow into song.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Then, with all who walked with Jesus,
  We shall walk with Him in white,
While He turns our grief to gladness,
  And our darkness into light.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Jesus, keep me closer&amp;mdash;closer,
  Step by step, and day by day;
Stepping in Thy very footprints,
  Walking with Thee all the way.</stanza>
