    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Praise to the Holiest in the height,
  And in the depth be praise:
In all His words most wonderful;
  Most sure in all His ways.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">O loving wisdom of our God,
  When all was sin and shame,
He, the last Adam, to the fight
  And to the rescue came.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">O wisest love! that flesh and blood
  Which did in Adam fail,
Should strive afresh against the foe,
  Should strive and should prevail.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">And that a higher gift than grace
  Should flesh and blood refine,
God's presence, and His very self
  And essence all-divine.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">O generous love! that He, who smote
  In man for man the foe,
The double agony in man
  For man should undergo.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">And in the garden secretly,
  And on the cross on high,
Should teach His brethren, and inspire
  To suffer and to die.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Praise to the Holiest in the height,
  And in the depth be praise:
In all His words most wonderful;
  Most sure in all His ways.</stanza>
