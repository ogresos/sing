	<stanza type="verse" number="1">The cross that He gave may be heavy,
  But it ne'er outweighs His grace;
The storm that I feared may surround me,
  But it ne'er excludes His face.</stanza>
	<stanza type="chorus" number="">The cross is not greater than His grace,
The storm cannot hide His blessed face;
  I am satisfied to know
  That with Jesus here below,
    I can conquer every foe.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">The thorns in my path are not sharper
  Than composed His crown for me;
The cup that I drink not more bitter
  Than He drank in Gethsemane.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">The light of His love shineth brighter,
  As it falls on paths of woe;
The toil of my work groweth lighter,
  As I stoop to raise the low.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">His will I have joy in fulfilling,
  As I'm walking in His sight;
My trials more blessings are bringing,
  Christ in them is my delight.</stanza>
