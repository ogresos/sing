	<stanza type="verse" number="1">Now the Triune God has come to dwell within
  As the wonderful Spirit in us.
We are mingled with the Lord, we're one with Him
  As the life-giving Spirit in us.</stanza>
	<stanza type="chorus" number="">Oh, He's the wonderful Spirit in us,
He's the wonderful Spirit in us!
God is in the Son, the Son's the Spirit now&amp;mdash;
  He's the wonderful Spirit in us!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">"Abba Father" is the cry from deep within
  From the wonderful Spirit in us.
'Tis the Spirit of the Son who cries to Him
  As the life-giving Spirit in us.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">Jesus Christ the Lord is living now in us
  As the wonderful Spirit within.
He has been transfigured, we enjoy Him thus,
  As the life-giving Spirit within.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">Now the Spirit of reality is here
  As the wonderful Spirit within.
Now the things of Christ are all so real and clear
  By the life-giving Spirit within.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">We will all stir up this gift that's deep within
  As the wonderful Spirit in us.
When we call "Lord Jesus" how our spirits spring
  With this life-giving Spirit in us!</stanza>
