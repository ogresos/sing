  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">My song is love unknown,
  My Savior's love to me;
Love to the loveless shown,
  That they might lovely be.
    O who am I,
    That for my sake
    My Lord should take
    Frail flesh, and die?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">He came from His blest throne
  Salvation to bestow;
But men made strange, and none
  The longed-for Christ would know:
    But oh, my Friend,
    My Friend indeed,
    Who at my need
    His life did spend.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Sometimes they strew His way,
  And His sweet praises sing;
Resounding all the day
  Hosannas to their King:
    Then "Crucify!"
    Is all their breath,
    And for His death
    They thirst and cry.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">They rise and needs will have
  My dear Lord made away;
A murderer they save,
  The Prince of life they slay.
    Yet cheerful He
    To suffering goes,
    That He His foes
    From thence might free.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">In life, no house, no home
  My Lord on earth might have;
In death, no friendly tomb,
  But what a stranger gave.
    What may I say?
    Heav'n was His home;
    But mine the tomb
    Wherein He lay.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Here might I stay and sing,
  No story so divine;
Never was love, dear King,
  Never was grief like Thine.
    This is my Friend,
    In whose sweet praise
    I all my days
    Could gladly spend.</stanza>
