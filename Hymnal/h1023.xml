    <stanza type="verse" number="1">I need Thee, precious Jesus!
  For I am full of sin;
My soul is dark and guilty,
  My spirit dead within:
I need the cleansing fountain,
  Where I can always flee:
The blood of Christ most precious,
  The sinner's perfect plea.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">I need Thee, precious Jesus!
  For I am very poor;
A stranger and a pilgrim,
  I have no earthly store:
I need the love of Jesus,
  To cheer me on my way,
To guide my doubting footsteps,
  To be my strength and stay.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">I need Thee, precious Jesus!
  I need a friend like Thee;
A friend to soothe and comfort,
  A friend to care for me:
I need the heart of Jesus,
  To feel each anxious care,
To bear my every burden,
  And all my sorrow share.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">I need Thee, precious Jesus!
  I need Thee day by day,
To fill me with Thy fulness,
  To lead me on my way;
I need Thy Holy Spirit,
  To teach me what I am;
To show me more of Jesus,
  To point me to the Lamb.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">I need Thee, precious Jesus!
  And hope to see Thee soon,
Encircled with Thy glory,
  And seated on Thy throne;
There with Thy blood-bought people,
  My joy shall ever be
To praise Thee, precious Jesus,
  To gaze, my Lord, on Thee.</stanza>
