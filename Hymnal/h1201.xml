    <stanza type="verse" number="1">From the north where God is dwelling
Comes a rushing, stormy gale.
Now the mighty Spirit blowing
All our being does assail.
We are stirred to our foundations&amp;mdash;
How this wind awakens us!
Thus we're open for God's dealings,
And the cloud descends on us.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">With the cloud we have His presence
Sweetly hov'ring over us;
So enveloped by His nearness;
In the Lord we put our trust.
But the cloud brings with it fire
To consume our selfish lusts;
That as ashes something higher
May be added into us.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Then from out the flashing fire
Comes th' electrum glowing bright.
God as gold and man as silver
Now are mingled. What a sight!
This bright metal, O Lord Jesus,
Is Thyself, Lamb-God sublime.
O Lord, work Thyself within us
Till th' electrum in us shines.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">By our passing through this cycle,
Living creatures we become
To express the life of Jesus;
He with whom we've been made one.
We express Him as a human,
As a man so good and fine;
Balanced, normal, never striving;
Fully human, yet divine.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">We express Him as a lion
Conquering every enemy;
As an ox obedient, lowly,
Faithful in His ministry.
We express Him as an eagle,
So transcendent, soaring high;
Never held by fear or flatter,
He above it all does fly.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Hallelujah! What a figure
Of the way God deals with us!
From the wind, cloud, fire, electrum,
To the creatures glorious:
As the man, the ox and lion,
As the eagle&amp;mdash;all the four
Will be our complete expression
As we eat Him more and more.</stanza>
