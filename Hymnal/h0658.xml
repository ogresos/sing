    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Walk in the light, and thou shalt know
  That fellowship of love
His Spirit only can bestow,
  Who reigns in light above.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Walk in the light, and thou shalt find
  Thy heart made truly His;
Who dwells in cloudless light enshrined,
  In whom no darkness is.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Walk in the light, and sin abhorred
  Shall ne'er defile again;
The blood of Jesus Christ the Lord
  Shall cleanse from every stain.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Walk in the light, and e'en the tomb
  No fearful shade shall wear;
The glory shall dispel the gloom,
  For Christ hath conquered there.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Walk in the light, and thou shalt own
  Thy darkness passed away,
Because that light hath on thee shone
  In which is Perfect day.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Walk in the light, thy path shall be
  Serene and clear and bright;
For God, by grace, shall dwell in thee,
  And God Himself is Light.</stanza>
