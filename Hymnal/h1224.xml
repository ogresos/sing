    <stanza type="verse" number="1">We from the law to Christ have turned;
To trust in Him by grace we've learned.
And since His glory we've discerned
  We only care for Christ!</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">We only care for Christ!
We only care for Christ!
And since His glory we've discerned
  We only care for Christ!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Christ brings us to God's house to dwell,
Where all day long His praises swell.
O hallelujah! None can tell
  How lovely is God's house!</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">How lovely is God's house!
How lovely is God's house!
O hallelujah! None can tell
  How lovely is God's house!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">The house enlarged the city is;
The joy of all the nations 'tis,
The place for God to rule is this
  On Zion's holy hill.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">On Zion's holy hill,
On Zion's holy hill,
The place for God to rule is this
  On Zion's holy hill.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">From Zion Christ will take the earth
And reign and fill its souls with mirth.
All nations will proclaim His worth,
  Break forth and sing for joy.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Break forth and sing for joy,
Break forth and sing for joy,
All nations will proclaim His worth,
  Break forth and sing for joy.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Christ&amp;mdash;house&amp;mdash;the city&amp;mdash;earth, we see;
Thus God's great plan fulfilled will be.
O brothers, let us utterly
  Be one with Him for this.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Be one with Him for this,
Be one with Him for this,
O brothers, let us utterly
  Be one with Him for this.</stanza>
