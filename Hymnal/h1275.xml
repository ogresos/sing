    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Glorious things to thee are spoken,
  Philadelphia, church of love.
These things saith the One who's holy,
  He who's real speaks from above;
He that has the key of David,
  Who the kingdom's entrance won,
"I will open, no man shutteth"&amp;mdash;
  He has spoken; it is done.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Hallelujah, Philadelphia,
  Thine are works that please the Lord.
Strength thou hast, though just a little
  And hast kept His living Word.
Thou His holy name denied not,
  But confessed it here below&amp;mdash;
Lo, a door is set before thee,
  Through which none but thee can go.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Thou, beloved Philadelphia,
  Dost His Word of patience keep.
From the hour of trial He'll save thee,
  Which o'er all the world shall sweep.
Troublers too shall know He loves thee;
  They to thee must then bow down.
"Hold thou fast, for I come quickly,
  That no man may take thy crown."</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Hallelujah, overcomers,
  "In the temple of My God,
I will build them in as pillars,
  Nevermore to go abroad."
God's own name is written on them
  And the new name of the Lord.
With the triune God they're blended;
  They're the city of our God.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Hallelujah, out of heaven,
  Comes the New Jerusalem:
Gates of pearl and walls of jasper,
  Mingled with each precious gem.
Philadelphia, Philadelphia,
  Has become His Bride so dear.
Now the Spirit in the churches
  Speaks to all who have an ear.</stanza>
