	<stanza type="verse" number="1">The law of God is holy, good,
To practise good it doth command;
Its purpose is to clearly show
That we cannot meet God's demand.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">Yet in our mind there is a law
Which always tries the good to do;
But in our members is a law
Which always doth this law subdue.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">The law within our mind is good,
'Tis of our human life obtained
At our creation from the Lord,
That good behavior be maintained.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">The law within our members is
The evil of satanic life;
Into our members at the fall
It came thru Satan's subtle strife.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">This evil law of Satan is
The law of sin, in us its seat;
'Tis stronger than the law of good
And always brings it to defeat.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">But in our spirit is a law,
Which is the Spirit's law of life;
'Tis of the very life of God
Which we from our rebirth derive.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">This law divine the strongest is,
Transcending all the others o'er;
From sin's law freeing, it fulfills
The full requirement of God's law.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="8">We then must always set our mind
Upon the spirit deep within,
And not upon the things of flesh,
The body ruined by the sin.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="9">To set the mind upon the flesh
Is sin and death and darkest night;
The mind upon the spirit set
Is life and peace and full of light.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="10">This is the way of true release!
This is the way of victory!
Lord, may we in the spirit live,
And by the Spirit walk with Thee.</stanza>
