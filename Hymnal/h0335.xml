    <stanza type="verse" number="1">I was lost in sin but Jesus rescued me,
  He's a wonderful Savior to me;
I was bound by fear but Jesus set me free,
  He's a wonderful Savior to me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">For He's a wonderful Savior to me,
  He's a wonderful Savior to me;
I was lost in sin, but Jesus took me in,
    He's a wonderful Savior to me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">He's a Friend so true, so patient and so kind,
  He's a wonderful Savior to me;
Everything I need in Him I always find,
  He's a wonderful Savior to me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">He is always near to comfort and to cheer,
  He's a wonderful Savior to me;
He forgives my sins, He dries my every tear,
  He's a wonderful Savior to me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Dearer grows the love of Jesus day by day,
  He's a wonderful Savior to me;
Sweeter is His grace while pressing on my way,
  He's a wonderful Savior to me.</stanza>
