	<stanza type="verse" number="1">Glory to Christ on high!
Let praises fill the sky!
  Praise ye His name:
He all our sorrows bore;
Angels His name&amp;mdash;adore,
And saints cry evermore,
  "Worthy the Lamb!"</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">All they around the throne
Cheerfully join in one,
  Praising His name:
We who have known His blood
Sealing our peace with God,
Spread His dear name abroad;
  Worthy the Lamb!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">Join all the human race
Our Lord, God's Christ, to bless,
  Praise ye His name:
In Him we will rejoice,
Making a cheerful noise,
Saving with heart and voice,
  "Worthy the Lamb!"</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">Though we must change our place,
Our hearts shall never cease
  Praising His name:
To Him we'll tribute bring,
Laud Him, our gracious King,
And without ceasing, sing,
  "Worthy the Lamb!"</stanza>
