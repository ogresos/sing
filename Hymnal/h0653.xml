    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Rest, rest thee, weary heart,
    Let toil and anguish cease;
  Take from Thy Savior's hands
    Thine heritage of peace.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Lie low before His feet,
    Too low thou canst not be,
  For sacred calm is here,
    And here is liberty.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Submit, lay down thine arms,
    Nor question, nor rebel;
  So shalt thou hear erewhile
    His whisper, It is well.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">No secret wound of thine,
    Though it be great or small,
  Presume to hide from Him;
    Confess, confess it all;</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Nor merit of thine own
    Upon His altar place;
  All is of Christ alone,
    And of His perfect grace.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Rest, rest thee, weary heart,
    Let care and anguish cease;
  Take from thy Savior's hands
    Thine heritage of peace.</stanza>
