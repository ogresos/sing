    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Lord, Thou art our consecration,
  Thou the consecrated One;
Thou hast satisfied the Father&amp;mdash;
  Consecration thus was done.
When on earth Thou hadst no pleasure,
  Save to do the Father's will;
Now Thou livest here within us,
  Consecration to fulfill.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Lord, we praise Thee for the picture:
  Consecration's ram we see,
Burnt for God's full satisfaction,
  Eaten and enjoyed to be.
Thou art now our ram, Lord Jesus,
  Offered for the will of God;
By Thy consecration, faultless,
  We may walk where Thou hast trod.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">As we eat Thyself, Lord Jesus,
  Consecrated we become;
By Thy wondrous life within us,
  Thy obedience is our own.
No more need we strive and struggle,
  Consecrated try to be;
Consecration dwells within us&amp;mdash;
  Now our part to eat of Thee.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Lord, we praise Thee, consecration
  Is nought else but Thee as food:
As we eat Thee and enjoy Thee,
  We are all made one with God;
One in will and one in purpose
  We become by eating Thee:
As we take and eat Thyself, Lord,
  Consecrated we will be.</stanza>
