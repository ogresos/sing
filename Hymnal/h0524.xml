  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">I have found, I have found the way
  Which leads to heav'nly rest;
I have found, I have found the peace
  Which filled my Savior's breast.
O friends in the desert past,
  Come, join in prayer and praise;
E'en now He waits our cry,
  The Savior who saves always.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">He hath taken our sins away,
  When on Calv'ry's cross He bled;
The disease of our soul He heals
  By His Spirit freely shed;
Though Satan hath pierced us deep,
  And great the grace each prays;
The more we prove His might,
  The Savior who saves always.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Long, alas! in the gloom I fought,
  'Mid strife of wind and waves;
Jesus seemed only this to me:
  A Savior who sometimes saves.
But sweet are the light and calm
  That fill my happy days,
Since now I fully trust
  The Savior who saves always.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">O my Sun and my Shield art Thou
  Lead on where Thou hast trod;
My Salvation, my Joy, my Song,
  My Brother, and yet my God.
Whate'er then my life betide,
  I now can trust and praise;
Each moment Thou wilt save,
  O Savior, who sav'st always.</stanza>
