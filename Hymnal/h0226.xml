  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">For the bread and for the wine,
For the pledge that seals Him mine,
For the words of love divine,
We give Thee thanks, O Lord.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Only bread and only wine,
Yet to faith, the solemn sign
Of the heav'nly and divine!
We give Thee thanks, O Lord.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">For the words that turn our eye
To the cross of Calvary,
Bidding us in faith draw nigh,
We give Thee thanks, O Lord.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">For the words that fragrance breathe
These plain symbols underneath,
Words that His own peace bequeath,
We give Thee thanks, O Lord.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">For Thy words in Spirit, shown,
For Thy will to us made known,
"Do ye this until I come,"
We give Thee thanks, O Lord.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Till He come we take the bread,
Type of Him on whom we feed,
Him who liveth and was dead!
We give Thee thanks, O Lord.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Till He come we take the cup;
As we at His table sup,
Eye and heart are lifted up!
We give Thee thanks, O Lord.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">For that coming, here foreshown,
For that day to man unknown,
For the glory and the throne,
We give Thee thanks, O Lord.</stanza>
