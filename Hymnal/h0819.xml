  <lyrics>
	<stanza type="verse" number="1">As the body is the fulness
  To express our life,
So to Christ the Church, His Body,
  Doth express His life.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">E'en as Eve is part of Adam
  Taken out of him,
So the Church is Christ's own increase
  With Himself within.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">As from out the buried kernel
  Many grains are formed,
As the grains together blended
  To a loaf are formed;</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">So the Church, of many Christians,
  Christ doth multiply,
Him expressing as one Body,
  God to glorify.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">As the branches of the grapevine
  Are its outward spread,
With it one, abiding, bearing
  Clusters in its stead;</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">So the Church's many members
  Christ's enlargement are,
One with Him in life and living,
  Spreading Him afar.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">Fulness, increase, duplication,
  His expression full,
Growth and spread, continuation,
  Surplus plentiful,</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="8">Is the Church to Christ, and thereby
  God in Christ may be
Glorified thru His redeemed ones
  To eternity.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="9">Thus the Church and Christ together,
  God's great mystery,
Is the mingling of the Godhead
  With humanity.</stanza>
