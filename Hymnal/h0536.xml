  <lyrics>
	<stanza type="verse" number="1">Objective and subjective Christ is to us,
In heaven He's pleading objectively thus;
Subjectively now in His members He lives
And inwardly to them His being He gives.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">In heaven He sits at the right hand of God,
Where as the High Priest He presented His blood;
Our Advocate, bearing our burdens above,
Our Surety, He careth for us in His love.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">He now is the Spirit, our spirit within;
He's there as our life, all things bringing with Him;
He's there as our strength and our grace every hour,
Our Paraclete in us, sustaining with pow'r.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">In heaven for us He's the glorified man,
The Forerunner entered, fulfilling God's plan;
Man into God bringing and making him one
With God in the heav'nlies, in Him as the Son.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">In us all the fulness of God dwells in Him;
As Spirit He brings God Himself thus within,
Revealing and making God real unto us,
God one with us building in life glorious.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">The Savior ascended in heaven now dwells,
And soon He's returning for us His Word tells;
Deliverer indwelling, He now in us lives,
And soon will transfigure, His glory to give.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">The day soon is coming when heaven and earth
Will mingle in one in that city of worth;
Objective and subjective will in that day
Be mingled within us in glory for aye.</stanza>
