  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Jesus waits for you, hoping you will come
  In the years that you are giv'n.
Jesus calls again, through repentance come
  To enjoy the peace of heav'n.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">He is calling, calling; hear Him calling now,
  That you might His grace receive;
He is able, willing, waiting to redeem,
  Ready that you might believe.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">You've been wandering, wand'ring for some ways,
  Sinking in the grip of sin.
Yet He's patient still, patient as He sways,
  Weary hearts He wants to win.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Many times He called, though you've turned away;
  He is caring still for you.
He will not allow His love to be swayed
  As He urges you anew.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">To His call submit, find His love your home;
  Jesus now yet waits for you.
He is calling still, "Unto Me now come."
  Answer to Him, "Yes, I do."</stanza>
