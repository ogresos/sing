	<stanza type="verse" number="1">To the foe my word is always, "No,"
  To the Father it is "Yes,"
That His plan and all His counsel
  Be accomplished with success;
When Thine orders I'm obeying,
  Grant me, Lord, authority
To fulfill Thy plan eternal
  Thru the Spirit's power in me.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">To the foe my word is always, "No,"
  To the Father it is, "Yes";
'Tis my attitude eternal;
  May the Lord protect and bless,
Lest while walking in obedience
  Satan undermine the way;
When I'm list'ning to Thine orders,
  Grant me mercy, Lord, I pray.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">To the foe my word is always, "No,"
  To the Father it is, "Yes";
I completely would obey Him,
  Though deep suff'ring may oppress.
If the Lord will save and keep me,
  As I forward press with Him,
Then no trials shall prevent me,
  Nor will opposition grim.</stanza>
