    <stanza type="verse" number="1">"Though your sins be as scarlet,
  They shall be as white as snow;
Though your sins be as scarlet,
  They shall be as white as snow;
Though they be red as crimson,
  They shall be as wool;"
"Though your sins be as scarlet,
Though your sins be as scarlet,
  They shall be as white as snow,
  They shall be as white as snow.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Hear the voice that entreats you,
  O return ye unto God!
Hear the voice that entreats you,
  O return ye unto God!
He is of great compassion,
  And of wondrous love;
Hear the voice that entreats you,
Hear the voice that entreats you,
  O return ye unto God!
  O return ye unto God!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">He'll forgive your transgressions,
  And remember them no more;
He'll forgive your transgressions,
  And remember them no more;
"Look unto Me, ye people,"
  Saith the Lord your God!
He'll forgive your transgressions,
He'll forgive your transgressions,
  And remember them no more,
  And remember them no more.</stanza>
