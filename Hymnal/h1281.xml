    <stanza type="verse" number="1">All the meetings Christ appointed
  And attended here on earth
Were apart from all religion,
  All its rituals, forms, and dearth.
Resurrection, not religion,
  Must be our reality;
Let us meet in resurrection,
  From all dead religion free.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">When the Lord was resurrected,
  All religious things were through;
Christ is now our living temple,
  Christ is all our offerings too.
With our Lord in resurrection,
  Hallelujah, we're released!
Pity all the old religion&amp;mdash;
  All our meetings are a feast!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Yet religion&amp;mdash;oh, how subtle&amp;mdash;
  In our blood is hiding out;
God must give us revelation,
  All that unseen monster rout.
Lord, we still are too religious&amp;mdash;
  Down with our religious soul!
We would all release our spirit,
  Let each meeting reach the goal.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">In the meetings, in the meetings,
  On the mountain, at the shore,
Jesus, Jesus, living Jesus,
  He is here&amp;mdash;what want we more?
Bury all the old religion,
  Even Christianity&amp;mdash;
Jesus, Jesus, we have Jesus,
  He is our reality!</stanza>
