    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Oh, hallelujah, what a death
  Christ died upon the cross!
Not only was He dying there
But everything that death did share:
  God was included too,
  All men with me and you&amp;mdash;
Oh hallelujah, for such a cross!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Oh, praise the Lord, man died in God
  And to an end was brought!
Now from this man I'm wholly free
For God has terminated me!
  Oh, what a wondrous death,
  Oh, what a wondrous death;
Oh, hallelujah, for such a death!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Oh, praise the Lord, God died in man,
  In man to be released.
The grain of wheat fell to the ground,
And now a multitude is found
  Filled with the life of God,
  Filled with the life of God;
Oh, hallelujah, for such a life!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Lord, how we praise You for Your cross,
  Your all-inclusive death!
The center of the universe,
It has untold, eternal worth!
  Lord, how we love Your cross,
  Lord, how we love Your cross;
Oh, hallelujah, for such a cross!</stanza>
