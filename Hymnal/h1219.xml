    <stanza type="verse" number="1">What a wonderful change in my living is wrought
  By saying Amen to God's Word.
More of Christ into me at each instance is brought
  By saying Amen to His Word.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">By saying Amen to His Word,
By saying Amen to His Word,
Thus the Lord takes my heart, and transforms every part,
  By saying Amen to His Word.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">What I never could do God is doing in me,
  By saying Amen to His Word.
And the change is so real all the brothers can see,
  By saying Amen to God's Word.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">I have ceased from my wandering and going astray
  By saying Amen to God's Word.
And my old inclinations are passing away
  By saying Amen to His Word.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Now the secret of faith in the Lord I can see&amp;mdash;
  It's saying Amen to His Word.
He is more real and precious than all things to me
  By saying Amen to His Word.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Now my love for the brothers abounds more and more
  By saying Amen to God's Word.
And I'm being related as never before
  By saying Amen to His Word.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Now my hope in the Lord's soon return groweth bright
  By saying Amen to His Word.
I am ready to see Him, my Lord, my delight,
  By saying Amen to His Word.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Lord Jesus, Amen to Your Word,
Lord Jesus, Amen to Your Word.
You are coming again&amp;mdash;all my heart says Amen!
  Lord Jesus, Amen to Your Word!</stanza>
