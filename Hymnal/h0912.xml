	<stanza type="verse" number="1">Christ to minister is service
  Both to God and others too,
Christ, the surplus, e'er supplying,
  Off'ring Him as service true.</stanza>
	<stanza type="chorus" number="">Christ to minister is service
  Both to God and others too,
Christ, the surplus, e'er supplying,
    Off'ring Him as service true.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">As the Israelites did offer
  From the surplus of their land,
Thus some produce reaped of Jesus
  Must be in our serving hand.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">We on Christ, as land, must labor,
  Harvest Him for all our fare;
Tasting Him to overflowing,
  Christ with others we may share.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">Holding Christ, as members growing,
  Each his function must observe;
Christ receiving, Christ partaking,
  To His Body Christ we serve.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">Fellowship and testimony,
  Ministry and worship too,
In all helps and ministrations
  Christ is all our service true.</stanza>
