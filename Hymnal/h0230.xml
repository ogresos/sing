    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Lord Jesus, in Thy precious name,
  And in that name alone;
At Thy request we gladly meet,
  Thy Lordship here would own.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">As on that dark betrayal night,
  Thou didst this feast ordain;
We too, the bread and cup would take,
  Thy death, Lord, thus proclaim.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">The bread, Thy body doth portray;
  The cup, Thy precious blood;
By which our sin was put away,
  Our peace was made with God.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">The Host art Thou, O blessed Lord,
  Thy honored guests are we;
With grateful and adoring hearts
  We would remember Thee!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Lord Jesus, whom unseen we love,
  As thus we muse on Thee;
We none would see, save Thee alone,
  Thou Man of Calvary!</stanza>
