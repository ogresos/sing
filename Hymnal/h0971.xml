  <lyrics>
	<stanza type="verse" number="1">God's eternal purpose
  Is to join with man,
Causing man, His vessel,
  To be born again,
His own life imparting,
  Filling to the brim;
Man may thus express Him,
  And be one with Him.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">God in His own image
  Hath created man,
That he may be able
  To fulfill His plan;
That he may receive Him
  As the tree of life
To become His fulness
  As to man the wife.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">In His life's rich flowing
  Man will be transformed
Into precious substance
  And to Him conformed.
Thus will man be builded
  As His counterpart,
Thus to be His dwelling,
  Satisfy His heart.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">'Tis the holy city,
  New Jerusalem;
With His saints God mingles,
  Makes His home with them.
He becomes their content,
  His expression they;
They shall share His glory,
  One with Him for aye.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">He's the very center,
  Ruling on the throne;
By His life the power,
  Saints are kept in one.
By His light of glory,
  They are kept in light,
Harmony enjoying
  In divine delight.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">He's their living water,
  And their food supply;
All their thirst and hunger
  He doth satisfy.
He's for them the temple,
  In Himself they live,
In His constant presence
  Worship ever give.</stanza>
