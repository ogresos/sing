    <stanza type="verse" number="1">By righteousness was I condemned,
When I was lost in pain and sin;
When Christ redeemed me by His blood,
Thy righteousness gave peace within.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">O God, Thy righteousness condemned
My Savior to the cross to die;
Yet now to us Thy righteousness
Grants peace, forgives, and justifies.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Righteousness ruled all debts be paid;
Yet, also, righteousness forbade
That when accounts were fully paid
Again collection could be made.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Now that my Lord His blood has shed,
You cannot sentence Him again,
Nor ask me further recompense,
Can but forgive and fully cleanse.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">When first I heard of righteousness,
Fearful, I sought to hide from thence,
But at its mention now I sense
Such sweetness and such preciousness.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Since I have known Thy righteousness,
Thy grace I can more clearly see;
Thy righteousness gives wondrous rest,
Thy grace supplies and comforts me.</stanza>
