    <stanza type="verse" number="1">The Lord knows all that frustrates you!
He knows your every weakness, too.
The secrets you could never tell!
The Lord's word says: I know it well.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">He knows how hard the trials you face,
He knows how much you need His grace,
He foreknew all that happens here,
He is your Lord, why doubt or fear.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Though many ridicule, oppose,
Friends, fam'ly leave, misunderstand;
All things about you, Jesus knows;
So be at peace; it's in His hand.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Trust all your burdens to the Lord,
Pour out to Him your sighing, too;
His heart of love your sorrow knows,
He'll grant His grace, He'll see you through.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">If but He knows, my heart's assuaged;
If but He knows, My joy's restored.
If but He knows, He'll surely save.
If but He knows, What need I more?</stanza>
