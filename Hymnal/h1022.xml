    <stanza type="verse" number="1">I've tried in vain a thousand ways
My fears to quell, my hopes to raise;
But what I need, the Bible says,
  Is ever, only Jesus.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">My soul is night, my heart is steel&amp;mdash;
I cannot see, I cannot feel;
For light, for life I must appeal
  In simple faith to Jesus.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">He died, He lives, He reigns, He pleads;
There's love in all His words and deeds;
There's all a guilty sinner needs
  Forevermore in Jesus.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Though some should sneer, and some should blame,
I'll go with all my guilt and shame;
I'll go to Him because His name,
  Above all names, is Jesus.</stanza>
