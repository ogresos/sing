	<stanza type="verse" number="1">O Jesus Lord, when present at Thy table,
And on the bread and on the wine we gaze;
We praise Thee, Lord, that Thou as food art able
To be enjoyed by man in many ways.</stanza>
	<stanza type="chorus" number="">So all our being sings in praise to Thee,
How small Thou art, how small Thou art!
And Thee we'll eat through all eternity;
  How small Thou art, how small Thou art!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">O what a shame&amp;mdash;when Christ with all His riches,
Has come into the world, life to supply&amp;mdash;
That man would live, not by Him, but by teachings,
So powerless these riches to apply.</stanza>
	<stanza type="chorus" number="">But all we need to do is eat the Lord;
He's marvelous, He's wonderful!
And as we eat, we're inwardly restored;
  Christ grows in us, grows to the full.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">O Jesus Christ, Thou camest not to mankind
To be a king, to rule us outwardly.
But Thou hast come as food to satisfy us,
And by Thy life to guide us inwardly.</stanza>
	<stanza type="chorus" number="">(First chorus)</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">We praise Thee, Lord, for all Thy glorious grandeur,
For all Thy strength and majesty replete;
And yet, O Lord, what special thanks we give Thee,
That all Thou art is small enough to eat.</stanza>
	<stanza type="chorus" number="">(First chorus)</stanza>
