	<stanza type="verse" number="1">Lord, Thou art all the offerings
  Prepared by God for us;
They are so rich in meaning,
  So sweet and glorious.
They have fulfilled God's purpose
  And met His heart's desire;
They too have satisfied us,
  And faced what we require.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">Thou art the burnt-oblation,
  Consumed by holy fire;
To God as a sweet savor,
  Fulfilling His desire.
Thou walkedst in God's presence,
  And all His will pursued;
Thyself the spotless offering,
  For us to God as food.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">Thou art the meal-oblation,
  With "oil" and "frankincense";
'Tis holy, fine, and perfect,
  And sweet to every sense.
Thou art the peace-oblation,
  The peace for us to make,
That we with God may share Thee,
  As food of Thee partake.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">Thou art the sin-oblation,
  For us Thou sin wast made;
By death for our redemption
  The ransom Thou hast paid.
Thou art the trespass-offering,
  Thou all our sins didst bear
To satisfy God's justice,
  That we His pardon share.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">Thou art the wave-oblation,
  The resurrected One;
O'er hades, death and darkness,
  The vict'ry Thou hast won.
Thou art the heave-oblation,
  Thou didst ascend to God;
As such in heav'nly places
  Thou art our holy food.</stanza>
