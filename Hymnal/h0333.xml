    <stanza type="verse" number="1">I know not why God's wondrous grace
  To me He hath made known,
Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love
  Redeemed me for His own.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">But "I know Whom I have believed
And am persuaded that He is able
To keep that which I've committed
  Unto Him against that day."</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">I know not how this saving faith
  To me He did impart,
Nor how believing in His word
  Wrought peace within my heart.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">I know not how the Spirit moves,
  Convincing men of sin,
Revealing Jesus through the Word,
  Creating faith in Him.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">I know not what of good or ill
  May be reserved for me,
Of weary ways or golden days,
  Before His face I see.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">I know not when my Lord may come,
  At night or noon-day fair,
Nor if I'll walk the vale with Him,
  Or "meet Him in the air."</stanza>
