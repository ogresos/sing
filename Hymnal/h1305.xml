    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Our faith to God-ward must in these days spread abroad
To show we've turned from idols to the living God.
We'll mix His Word with faith by answering "Amen!"
And to Christ in the Word turn again and again.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Our work of faith must grow exceedingly,
The labor of our love increase abundantly,
His sanctifying work in us go on and on,
While in patience of hope we will watch till He come.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">The love for all the brothers, in our midst is found,
But in these days our love must increase and abound.
The Lord direct our hearts into the love of God
And prepare us in full for the day of the Lord.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Our spirit, soul, and body wholly sanctified&amp;mdash;
Our faithful Lord will do it to prepare His Bride
While we amen His voice in matters great or small,
That we all may be ready to hear Jesus' call.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">The Lord Himself shall come, and we shall be with Him&amp;mdash;
Oh, what a glorious hope! Come quickly, Lord, Amen.
We'd ever watchful be to see Thee in the air
And as sons of the day for that meeting prepare.</stanza>
