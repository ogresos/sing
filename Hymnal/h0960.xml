  <lyrics>
	<stanza type="verse" number="1">My King will soon come back again,
  The sky be filled with Him;
The universe to be redeemed
  Will see His light therein.
The Lord will soon fulfill His plan,
  His footsteps now I hear;
His glorious frame I faintly see
  Beginning to appear.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">I'm longing for His presence blest
  And dare not slothful be
While waiting for my Lord's return,
  His own dear self to see.
My only hope&amp;mdash;that He may come
  And change my faith to sight;
There is no other joy on earth
  Which gives my heart delight.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">My heart is always with Himself,
  My eyes are heavenward,
My lips would utter nothing else
  Than meeting with my Lord.
The coming of the Lord draws nigh,
  His coming is for me;
His promise ever standeth firm
  And soon fulfilled I'll see.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">My Savior, all Thy holy words
  Can never doubted be;
With them encouraged day by day,
  I'm faithful unto Thee.
Oh, may Thy glory soon appear,
  The foe be overthrown;
Thy promises be realized,
  And we brought to Thy throne.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">Thy saving arm a refuge is,
  My Savior God, to me;
Thou as the Father keepeth them
  Who put their trust in Thee.
The sheep and shepherd are of one,
  The head and body same;
None e'er can pluck from out Thy hand
  The child who trusts Thy Name.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">A thousand hands won't hinder me,
  Nor will ten thousand eyes;
The thorns upon the road but help
  Me onward to the prize.
Arise, my spirit and my heart,
  And let the world go by;
The Lord of life will take me soon
  To be with Him on high.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">Thou healing sun! Thou hope of man!
  I really love Thy ray.
Oh, righteous Lord! oh, glorious King!
  I bow to Thee and pray:
Oh, may Thou soon ascend Thy throne
  And quickly show Thy face;
Thy heav'nly kingdom may Thou found
  And grant all men Thy grace.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="8">The truth should triumph and be king,
  And freedom should be queen;
But falsehood, which has rampant run,
  Head of the world be seen.
We ask Thee, Truth, to quickly come
  And bring Thy light from heav'n;
The foe be crushed and all Thy sons
  Into Thy bosom giv'n.</stanza>
