  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">My faith has found a resting place,
  Not in device nor creed;
I trust the Ever-living One,
  His wounds for me shall plead.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">I need no other argument,
  I need no other plea;
It is enough that Jesus died,
    And that He died for me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Enough for me that Jesus saves,
  This ends my fear and doubt;
A sinful soul I come to Him,
  He'll never cast me out.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">My heart is leaning on the Word,
  The written Word of God,
Salvation by my Savior's name,
  Salvation through His blood.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">My great Physician heals the sick,
  The lost He came to save;
For me His precious blood He shed,
  For me His life He gave.</stanza>
