    <stanza type="verse" number="1">All thy griefs by Him are ordered,
  Needful is each one for thee;
All thy tears by Him are counted,
  One too much there cannot be;
And if while they fall so quickly
  Thou canst own His way is right,
Then each bitter tear of anguish
  Precious is in Jesus' sight.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Far too well thy Savior loves thee
  To allow thy life to be
One long, calm, unbroken summer&amp;mdash;
  One unruffled, stormless sea;
He would have thee fondly nestling
  Closer to His loving breast,
He would have that day seem brighter
  When alone is perfect rest.</stanza>
