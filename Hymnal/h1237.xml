	<stanza type="verse" number="1">Splendid church life! His green garden!
He has brought us, praise the Lord,
To experience the Christ Who's growing here!
He is full of rich enjoyment
To His saints in one accord;
He is new and fresh, available and dear.</stanza>
	<stanza type="chorus" number="">I'm so happy in this lovely place,
In the garden growing in His grace!
There is no finer pleasure
Than to eat the living tree
And to get the living water into me.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">It is not a school or fact'ry
Or a chapel in the air;
But a garden where our Lord can plant and sow.
So He's placed us all here corporately
To be His garden fair,
Where He's free to cultivate and make us grow.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">Thus within the church-life garden
There's a fruit-producing tree
Full of life and so available to eat.
So be simple, don't be hardened,
Drop your concepts&amp;mdash;eat that tree!
Take in Jesus every moment&amp;mdash;He's so sweet!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">With the tree there is the water,
Flowing God in Christ to us,
Quenching all our dryness, ending all our strife.
Hallelujah! In His garden
Jesus flows Himself to us,
As the full supply for us to grow in life.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">Aren't you satisfied and thankful
That our Lord has brought you in
Where His pleasures and His riches flow so free?
So be happy and be joyful,
In the spirit feast on Him,
So God's garden can bear fruit abundantly.</stanza>
