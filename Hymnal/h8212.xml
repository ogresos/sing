    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Holy Spirit, a great wind,
From the heavens blows on us.
Just as on the multitude,
As you did on Pentecost!</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Holy Spirit blow on us!
Covering Spirit dwell on us.
Burn, O holy fire burn!
Your electrum in us shine,
By Your Spirit,
Radiate to all mankind.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Come Lord soften hardened hearts,
Our whole being to revive.
Blow until we are renewed,
Till all sins do fall aside.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">A great cloud the Spirit is,
To supply abundant grace.
As the cloud He covers us,
Just as the Tent of Meeting's place.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Covering Spirit give us life!
He's the power to sanctify.
Making us God's dwelling place
As in Spirit we abide.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Holy fire come and burn me!
All my being to consume.
Every part to purify,
That Your Spirit may have room.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Burn away all that's defiled;
All that's common has to go!
That I exactly like God am
All God's holiness to show.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Into me electrum shine!
Divine nature to partake.
With my spirit joined to God's,
Glowing life I'll radiate.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">Man with God now mingled is
The two natures joined as one.
God expressed in human form
Thus God's testimony's done!</stanza>
