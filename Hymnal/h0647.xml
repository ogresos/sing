    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Trust Him when thy wants are many;
  Trust Him when thy friends are few;
And the time of swift temptation
  Is the time to trust Him too.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Trust Him when thy soul is burdened
  With the sense of all its sin;
He will speak the word of pardon,
  He will make thee clean within.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Trust Him for the grace sufficient,
  Ever equal to thy need;
Trust Him always for the answer,
  When in His dear name you plead.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Trust Him for the grace to conquer,
  He is able to subdue;
Trust Him for the power for service;
  Trust Him for the blessing too.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Trust Him when dark doubts assail thee,
  Trust Him when thy strength is small,
Trust Him when to simply trust Him
  Seems the hardest thing of all.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Trust Him; He is ever faithful;
  Trust Him, for His will is best;
Trust Him, for the heart of Jesus
  Is the only place of rest.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Trust Him, then, through cloud or sunshine,
  All thy cares upon Him cast,
Till the storm of life is over,
  And the trusting days are past.</stanza>
