    <stanza type="verse" number="1">What! Not sing of blood divine?
What! Not tell to all mankind?
What! Not speak to hearts unclean
Of the precious living stream.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">By this blood, God's life released,
Blood surpassing any beast's;
Perfect, spotless Lamb of God,
Incorruptible His blood.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Voice it has, this holy blood;
Pow'r possessed to speak with God;
Speaks it for us at the throne
With its glorious virtue shown.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Failure on our conscience is&amp;mdash;
Conscience means a "knowing this"&amp;mdash;
Causing us much grief and pain,
Telling us of every stain.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">All the while we're unaware
Of the blood's effectual prayer.
Jesus' blood speaks of our case,
That we might receive His grace!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">We need not dead works to bring,
Nor another offering.
Nothing else could please our God,
Heav'n is listening for His blood.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">In His blood forgiveness shines;
Oh, 'tis glorious to find!
Israel just atonement knew,
We have that and cleansing too.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">Heart and mind are now at peace
Rest! Our conscience has been reached.
Never more we blush in shame,
We are washed from every stain.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="9">Hallelujah! Fathomless!
All that's in His blood for us!
Sing we will, and sing we must;
In His blood is all our trust!</stanza>
