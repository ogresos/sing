  <lyrics>
	<stanza type="verse" number="1">What a wonderful change in my life has been wrought
    Since Jesus came into my heart!
I have light in my soul for which long I had sought,
    Since Jesus came into my heart!</stanza>
	<stanza type="chorus" number="">Since Jesus came into my heart!
Since Jesus came into my heart!
Floods of joy o'er my soul like the sea billows roll,
  Since Jesus came into my heart!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">I have ceased from my wand'ring and going astray,
    Since Jesus came into my heart!
And my sins which were many are all washed away,
    Since Jesus came into my heart!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">I'm possessed of a hope that is steadfast and sure,
    Since Jesus came into my heart!
And no dark clouds of doubt now my pathway obscure,
    Since Jesus came into my heart!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">There's a light in the valley of death now for me,
    Since Jesus came into my heart!
And the gates of the City beyond I can see,
    Since Jesus came into my heart!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">I shall go there to dwell in that City I know,
    Since Jesus came into my heart!
And I'm happy, so happy as onward I go,
    Since Jesus came into my heart!</stanza>
