  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Himself He could not save,
  He on the cross must die,
Or mercy could not come
  To ruined sinners nigh;
Yes, Christ, the Son of God, must bleed,
That sinners might from sin be freed.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Himself He could not save,
  For justice must be done;
Our sins' full weight must fall
  Upon the sinless One;
For nothing less can God accept
In payment of that fearful debt.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Himself He could not save,
  For He the Surety stood
For all who now rely
  Upon His precious blood;
He bore the penalty of guilt
When on the cross His blood was spilt.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Himself He could not save,
  What wondrous love is this!
In love Himself He gave,
  There ne'er was love like His!
Such love should melt a heart of stone,
Till praise flows forth to Him alone!</stanza>
