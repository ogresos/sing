	<stanza type="verse" number="1">We're gathered here, O Lord, as Thy one Body:
Though we be many, yet we all are one.
We share Thy life and own that we are members,
And thus within, in life we all are one.</stanza>
	<stanza type="chorus" number="">There is one Body in this universe,
And we express it here on earth;
We stand as one in each locality
  For all to see, for all to see.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">There is one loaf, the symbol of Thy body:
'Twas broken so that all the saints may share.
We eat this bread and, as we are partaking,
Our actual oneness with all saints declare.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">One bread, one cup are now upon the table,
Showing that we can be naught else but one.
Christ has redeemed us, made us His own Body:
What can we say but, "Amen, Lord, we're one!"</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">We stand as one, and cannot be divided,
Because our oneness is of Christ alone.
We eat as one: one loaf, one cup partaking,
And thus our oneness visibly is shown.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">Oh, what a joy to have this blessed oneness!
We sense that Thou, O Lord, art satisfied;
And we too share this blissful satisfaction&amp;mdash;
Sweet foretaste of the Bridegroom with His Bride.</stanza>
