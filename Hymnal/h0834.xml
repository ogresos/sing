  <lyrics>
	<stanza type="verse" number="1">The chief Cornerstone Thou art, Lord,
  Jewish builders did despise;
God by resurrection placed Thee,
  Thou art precious in His eyes.
Through Thee we receive salvation,
  And, together built by Thee,
Jews and Gentiles are Thy dwelling,
  One new man, in harmony.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">Thou too art the smitten Rock, Lord,
  That man's thirst by Thee be filled,
That frail man may stand upon Thee,
  But e'en more, God's house to build.
The Foundation Stone in Zion,
  Tested and secure, Thou art;
And the Rock, the Church supporting,
  Her foundation to impart.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">On Thyself the Church is builded,
  And though many storms assail,
Still it stands erect, for 'gainst it
  Gates of hell cannot prevail.
Thine authority possessing,
  It doth bind and loose in Thee,
Bringing men into Thy kingdom,
  Satan's captives setting free.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">Living Stone of life art Thou, Lord,
  Precious, chosen thus to be;
Living stones Thou too hast made us,
  One in character with Thee.
Built together as a temple
  That our God may dwell therein,
Thus we are a holy priesthood,
  Offering sacrifice to Him.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">Lord, Thou art the Son of David
  That God's temple Thou may build;
King and Priest Thou art together,
  That Thy calling be fulfilled.
As the King, for God Thou rulest,
  Making men submit to Him;
As the Priest before God's presence,
  Bringing men to enter in.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">Thine authority doth issue
  From the throne to render peace;
Fellowship is in the river
  To supply and give increase.
When these, balanced, go together,
  Then God's purpose is fulfilled;
King and Priest in Thee combining,
  Thou God's dwelling place dost build.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">Thou art God, yet flesh becamest,
  God with man in Thee doth dwell;
Thou, the Temple for His glory,
  God in Thee Himself doth tell.
Thus the Church too is the mingling
  Into one of God and man;
So it is with every member
  For the building of God's plan.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="8">Thou, the everlasting Dwelling,
  In all ages art our home;
We in Thee enjoy protection,
  Living in Thyself alone.
Thou our Sanctuary art, Lord,
  We and God abide in Thee;
Thou, God's presence art within us,
  Where we worship ceaselessly.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="9">Cornerstone, Foundation, Topstone,
  Rock, and Church, and Living Stone,
Dwelling-place, and Sanctuary,
  Builder too art Thou, we own.
Praise we give for what Thou art, Lord,
  As Thy wondrousness we see!
Grant that we may be built up, Lord,
  As the living stones in Thee.</stanza>
