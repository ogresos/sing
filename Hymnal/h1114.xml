    <stanza type="verse" number="1">The Spirit today is the air that we breathe;
Our spirits rejoice in this living inflow.
For just as our body the breath does receive,
So also in spirit to live it is so.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">The Spirit today is the air that we breathe;
What thing more important than breathing to do?
For breathing each moment, new life we receive,
And God's living freshness is constant and new.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">For God has been processed, as air now, He's free;
This life-giving pneuma is all that we need.
He's rich and abundant, so plentiful, He,
In spirit to walk is to breathe Him indeed.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">O, say, aren't you glad that the Spirit's outpoured
And God, fully processed, is flowing in us?
So freely we're breathing this life-giving Lord,
And breathing, receiving His life, glorious!</stanza>
