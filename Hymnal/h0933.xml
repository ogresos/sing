  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">I have a Savior, He's pleading in glory,
A dear loving Savior, though earth-friends be few;
And now He is watching in tenderness o'er me,
But oh, that my Savior were your Savior too!</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">For you I am praying,
For you I am praying,
For you I am praying,
  I'm praying for you.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">I have a Father: to me He has given
A hope for eternity, blessed and true;
He'll call me one day to the kingdom of heaven,
But oh, that He'd let me bring you with me too!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">I have a peace: it is calm as a river,
A peace that the friends of this world never knew;
My Savior alone is its Author and Giver,
And oh, could I know it was given to you!</stanza>
