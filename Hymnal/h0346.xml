    <stanza type="verse" number="1">I am not skilled to understand
What God hath willed, what God hath planned;
I only know at His right hand
  Stands One who is my Savior.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">I take Him at His word indeed:
"Christ died for sinners"&amp;mdash;this I read;
For in my heart I find a need
  Of Him to be my Savior!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">That He should leave His place on high
And come for sinful man to die,
You count it strange? So once did I
  Before I knew my Savior!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">And, oh, that He fulfilled may see
The travail of His soul in me,
And with His work contented be,
  As I with my dear Savior!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Yes, living, dying, let me bring
My strength, my solace from this spring&amp;mdash;
That He who lives to be my King
  Once died to be my Savior!</stanza>
