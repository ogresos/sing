    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Dear Lord, how precious is Thy blood,
  Of the New Testament!
By it God's blessings we receive,
  And we with Him are blent.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">"Tis by Thy blood we've been redeemed,
  And by it sanctified.
Now is our conscience free from sin,
  From dead works purified.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Better than Abel's, now Thy blood
  Speaks unto God for us.
Perfect redemption it provides,
  Meeting God's righteousness.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Through the eternal Spirit, Thou
  Offeredst Thyself to God.
This sacrifice can ne'er grow old;
  Timeless is Thy dear blood.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">'Tis by Thy blood we boldly come
  Unto the throne of grace,
Unto our God, the cov'nant new,
  And to the Holiest Place.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Lord, by Thy blood, God is obliged
  His very Self to give;
He must receive us to Himself,
  And He in us must live.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Dear Lord, how precious is Thy blood
  Of the New Testament!
By it God's blessings we receive,
  And we with Him are blent.</stanza>
