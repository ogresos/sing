    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Christ comes quickly for His Bride,
Wedding feast He will provide,
Garments bright and pure supplied&amp;mdash;
  Dress in time!
Taking Christ as life she's dressed,
By much suffering stitched and pressed;
Righteous acts are thus possessed&amp;mdash;
  Dress in time!</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Be in time! Be in time!
For the marriage feast of Jesus
  Be in time!
If your soul life you deny
And the Spirit you apply,
Then you'll fully qualify&amp;mdash;
    Be in time!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Virgins Christ comes quickly for,
Those with oil an extra store,
Not the fools who oil ignore&amp;mdash;
  Buy in time!
For the oil a price we pay,
Deal with self without delay,
Fill your vessels every day&amp;mdash;
  Buy in time!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">For His servants Christ will come
And reward each faithful one;
Slothful ones will be undone&amp;mdash;
  Serve in time!
Make your single talent count,
All self's problems now surmount,
Serve with Christ, the living fount&amp;mdash;
  Serve in time!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Christ comes quickly for His grain,
Ripened firstfruits to obtain;
Unripe harvest will remain&amp;mdash;
  Ripen now!
From earth's water grain must dry,
From the world your soul deny;
To mature the self must die&amp;mdash;
  Ripen now!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Overcomers Christ will take,
Those who all for Him forsake,
Those who of first love partake&amp;mdash;
  Win in time!
All the deadness overcome,
With the living Christ be one,
Toward the goal now swiftly run&amp;mdash;
  Win in time!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Christ comes for His kingdom too;
Heav'nly reign we must pursue,
Let His rule our self subdue&amp;mdash;
  Yield in time!
Rebel self must be dethroned,
Lessons must not be postponed,
Quickly yield to Christ enthroned&amp;mdash;
  Yield in time!</stanza>
