    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Jesus from the tomb has come,
Death to Him could do no harm;
Comforted let us remain,
And together praise His name.
Now redemption's work is done,
All His foes He's overcome.
Once for all our sins He bore,
Now He'll suffer nevermore.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Hades, boulder, soldiers 'round,
None could harm or hold Him down;
Though He briefly suffered pain,
I eternal blessing gain.
He Who died must die no more,
Satan's scheming days are o'er;
Empty tomb is all we see,
Soon all graves shall empty be.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">From the grain of wheat that died,
Many grains were multiplied;
He no more alone abides,
All the church is at His side.
As His Body, with our Head,
To the heavens we ascend;
With Him buried, with Him soar,
Praise His name forevermore.</stanza>
