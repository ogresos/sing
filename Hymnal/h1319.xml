    <stanza type="verse" number="1">That which for long the prophets sought,
The righteous yearned to see,
Has in these last of days appeared
In its reality.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">And we're now in the final stages,
'Tis the completion of all the ages.
All those who believed the promise
  Are perfected now in us.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Oh, blessed are our eyes that see,
Our ears, how blessed to hear;
Things angels ne'er could look into
Are now to us made clear.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Our sense is corporate, bold and strong,
His grace, how free to take;
Encouraging the others on,
Run for the kingdom's sake.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">We're weary not this race to run,
It makes our joy complete;
For this we know, around the bend,
The Lord we'll surely meet.</stanza>
