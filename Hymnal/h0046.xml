    <stanza type="verse" number="1">O gracious God, Thy pleasure
  Is in Thy Christ made known,
And tells the boundless measure
  Of blessing for Thine own.
He has Thy presence entered,
  As Man in heav'n is known;
In Him Thy glory's centered,
  In Him Thy purpose shown.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">And O what love is beaming
  Refulgent in that face!
What blessed light is streaming
  From that most glorious place!
Both love and light proclaiming
  What Thou, the Father, art,
And wondrous grace revealing,
  With Thine own Son, our part.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Thou source of every blessing!
  Thou spring of all delight!
Thy Name with joy confessing
  Let all the saints unite!
Each heart its praise outpouring
  To Thee all praise above,
Each voice in strains adoring
  Re-echoes&amp;mdash;"God is love."</stanza>
