    <stanza type="verse" number="1">O God our Father, we would come to Thee
  In virtue of our Savior's precious blood;
All distance gone, our souls by grace set free,
  We worship Thee, our Father and our God.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">We would, O God, present before Thy face
  The fragrant name of Thy beloved Son;
By faith we view Him through Thy boundless grace,
  Which, by His dying, He for us has won.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Thy joy in Him who is with Thee we share;
  Our hearts delight in Thy delight in Him;
Chiefest of thousands, fairer than the fair;
  His glory nought can tarnish, nought can dim.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">We bow in worship now before Thy throne,
  By faith the Object of Thy love would see;
Who, in the midst, His brethren's song doth lead.
  To Him, our Savior, shall the glory be!</stanza>
