    <stanza type="verse" number="1">We limit not the truth of God
  To our poor reach of mind,
By notions of our day and sect,
  Crude, partial and confined.
Now let a new and better hope
  Within our hearts be stirred:
The Lord hath yet more light and truth
  To break forth from His Word.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Who dares to bind by his dull sense
  The oracles of heaven,
For all the nations, tongues and climes
  And all the ages given!
The universe how much unknown!
  That ocean unexplored!
The Lord hath yet more light and truth
  To break forth from His Word.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Darkling our great forefathers went
  The first steps of the way;
'Twas but the dawning yet to grow
  Into the perfect day;
And grow it shall, our glorious Sun
  More fervid rays afford:
The Lord hath yet more light and truth
  To break forth from His Word.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">The valleys past, ascending still,
  Our souls would higher climb,
And look down from supernal heights,
  On all the bygone times;
Upward we press, the air is clear,
  And the sphere-music heard!
The Lord hath yet more light and truth
  To break forth from His Word.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">O Father, Son and Spirit, send
  Us increase from above;
Enlarge, expand all Christian hearts
  To comprehend Thy love;
And make us all go on to know
  With nobler powers conferred:
The Lord hath yet more light and truth
  To break forth from His Word.</stanza>
