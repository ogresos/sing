    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Oh, the Lord is quickly coming,
He has spoken in His Word;
And confirmed it by the churches,
For His Spirit we have heard.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Not to all the seven churches
Did the Lord speak in this way;
To the church in Philadelphia
Did He choose these words to say.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Philadelphia, Philadelphia,
Church so full of brotherly love,
You're the church to bring the Bridegroom
Back to earth from heav'n above.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">He that hath the key of David,
He that shuts and opens too,
Knows thy works, O Philadelphia;
That's why you're His Bride so true.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Not so strong by worldly standards,
Hidden from religion's fame;
Jesus loves you, Philadelphia,
For you're faithful to His name.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">By His Word you're overcoming&amp;mdash;
How the Amen does resound!
Just hold fast to what you've gotten,
That no man may take your crown.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">You have kept His Word of patience;

He will keep you from that hour
Which upon the whole world cometh
When the Lord comes in His power.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">"I come quickly," Philadelphia,
Speaks the Lord to none but you;
"Amen! Quickly come, Lord Jesus,"
Answer back His faithful few.</stanza>
