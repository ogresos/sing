    <stanza type="verse" number="1">O Lord, how rich Thou art to us,
  Thy love reveals the measure!
The boundless riches of Thyself,
  In spirit here we treasure.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Thou art the Word, e'en God Himself,
  With God in the beginning;
Incarnate in the flesh with us,
  And God to us defining.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Thou art the tabernacle true,
  In Thee we see God's glory;
For God Thou art the temple too,
  In Thee is God's full story.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Thou art the only Son of God,
  The Father e'er declaring,
That we may have the life divine.
  God's very nature sharing.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Thou art the Son of Man like us,
  And truly share our nature,
That we may be the sons of God
  And grow to Thy full stature.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Thou art the Christ, the Lord of all,
  By God Thou art anointed;
The One who is the All in all,
  For God and us appointed.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Thou art the Savior crucified,
  Whence issued blood and water,
That we might be redeemed to God,
  And life divine may enter.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">Thou now art Jesus glorified,
  From whom descends the Spirit;
The all-inclusive Spirit comes
  To us with all Thy merit.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="9">Thou art the very light of life
  That shineth in the darkness;
The light divine that shines with God
  Within our hearts in fulness.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="10">Thou art the very life divine,
  Which all our spirits quickens;
The life which brings us out of death
  And all our being strengthens.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="11">Lord, Thou art God's reality,
  The truth that meets God's pleasure;
The truth that brings Thyself to us,
  That we may know Thy measure.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="12">Thou also art the way of life,
  Which unto glory leads us;
The way of Thy reality,
  Which into vict'ry speeds us.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="13">Thou art the resurrection too,
  All death Thy life doth swallow;
'Tis by Thy resurrection pow'r,
  We bear the cross and follow.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="14">Thou art the spotless Lamb of God,
  Who died for our redemption;
Thou art the Spirit-giver too,
  For our regeneration.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="15">Thou art the serpent made of brass,
  Who saveth us from evil;
Thou on the tree wast lifted up,
  To crush for us the devil.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="16">Thou art the Shepherd and the door,
  For us to leave the sheepfold,
By Thee we have full liberty
  And share the pasture freehold.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="17">Thy washing keeps us always clean,
  In function like the laver;
Thus we are kept in fellowship,
  Partaking of Thy favor.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="18">Thou art the heav'nly riven rock,
  With living water flowing;
We drink of this refreshing stream,
  Thy quenching power knowing.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="19">Thou art the heav'nly well, in Thee
  Is living water ever;
We drink of Thine eternal life,
  And thirst no more forever.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="20">Thou art the heav'nly bread of life,
  Thy food divine doth flourish;
With all Thy riches bountiful
  Our spirits Thou dost nourish.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="21">Thou even art our breath of life
  Thyself we breathe in spirit;
By Thee we live, in Thee we walk,
  Thy riches we inherit.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="22">Thou art the grain of wheat divine,
  That died and rose with glory,
To bring forth us as many grains
  To form Thy glorious Body.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="23">Thou art the true and heav'nly vine,
  And we in Thee are branches;
In Thee abiding, Thou in us,
  We share in all Thy riches.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="24">Thou art the Bridegroom from above
  To take the Bride, Thy Body;
That we may be with Thee as one,
  In life and love and glory.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="25">Thou art the ladder Jacob saw,
  By Thee the heav'n is open;
In Thee we are the house of God,
  And earth is joined to heaven.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="26">O Lord, Thou art the great "I AM,"
  Who all our need doth furnish;
Enjoying Thee as all in all,
  God's purpose we accomplish.</stanza>
