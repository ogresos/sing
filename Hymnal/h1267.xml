    <stanza type="verse" number="1">We are for the great migration,
And, O Lord, we seek Thy face.
Who? and when? and where? Lord Jesus,
Grant us now Thy blessed grace.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">This is for Thy house and city,
This is for Thy kingdom, Lord;
To subdue the earth before us
We are all in one accord.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Of the Father, through Christ Jesus,
By the Spirit's flowing free;
In our spirit, on the church-ground&amp;mdash;
This the way of victory.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Burden us with Thy great plan, Lord;
Consecrated we would be.
To fulfill Thy holy purpose
Saturate us thoroughly.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Build, O build us all together,
Let us here our lessons learn,
Send us forth to many cities
For the church-life there to burn.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Many places need a beachhead
To bring in Thy reign and rule.
Lord, build up the local churches
That Thy kingdom come in full!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Then the earth will give Thee glory
And the devil get the shame.
For Thy kingdom's rule and reigning
All will praise Thy glorious name.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">Blessed days are quickly coming;
We rejoice and give Thee praise
For the glorious consummation
And Thy royal ruling days.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="9">Hallelujah to the Father,
Hallelujah to the Son,
Hallelujah to the Spirit&amp;mdash;
Hallelujah, it is done!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="10">Hallelujah for the churches,
Hallelujah for the saints,
Hallelujah for the meetings
And their holy, sweet constraints!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="11">Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Hallelujah we will sing;
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Hallelujah to our King!</stanza>
