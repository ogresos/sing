    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Had not my Substitute returned,
How could my heart its fears restrain?
Was He implicated in my sin?
Unable to save, instead detained?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Could it be He could not forgive
My sins so great, so numerous?
Could His dear blood be limited
In scope and in effectiveness?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Rejoice! For Jesus rose again
Not harmed, but further glorified;
Though He passed through the dark domain,
All its effect He nullified.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">God's righteousness is satisfied
By Christ's return, this fact's made known.
From God's great love, His mercy's shown,
The Lord's redeeming work is done.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Redemption's work God recognized,
Gave proof by resurrecting Christ;
Oh, Hallelujah! No more stain!
Hallelujah! Full pardon gained!</stanza>
