  <lyrics>
        <stanza type="verse" number="">Christ is everything for God's building,
And as the engraved stone with seven eyes,
The topstone of grace,
Christ is everything for God's building,
And as the engraved stone with seven eyes,
The topstone of grace,
He is now transfusing what He is
And what He has accomplished
He is now transfusing what He is
And what He has accomplished
Into our being
So that, by becoming the same as He is
In life and nature
But not in the Godhead,
We may be His reproduction
For the building of the temple of God.</stanza>
