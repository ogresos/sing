    <stanza type="verse" number="1">I am young and I'm in love
With the One Who is from above.
All my days are just for Him.
All my being I open to Him.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Jesus, You love me.
You took my place in Calvary.
Jesus, You love me.
You gave Your life to save me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Others try the world and sin,
But for me &amp;mdash; I only want Him.
Lord Your beauty has captured my heart.
Now I give You every part.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Jesus, I love You;
No other one compares to You.
Jesus, I love You;
My all and life I give to You.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Jesus now is living in me.
We'll be mingled as one entity.
God's good pleasure His Bride we'll be
As His wife for eternity.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Hallelujah! We're in love!
God loving us and we love Him.
Hallelujah! We're in love!
His masterpiece the New Jerusalem.</stanza>
