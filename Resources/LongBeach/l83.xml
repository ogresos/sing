    <stanza type="verse" number="1">All my life I searched for God
For joy and peace and happiness
I prayed to idols on my knees
But "my life summed up" was hopelessness.
My hope was gone, I'm all alone.
I'm facing death, darkness and gloom
I had no joy or happiness
But fear with emptiness.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">My doctor and my children too
They tried their best to take me through
But none could heal my inward part
So let me die with a broken heart.
My hope was gone, I'm all alone
I'm facing death, darkness and gloom
I had no joy or happiness
But fear with emptiness.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">When death came knocking at my door
I knew my life would be no more
It's then, Lord Jesus, You came in
Your love and light came beaming in.
My hope was gone, I'm all alone
I'm facing death, darkness and gloom
That's when You came with compassion
Jesus&amp;mdash;Praise to Your name.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Your blood cleansed me, Your love touched me
I called Your name, Your life filled me
And now I'm full of joy and peace
You're now my life and happiness.
Oh, rising Sun, in me You shined
And now I know, Jesus You're mine
Your shining face makes my heart sing
With healing in Your wings.</stanza>
