    <stanza type="verse" number="1">It is God's commandment and desire
That His people call on Him
And it is the joyful way to drink
From the fount of God's salvation.
Yes, this is a joyful way
To delight oneself in Him.
God becomes our enjoyment
Just by calling on His precious name.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Calling Him is not a new practice
In the New Testament.
It began way back in Genesis,
And throughout the Old Testament.
Enosh, Job, and Abraham&amp;mdash;
All these ones called on Him.
Moses, Samuel, and David&amp;mdash;
And many others did the same.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">It is such a jubilant practice
That Joel prophesied.
And this was fulfilled at Pentecost,
So Peter testified:
All who call upon the name
Of the Lord shall be saved.
All who call upon the name
Of the Lord Jesus shall be saved.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">God outpoured His Spirit on all flesh
For the application
Of His rich salvation to all men,
But we must call upon Him.
Calling brings the Jubilee;
Jesus comes to you and me.
Calling sets the captives free;
We're enjoying God in liberty.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Calling was a major practice then
By the early Christians.
It became a popular sign
Of Christ's believers then.
Yes, this is a joyful way
To delight oneself in Him.
God becomes enjoyable
Just by calling on His precious name.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Calling is opposed as it was then
By the camp of religion.
But His witnesses kept calling Him:
They weren't stopped by opposition.
We must be like Stephen then;
Jesus was his everything.
Even while they martyred him,
He was calling on the highest name.</stanza>
