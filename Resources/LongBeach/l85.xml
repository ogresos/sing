    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Saints, if we do not love Christ
Then we surely cannot live Him.
Loving Him is the best way
To concentrate our being on Him.
(Repeat)</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Living Christ is by loving Him,
Living Christ is by loving Him,
Living Christ is by loving Him,
To concentrate our being on Him.
(Repeat)</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Loving Christ to the uttermost
And taking Him, saints, as our foremost.
Let's occupy our entire being,
Yes, absolutely on Him.
(Repeat)</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Loving Christ to the uttermost,
Taking Him as your foremost.
Living Christ is by loving Him,
Lord, wholly occupy my being.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Loving Christ to the uttermost,
Taking Him as your foremost.
Living Christ is by loving Him,
Lord, wholly occupy my entire being.</stanza>
