    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Where's the answer? There must be more for me.
Is this all to life&amp;mdash;an empty vanity?
Day by day and year by year go by.
Am I just a man, a man just born to die?</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Where's the answer? Oh I'm so empty
And plagued by this vanity.
Deep inside me, My conscience tells me:
I need another destiny.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">I convinced my friends that everything's alright,
That my life and future and everything's so bright.
But a sense inside me, my friends, I can't deny,
Warning deep inside me that I was living a lie.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Where's the answer? Oh I'm so empty
And plagued by this vanity.
Deep inside me, My conscience tells me:
I need another destiny.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">The world and its glitter left me anxious, dark, and bitter,
Always yearning, my friends, is there something better?
And religion, my friends, is just a Sunday game&amp;mdash;
Dead teachings and doctrines will leave you just the same.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Where's the answer? Oh I'm so empty
And plagued by this vanity.
Deep inside me, My conscience tells me:
I need another destiny.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Oh God, where are You? I need You desperately!
Oh God, who are You? Why don't You answer me?
The heavens declare You and the earth shows Your beauty.
But I'm a man. Oh God, I'm so empty!</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Lord, have mercy! I'm crying for You!
Please hear! Are you really true?
I'm dark and lonely. You're far, far from me.
Oh Lord, I need You desperately!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">One day a friend told me that Jesus is the Lord.
To my great surprise, it's written in the Word.
They asked me to believe You. Your name I once blasphemed.
Dear Lord, You saved me just by calling on Your name.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Oh, Lord Jesus, dear Son, so glorious,
I'm cleansed and You entered into me.
Oh, Lord Jesus, Your name most precious!
Your Person, dear Lord, I now possess.</stanza>
