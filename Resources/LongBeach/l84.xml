    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Lord Jesus I need You
More than I needed You before.
Lord Jesus I love You
More than I loved You before.
Lord Jesus I treasure You
More than I treasured You before.
Lord Jesus I need You.
I love and treasure&amp;mdash;only You.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Lord Jesus I need You
More than I needed You before.
Without You, Lord, I would be through;
I would collapse apart from You.
Your presence is my everything.
You are the greatest blessing.
Lord Jesus I need You.
I love and treasure&amp;mdash;only You.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Lord Jesus I love You
More than I loved You before.
You first loved me and died for me;
Your dying love has conquered me.
One look at You hanging on a tree;
You loved me, Lord, so utterly.
Lord Jesus I need You.
I love and treasure&amp;mdash;only You.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Lord Jesus I treasure You
More than I treasured You before.
You dwell in me, priceless One to be
So near and dear subjectively.
Lord Jesus You're one with me;
We're mingled for eternity.
Lord Jesus I need You.
I love and treasure&amp;mdash;only You.</stanza>
