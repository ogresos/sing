  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Before we were saved, we were alone.
Though so many others were with us,
In fact we were still by ourselves, alone.
Once we got saved we could never again
    Be alone by ourselves;
Someone has come, now wherever we go
    And whatever we do,
    Jesus is here.
Always this other Person stays with us.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Sometimes we are pleased that He remains.
We love Him and cherish Him, yet there
Are times that we secretly wish He'd go.
This One, however our Christ we could
    Never escape or evade.
Though we would tell Him to just go away
    And to leave us alone,
    Jesus won't leave.
It is impossible to be alone.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">We're single no more; now we are two.
Formerly we were just one by
Ourselves, but now Christ wants to be our life.
Once we got saved we could never again
    Be alone by ourselves;
Someone has come, now wherever we go
    And whatever we do,
    Jesus is here.
Always this other Person stays with us.
He is our life.</stanza>
