  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Deep in God's heart there's been,
Before the time began,
God's desire to be expressed,
This He planned in eternal past.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">God eternal had a purpose
In eternal past.
He created man in His image
that man would God express.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Genesis, the blueprint &amp;mdash;
Revelation, the fulfillment &amp;mdash;
From God's plan and economy
To the city in eternity.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Man from the dust of the ground
At the end, New Jerusalem.
Here God's wisdom and love abound.
Oh! This is most profound!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Deep in God's heart He planned
To mingle Himself with man.
God, as a river and a tree,
Man's food and drink to be.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">God our enjoyment
Issues the fulfillment:
A city as His expression
Built with gold, pearl and precious stones.</stanza>
