  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Lord, I love You more and more each day.
Lord, I love You more this very day.
I can't live without You anymore.
I can't make it like I did before.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Oh, those years when I was void of You.
Lord, You rescued me when I was through.
When I reminisce those other years,
Emptiness, heartaches, and many tears.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Lord, I do love You more everyday.
Lord, I do love You much more this very day.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Oh, that thirst that gnawed me deep within:
Drove me seeking satisfaction.
Oh, the many things that I have tried:
Left me thirsting and dissatisfied.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">In this endless search for something new,
All the time this cry was just for You.
I was blind in trying many things
'Til I drank You as my living Spring.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Lord, You came and filled my inmost  being.
You're the sweetest satisfaction.
You're the Spirit as my everything,
Spirit in my spirit bubbling.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Thank You, Lord, for coming into me.
Now You're spreading in me constantly.
Lord, You're making home in all my heart,
As my treasure filling every part.</stanza>
