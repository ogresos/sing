  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">O God of glory,
You've changed my destiny.
Oh Lord, Your mercy
In love appeared to me.

O God of glory,
You have attracted me!
My heart responds to Thee
And turns spontaneously.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">O God of glory,
You have appeared to me.
Dear Lord, Your beauty,
My God, has captured me!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">In darkness once I groped,
A person with no hope.
But light in darkness shined,
My heart enlightened.

You came to me as Light
And shattered all my night.
Your glory, what a sight!
You made me, Lord, so bright.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">To You my heart was drawn,
It wasn't on my own.
Your beauty made me turn
And caused my heart to burn.

You touched my hardened heart
And softened every part.
I saw Your shining face.
Now nothing can erase.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">I couldn't, Lord, believe,
But, Lord, You still appeared.
Your life in me conceived,
Dear Lord, I now believe.

You called not being as being
In me conceiving.
Your life transfusing,
I'm now reacting.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">O God of glory,
You're now my story.
Dear One, I can't refuse!
By You, I've been transfused.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Like father Abraham,
To You, dear Lord, he ran.
Your glory has infused,
Dear Lord, we can't refuse.

You came to fallen man
As, Lord, the Great I Am.
In us dispensing
The blessing to mankind.</stanza>
