    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Brothers' part:
Whom have I in heaven but Thee?
And there's none upon the earth that I
   desire beside Thee.
Whom have I in heaven but Thee?
And there's none upon the earth that I
   desire beside Thee.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">My flesh and my heart faileth.
But God is the strength of my heart
And my portion forever.
   (Repeat 2)</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Nevertheless, I am continually with Thee;
Thou hast holden me by my right hand;
Thou shalt guide me with Thy counsel and
Afterwards receive me to glory.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">One thing have I desired of the Lord;
That will I seek after,
That I may dwell in the house of the Lord.
   (Repeat 4)</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">I may dwell in the house of the Lord,
All the days of my life,
To behold the beauty of the Lord
And to inquire in His temple.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Sisters' part:
I am continually with Thee;
Thou hast beholden me by my right hand.
I am continually with Thee;
Thou hast holden me by my right hand.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">He is my refuge
And my fortress;
My God, in Him will I trust.
   (Repeat 2)</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">I have set the Lord
Always before me;
He is at my right hand;
I shall not be moved.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Blessed are they
That dwell in the house;
They will be praising Thee all the day long.
   (Repeat 4)</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">There is a river
Whose streams make glad
The city of our God.
God is in the midst of her.</stanza>
