    <stanza type="verse" number="1">In His shadow have I rapture and sit down;
And His fruit is sweet to my taste.
He hath brought me to the house of wine,
And His banner over me is love.
Sustain Ye me with raisin cakes,
Refresh me with apples;
For I am sick with love.
His left hand is under my head,
And His right hand doth embrace me.</stanza>
