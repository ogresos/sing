  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">A lover of Christ should be one
Who's attracted by His love
And drawn by His sweetness
To pursue after Him, pursue after Him,
Pursue Him for full satisfaction.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">A lover of Christ should be one
Who is called by Him
To be delivered
From the self through His oneness
With the cross, with the cross of Christ.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">A lover of Christ should be one
Who is called by Him to live in ascension
As the new creation, creation of God,
In the resurrection of Christ.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">A lover of Christ should be one
Who's called by Him more strongly to live within
The veil, thru His cross after the lover's
Experience of His resurrection.</stanza>
