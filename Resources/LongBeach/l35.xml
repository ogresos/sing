    <stanza type="verse" number="1">When we are with unveiled face
Beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord,
He infuses us with the elements
Of what He is and of what He has done.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">But we all with unveiled face,
Beholding and reflecting
Like a mirror the glory of the Lord,
Are being transformed
Into the same image
From glory to glory,
Even as from the Lord Spirit.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Thus we are being transformed
Metabolic'lly to have His life-shape
By His life-pow'r with His life-essence,
Transfigured by renewing our mind.</stanza>
