    <stanza type="verse" number="1">The Son with the Father by the Spirit&amp;mdash;
O what a mystery!
The fulness of all the Godhead
Dwells in Him bodily.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Wonderful One, Son with the Father,
Wonderful One, Son by the Spirit,
Wonderful Jesus Christ,
Wonderful Triune, Wonderful Triune God.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">The Son with the Father by the Spirit,
Conceived in a virgin's womb
The issue: a God-man, a wonderful Person,
Jesus divine and human.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Wonderful One, Son with the Father,
Wonderful One, Son by the Spirit,
Wonderful Jesus Christ,
Wonderful Triune, Wonderful Triune God.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">This man in perfection chose God as His living;
He lived the life of God.
The sin, world, and Satan could not penetrate Him;
Jesus had sinless blood.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Humanity, His blood has cleansed me.
Divinity, my guarantee.
His sinless blood cleansed me.
God's now my guaran&amp;mdash;, God's now my guarantee.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">His flesh without sin joined man's flesh full of sin
And this trapped Satan.
Man's flesh, sin and Satan were hanging upon Him
O what a termination!</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Terminating, the old creation,
Penetrating, flesh, sin and Satan.
O what a promised seed!
He crushed the Devil's, He crushed the Devil's head.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">And in resurrection, this wonderful Person
The Spirit He became.
The Spirit right now is the Son with the Father
To be the consummation.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Wonderful One, life-giving Spirit!
Son has become the consummation.
Son with the Father, He
As Spirit dwells in, as Spirit dwells in me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">And in His ascension, this wonderful Person,
This man is on God's throne.
The highest position, to Him it was given,
He's ruling and reigning.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">As Lord of lords and King of kings,
The highest name to Jesus given.
This man is on God's throne.
Most wonderful, most wonderful Person!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">And in His enthronement as Head over all things
The processed God is He,
Dispensing Himself as the life-giving Spirit,
Producing His Body.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">The Triune God is not for doctrine.
The Trinity is for dispensing.
He's now dispensing
And we're enjoying, and we're enjoying Him.</stanza>
