  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">I love You,
Always and forever more,
For in darkness where I lived in death
You showed Your light to me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Yes, I love You,
And that is what You are,
For this love You suffered death for me
And the world to be redeemed.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Though I'm worth no more than dust,
In Your eyes I am prized.
Your mercy purchased me
From my sin and my death.
You are love, You are love.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">I love You,
I give my all to You,
All my mind, my heart and all my strength
I'll offer all to You.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Lord, I love You,
And now You live in me,
Oh Lord, strengthen me to take my cross
To follow You each day.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Now I learn to call Your name.
Oh, Your riches come in
As my grace, reality,
My life and destiny.
You are love, You are love.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="">Though my sins are colored scarlet,
You have cleansed them white as snow;
With Your blood poured out on Calvary,
My redemption will always be.
Lord, I need You and You'll always be
My life through eternity.
Lord, I love You. Yes, I love You.
I always will love You.</stanza>
