The power and riches and wisdom and strength

    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Worthy is the Lamb
Who has been slained to receive
The power and riches

And the blessing.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Worthy is the Lamb Who has been slain to receive
The power and riches and wisdom and strength
And honor and glory and blessing.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Saints, stand as one;
No one should backward turn.
The battle Christ has won,
By His blood we overcome,
The enemy cast down
For the Lamb is on the throne.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb
And by the word of their testimony,
And they love not their soul-lives unto death.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Praise You, Lion-Lamb
Our Captain of salvation.
You have fought the battle
And destroyed the Devil.
You took away our sins
And accomplished redemption.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Hallelujah to our Lamb God on the throne!
Hallelujah Praise Him! Hallelujah
Hallelujah Praise Him! Hallelujah</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Lord, I join Your fight.
For Your purpose take my rights!
To You, I now respond,
In this age to overcome,
To the end make me fight on.
Fight on, fight on, fight on!</stanza>
