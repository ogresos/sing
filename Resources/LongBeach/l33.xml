  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">My heart was far from You.
My worship was not true.
My lips were honoring Thee
But I was so empty.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Lord, help me! Have mercy!
Lord, now deliver me!
All else is vanity.
You are reality!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Traditions are a lie.
Mere practice can't satisfy.
No matter how hard you try
Inside you feel so dry.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Lord water me! I'm so thirsty!
I come to drink of Thee.
You are the Spirit of life
To free me from all strive.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">The doctrines and the creeds
Have never met my needs.
The letters have killed me dead
My need is Living Bread.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Lord, feed me! I'm so hungry!
I come to eat of Thee.
Your Person now I can take.
The Living Word partake.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">I need You desperately
To get You into me!
I drink You as the Spirit, Lord,
And eat You in the Word.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">I'm satisfied! And You're testified!
There is no lack in Thee.
You are the river and the tree,
My feast eternally.</stanza>
