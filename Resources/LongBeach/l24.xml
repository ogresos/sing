    <stanza type="verse" number="1">God is man's treasure.
He is man's joy and pleasure.
God is man's treasure.
He is man's joy and pleasure.
God placed man in paradise,
Right in front of the tree of life.
If man would eat the tree of life,
He surely would be so satisfied.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Saints, beware the knowledge tree
Appearing so good; it's even pretty.
Its evil and good will open your eyes.
Its issue, my friend: you'll surely die.
The serpent, he crept in,
Injected in man his death and sin.
Man was seduced this knowledge to take.
My friend, that was the greatest mistake.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Look, dear saints, in eternity!
There's just a river and a tree!
It's life, life abundantly &amp;mdash;
Eating and drinking our destiny.
God's growing and flowing.
We're eating and drinking.
God is our treasure.
He is our joy and pleasure.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Christ is the tree of life
Eating Him always satisfies.
Christ is the river
Drink Him, our joy and pleasure.
Eat Him and drink Him,
Christ our enjoyment.
God is our treasure.
He is our joy and pleasure.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Dear saints, just love Him.
Surely you will enjoy Him.
He is so enjoyable,
So precious and so available.
Our God is dispensing
His life into us, so refreshing.
He is so enjoyable,
So precious and so available.</stanza>
