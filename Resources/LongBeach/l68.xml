  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">If there is no resurrection,
God would be God of the dead;
Christ Himself would not be living,
Ne'er have been raised from the dead.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">But there is a resurrection
Which is the vitality,
Both the life pulse and the lifeline
Within God's economy.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">If there is no resurrection,
Christ a Savior dead would be,
Not the One Who lives forever,
Who can save most utterly.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">If there is no resurrection,
There would be no living proof,
No proof that justification
Was accomplished by Christ's death.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">If there is no resurrection,
Life imparting would be stayed.
And so would regeneration
With renewing pass away.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">If there is no resurrection,
Then whatever would there be?
There would be no transformation,
Nor to Christ conformity.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">If there is no resurrection,
Where the members of the Christ?
There to Him would be no Body,
Which His fullness is in life.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">If there is no resurrection,
Then the church ne'er have been
Which is both to Christ His dear bride
And to God the one new man.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">If there is no resurrection,
Then would be God's economy,
With the voiding of His purpose,
In collapse fall totally.</stanza>
