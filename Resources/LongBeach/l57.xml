  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Where have you laid Him, my Jesus?
Where have you put Him, my precious Lord?
There are His grave clothes, but He's not there.
Where is my Jesus, my lovely One, where is He?</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Lord, I can't forget
Since the day we first met.
All my heart belongs to You.
I just love You, just You,
Just love You.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Jesus, my dear Lord, I love You.
I can't go on Lord, without You.
I'm sick of love, my soul has failed;
I need You Jesus, my Beloved, I love You.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Mary, My seeker, I am alive.
Stop, do not touch Me, as I have not
Yet ascended to the Father,
For this freshness is for the Father's enjoyment.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">My dear Rabboni, my heart's desire,
You have risen out of the grave.
O Lord, I love You, my dearest One.
You've truly risen from among the dead.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Dear Rabboni,
Lord, I can't believe it's You!
I don't know how this could be
But I enjoy You here.
I love You!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">O Lord, my heart is filled with ecstasy
In resurrection, to be here with Thee.
I am elated, beside myself.
Jesus, I'll love You with all my heart, forever.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Go tell my brothers you have seen Me.
Tell them the words which I speak to you:
I must ascend to My Father
And to your Father, and to My God
   and to your God.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">I have found my Love,
He has risen from the dead.
Now our Jesus is alive.
I have seen Him, seen Him!
I love Him!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Jesus, we love You with all our heart.
Our Love, we need You so desperately.
O Lord, we love You immensely.
We will be loving You for all eternity.</stanza>
