Surpassing everything.
Lovely Jesus, precious Jesus!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">My friend, I can't explain...
How excellent His name!
Lovely Jesus, precious Jesus!
His name of greatest worth,
As ointment sweet, poured forth.
Lovely Jesus, precious Jesus!</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">The cup of salvation

Oh, He is rich to all.
Don't wait; it's time to call.
Drink in Jesus, precious Jesus.</stanza>

Thank You Savior, precious Savior!
Your sins He took away;
Don't wait another day.
Precious Savior, full of mercy!</stanza>

Impossible it seems.
But nothing's hard for Him.
Call on Jesus, He will save you!</stanza>

Just call He's everywhere.

Your Person I would gain,
Oh Lord Jesus, precious Jesus!</stanza>
