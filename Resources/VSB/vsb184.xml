    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Do you not know that those who run,
Run on a racecourse, all run,
All run, but one receives the prize?
Run in this way, that you may lay hold.
And everyone who contends exercises
Self-control in all things; those therefore,
That they may receive a corruptible crown,
But we receive an incorruptible.</stanza>
