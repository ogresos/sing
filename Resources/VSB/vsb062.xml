    <stanza type="verse" number="1">I have a Friend, whose faithful love
Is more than all the world to me:
'Tis higher than the heights above,
And deeper than the soundless sea;
    So old, so new,
    So strong, so true;
Before the earth received its frame,
He loved me&amp;mdash;Blessed be His name!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">He held the highest place above,
Adored by all the sons of flame,
Yet such His self-denying love,
He laid aside His crown and came
    To seek the lost,
    And at the cost
Of heavenly rank and earthly fame
He sought me&amp;mdash;Blessed be His name!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">It was a lonely path He trod,
From every human soul apart;
Known only to Himself and God
Was all the grief that filled His heart,
    Yet from the track
    He turned not back,
Till where I lay in want and shame,
He found me&amp;mdash;Blessed be His name!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Then dawned at last that day of dread,
When desolate, yet undismayed,
With wearied frame and thorn-crowned head,
He, God-forsaken, man-betrayed,
    Was then made sin
    On Calvary,
And, dying there in grief and shame,
He saved me&amp;mdash;Blessed be His name!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Long as I live my song shall tell
The wonders of His dying love;
And when at last I go to dwell
With Him His sovereign grace to prove,
    My joy shall be
    His face to see,
And bowing there with loud acclaim
I'll praise Him&amp;mdash;Blessed be His name!</stanza>
