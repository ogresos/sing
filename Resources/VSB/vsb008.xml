    <stanza type="verse" number="1">The gift of righteousness is measured in abundance,
The depth of His love I'll never understand.
His love reaches me and you;
His mercy goes farther too.
The One on the throne of God is called the Lamb.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">So, why not open up and call His name, "Oh Lord!"
Find your spirit where His grace has been outpoured.
Call His name, taste His grace, exercise before His face
He's longing and yearning.
He's hoping and waiting.
He's ever desiring for you...
To turn to Him.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">He knows your deepest thought,
   Your every situation.
He understands your heart,
He knows your history.
There's nothing in His way,
He's just waiting for you to say
"Lord Jesus, my wandering heart
   I give to Thee."</stanza>
