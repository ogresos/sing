    <stanza type="verse" number="1">I do not know where they have laid Him.
The stone is taken away from the tomb.
Oh! They have taken Him away!
Oh! Where is He?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Disciples came and saw the empty tomb
But went away so soon to their own homes.
They're satisfied with just the facts.
But where's my Lord?</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Where is He, my Jesus?
Where is He, my Beloved?
Where is He Whom my soul doth love?
Jesus, my Love, I just want You.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">My heart is broken from my deepest need.
Don't ask me, angels, why I'm weeping.
Nothing but Jesus fills my inner being.
Oh! Where's my Love?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Someone is standing right behind me.
It's just the gardener I can barely see.
Sir, if you carried Him away...
Oh! Where is He?</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Where is He my Jesus?
Where is He my Beloved?
Tell me where you have laid Him
And I'll carry Him away, I'll carry Him away.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">And then I heard a voice say, "Mary."
That sweetest voice that penetrated me.
It is the voice of my Beloved,
Jesus, my Love.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">I have found my Jesus!
I have found my Beloved!
I have found Whom my soul doth love,
Jesus, my love, I just love You!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">But Jesus told me not to touch Him yet.
He must ascend first to the Father
And to My Father and your Father
To My God and your God.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Go and tell My brothers,
I ascend to the Father
To My Father and your Father,
And My God and your God, go tell My brothers.</stanza>
