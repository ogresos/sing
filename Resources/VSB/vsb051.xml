  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Lord, there's always been one person
Like Abraham who ran to meet You.
Samuel, he ministered
And David had a heart full of praise,
But You want many more.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Lord, we want to be that people
That minister and refresh You,
Meet Your need, and wash Your feet,
That satisfy Your heart's desire
And be a friend to You.
What can we do?</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">We can call O Lord,
We can praise Your name,
Turn our heart to You,
Let You rule and reign.
Lord, a single heart that's true,
That's what we desire.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Lord, You've shown You're rich in mercy
To those saints who stand together
In Your plan, one new man.
So grant us all a single heart;
A heart that just loves You
A heart that's true.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">We can call O Lord.
We can praise Your name,
Turn our heart to You,
Let You rule and reign.
Lord, a single heart that's true,
That's what we desire&amp;mdash;
A heart for You.</stanza>
