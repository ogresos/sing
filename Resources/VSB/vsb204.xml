  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Lovers of Christ in His ascension&amp;mdash;
Enjoy the riches of His life.
She becomes His private garden
With its fountain, fruit, and spice.
Christ is hers and she is Christ's dear love.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">She is as beautiful as Tirzah
As lovely as Jerusalem.
Through her living in Christ's ascension
Her dear heart is now His home.
She's become the sanctuary of God.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Who is this woman I am seeing?
Shining forth as the moon and sun.
She is absolutely heavenly,
From the old creation free;
Overcoming all to live within the veil.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">An army terrible with banners
Christ's lovers overcome to be.
Those attracted by His beauty,
Fully trusting in His power.
Her romance is now the dances of two camps.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">The Shulamite, His duplication,
His counterpart has now become.
She's the same in life and nature,
His expression to the full;
Consummated as the New Jerusalem.</stanza>
