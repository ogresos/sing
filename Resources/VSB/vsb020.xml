  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Praise the Lord, God sent His Son,
Hallelujah!
And salvation's work was done,
Glory to God!
God Himself became a man,
So that we might live in Him.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">That's why I call on Him,
I give my all to Him.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">For us He was crucified,
Hallelujah!
For the many, one Man died,
Glory to God!
One grain fell into the earth,
Many grains to bring to birth.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">He arose in victory,
Hallelujah!
From the grave, triumphantly,
Glory to God!
Now in resurrection He
As the Spirit lives in me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Call on Him from deep within,
Hallelujah!
Just by calling, He comes in,
Glory to God!
Once you call upon His name,
Nevermore you'll be the same.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">We all must call on Him,
We give our all to Him.</stanza>
