    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Is there someone who's a friend
That I can open to?
A someone who understands
All that I'm going through?
A someone when there's no one
I can always come to?
There is no someone like this One.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">There is a someone;
Someone you can open to.
There is a someone;
Someone who will take you through.
There is a someone when there is no one;
There is a someone, a wonderful One.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Is there someone who can care
Through all my hardest times?
A someone always there
Though it may rain or shine?
A someone I can lean on
When the stormy times come?
There is no someone like this One.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">There is a someone;
Someone in my hardest times.
There is a someone,
Always there through rain or shine.
There is a someone
When there is no one;
There is a someone, a special One.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Is there someone who will take
Take me just as I am?
A someone who'll not forsake
One I can trust to the end?
A someone who knows me
Yet he still wants me?
There is no someone like this One.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">There is a someone
Who will take you as you are.
There is a someone;
He will reach you near or far.
There is a someone;
He's the most lovely One.
Just take this someone, the loveliest One.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Is there someone who can reach
Down to the depths of my being?
A someone who can fix
All of my broken heart strings?
A someone who can love me
When there's no love in me?
There is no someone like this One.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">There is a someone
Who can touch your inmost being.
There is a someone;
He can make your heart to sing.
There is a someone,
Love is this precious One.
Just love this someone, the wonderful One.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Christ is this someone
Who can touch your inmost being.
Christ is this someone&amp;mdash;
He can make your heart to sing.
Christ is this someone.
Christ is this precious One.
Just love this someone, the wonderful One.</stanza>
