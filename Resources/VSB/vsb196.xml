    <stanza type="verse" number="1">From my heart comes a melody
Of the One who gave His life for me.
How can I turn away from Thee;
Lord, I have seen Thy changeless love for me.
Enjoyment so full!
Life's reality!
That's what You're to me:
Lord, You have won my heart!
Take my heart, take my whole life too;
Lord, I can't help giving myself to You.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">From the day that I first met You.
How could I help falling in love with You?
Emptiness turned life's pleasures blue;
No earthly love ever could see me through.
'Till I turned one day
Opened up my heart,
Let Your love flow in
And fill my deepest part.
Now I know, Lord, You're one with me;
And I can't help giving myself to Thee.
Lord, I can't help giving myself to Thee.</stanza>
