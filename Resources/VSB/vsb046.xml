    <stanza type="verse" number="1">So many times I was in weakness;
I realize that was my blindness.
I'm beginning to see
All that the Triune God is to me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Wasting my time looking at my poorness;
Now my heart's eyes can behold His greatness.
I'm enlightened to see
All of the Triune God is to me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">I believe, so I speak.
I am strong, I have power.
I believe, Oh Lord, Amen!
I am strong, I have power.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">All of God's power for His creation,
And all His might in incarnation,
Strength to be crucified
Which by the power of God was supplied.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">And His great power in resurrection,
He wrought in Christ, even ascension!
All things He has subdued
Under His feet, by power overruled.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Now in the church, in God's transmission,
All that He is, to His destination,
Here constantly receive.
He is dispensed to us who believe.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">The Triune God is now transmitting
Himself, this power, us energizing,
In us He is installed;
This dynamo within, the Triune God!</stanza>
