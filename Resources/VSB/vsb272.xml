    <stanza type="verse" number="">The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.
The Lord is the Spirit, the Spirit gives life.
But He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.
Oh, we have been joined to the Lord!
We are one spirit with Him.
The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.
The Lord is the Spirit, the Spirit gives life.</stanza>
