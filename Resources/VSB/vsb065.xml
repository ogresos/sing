    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Jesus, dear Jesus,
You're so glorious!
You're such a mystery.
I've been captured by Thee.
You're the greatest attraction,
All-extensive, all-inclusive Person.
You're the Infinite, beyond measure,
Yet my portion, my priceless treasure.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Jesus, dear Lord,
You're beyond man's word.
You're a God-man.
You're divine and human.
You're immortal with eternal might,
Yet became a mortal finite.
You're almighty, eternally the same,
Yet a man in time became.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Jesus, dear Lord,
You partook blood and flesh.
You're the Eternal Word,
God in a man manifest.
Lord, You died for humanity
To redeem man for eternity.
Lord, You died on a tree for me.
Lord, You loved me eternally.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Jesus, dear Christ,
Death can't hold You in the grave.
Now You're the Spirit.
You can enter man to save.
Satan plotted and killed You dead,
That destroyed him the devil instead.
Lord, You rose from the dead to be
The life-giving Spirit in me.</stanza>
