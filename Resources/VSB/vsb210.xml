  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">In the church of Jesus there is love for you,
Love most pure and tender, love most deep and true;
Why should you be lonely, why for friendship sigh,
When the church of Jesus has a full supply?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">In the church of Jesus there is life for you,
Warm as summer sunshine, sweet as morning dew;
Why should you be fearful, why take anxious thought,
Since the church of Jesus cares for those He bought?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">In the church of Jesus there is work for you;
Such as even angels might rejoice to do;
Why stand idly sighing for some life work grand,
While the church of Jesus seeks your reaping hand?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">In the church of Jesus there's a place for you;
Glorious, bright, and joyous, right and peaceful too;
Why then like a wand'rer, roam with weary pace,
If the church of Jesus holds for you a place.</stanza>
