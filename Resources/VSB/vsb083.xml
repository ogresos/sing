  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Come and rejoice with me!
For once my heart was poor,
And I have found a treasury
Of love, a boundless store.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Come and rejoice with me!
I, once so sick at heart,
Have met with One who knows my case,
And knows the healing art.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Come and rejoice with me!
For I was wearied sore,
And I have found a mighty arm
Which holds me evermore.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Come and rejoice with me!
My feet so wide did roam,
And One has brought me from afar,
To find in Him my home.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Come and rejoice with me!
For I have found a Friend
Who knows my heart's most secret depths,
Yet loves me without end.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">I knew not of His love;
And He had loved so long,
With love so faithful and so deep,
So tender and so strong.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">And now I know it all,
Have heard and known His voice,
And hear it still from day to day.
Can I enough rejoice?</stanza>
