  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">My goal is God Himself, not joy, nor peace,
Nor even blessing, but Himself, my God;
'Tis His to lead me there&amp;mdash;not mine, but His&amp;mdash;
At any cost, dear Lord, by any road.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">So faith bounds forward to its goal in God,
And love can trust her Lord to lead her there;
Upheld by Him, my soul is following hard
Till God hath full fulfilled my deepest prayer.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">No matter if the way be sometimes dark,
No matter though the cost be oft-times great,
He knoweth how I best shall reach the mark,
The way that leads to Him must needs be strait.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">One thing I know, I cannot say Him nay;
One thing I do, I press towards my Lord;
My God my glory here, from day to day,
And in the glory there my great Reward.</stanza>
