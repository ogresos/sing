  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Lord, how long, dear Bridegroom,
'Til You come, Lord, how soon?
Don't delay for that coming day, coming day.
Grant me, Lord, to be filled
With You, Lord, every day.
Dearest Lord, take me all the way.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Come, Lord Jesus,
Please come, dear Bridegroom;
Precious One, come soon, come soon.
Lord, consume me!
Oh Lord, don't let me stray,
Faithful to You all the way.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Lord, make home in all my heart
In my secret, deepest parts,
Hidden, Lord, and reserved for You, for You.
You would be preeminent
In all things and all events,
Possessed by Thee to this extent.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">In my prayer and deepest plea
In my spirit always be
Saturated and soaked with Thee, with Thee.
This would be my life daily.
Every hour expecting Thee,
This I pray, Lord, desperately!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">The universe, in it we see,
In the sweetest touch of Thee,
You're my choice and my destiny, destiny.
Lord, whate'er the price may be,
Lord, Amen, let it be!
Oh, my Love, please come back quickly!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">In Your love I am constrained.
What's within, I can't contain.
Lord, I can't any more restrain, restrain.
In Your love, I'll pour on Thee.
And the church, Your Bride to be,
This my choice voluntarily.</stanza>
