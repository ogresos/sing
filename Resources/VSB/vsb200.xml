    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Lord, in these days I want to set my heart,
Ever and only, always on You,
That I would not defiled be,
Keeping my heart so single and pure for Thee.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Lord, write Your law, inscribe on our hearts,
That this law of life, would of us be part,
We are so hopeless, yet we hope in Him,
Preparing a way for Christ to come in.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Lord as the fountain You'd want us to drink,
Always supplying, it's my only link,
Staying connected to this precious flow,
Planting my roots here that they would grow.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">You are the Potter, we are the clay,
Form now the church, Your expression today,
In Christ there's nothing that we may lack,
As now Your Body, we'd bring You back.</stanza>
