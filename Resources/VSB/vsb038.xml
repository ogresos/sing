  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">There is a great mystery,
A wonderful story;
For ages 'twas hidden,
Now shown in His wisdom;
'Tis a divine romance
Of God and man in time;
Beyond understanding,
Yet seen in God's speaking.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">God fell in love with man;
For only God's love can
Make man just the same as He
In life and in nature.
We are His expression,
His bride, His enlargement;
Forever, together,
As living, insep'rable as one couple
Eternally.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Though He was rejected
By men who were blinded;
His love is constraining,
His heart still unchanging;
Thus in incarnation
Came He as salvation;
His name is called Jesus,
And He came to seek us.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Though born as a sinner,
His blood has redeemed me.
He suffered on Calv'ry,
Then raised up in glory,
To regenerate me.
Now joined in one spirit
I love to enjoy Him,
For I've been forgiven!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">His love is so tender,
To Him I'll surrender;
His name is so precious,
I gladly call, "Jesus!"
His Person's so charming,
My heart ever winning;
I'll hold back no longer,
I'll love Him forever.</stanza>
