    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Lord, Your return...
How long must it be, dear Lord?
The ages have come,
The centuries have gone,
The years have passed us by.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Lovely One, come soon.
Precious Lord, return!
Lord, do not delay.
We'll redeem everyday
For Your coming soon.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">A generation...
Lord, of them that seek Your face;
A remnant for You
Whose hearts are so true.
They're those who just love You.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">King of glory come in!
Saints, open wide to Him.
O, lift up Your gate,
It's not too late.
Let the King come in.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">A generation...
With a goal to bring You back.
Their treasure is You,
You're their future too.
They care for only You.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">This goal is deep within,
A fire that's burning in them.
They're consumed by this zeal,
This only is real,
Lord, to bring You back.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">A generation...
Lord, by You they are possessed.
You have captured their heart,
The world has no part,
Their joy is only You.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">They're virgins pure and wise.
Just You are in their eyes.
Their hearts make full room
For You, dear Bridegroom,
For Your coming soon.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Oh, generation...
The Spirit and Bride say come &amp;mdash;
The Spirit's calling you.
The Bride is calling too!
Take heed to this mingled cry!</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Come, oh seekers, come
To our Groom, most pleasant Person.
God's eternal plan
Is to mingle with man.
This His satisfaction.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Oh come, Lord Jesus...
For this cause, Lord, strengthen us.
Keep us faithful to stand
All the way to the end.
Uphold us in Your hands.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Come, Lord Jesus, come
For Your Bride, New Jerusalem.
Till we meet face to face,
Fill us daily with grace.
For that day make haste.</stanza>
