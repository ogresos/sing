  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Lord Jesus, I love You,
No other one for me will do.
I love You, just love You.
Without You, Lord, I am through.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">No other one for me will do.
My heart is drawn, I just love You.
I just love You, dear Lord.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">As mercy, You reached me.
You laid aside Your glory.
You're God, Lord, the Almighty,
Yes You became a slave for me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">What kind of love You have for man,
Beyond our power to comprehend!
I love You, Lord Jesus.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">I'm evil and fallen.
My nature, Lord, is just sin.
You're righteous and holy.
All that You are was condemning me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">What made You Lord to die for me?
You joined man's race and took my place,
Redeeming us Jesus.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">You died, Lord, on Calvary.
Your blood is flowing now for me.
Your blood, Lord, is precious.
O, what a price You paid for us!</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">No tongue or pen can ever tell:
Your mercy reached me down in hell.
You reached me, Lord Jesus.</stanza>
