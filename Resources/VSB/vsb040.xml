    <stanza type="verse" number="1">God made me to be a man.
I'm so glad I'm in His plan.
He chose me before the world began&amp;mdash;
I'm so happy that I'm a man.
Look at the many items in the
Heaven and earth we see;
Billions of things that He has made;
It's all for you and me.
I am a vessel made by God,
Predestined as His son to be;
He chose me way back
In eternity.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Satan came to corrupt man,
And spoil God's wonderful plan.
But our God took on the flesh of man
To die for weak, sinful man.
I never thought the
Mighty God became a man like me,
To put on flesh and blood
And lay aside His glory.
He took up all our sins
Upon His body to a tree
To redeem us from our sins,
We're now set free!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Christ came in my deepest part&amp;mdash;
Into my spirit and heart.
He came in to never leave apart,
Now we have a fresh, new start.
Christ came into my spirit
Very, very deep within.
Simply by calling on His name
I have experienced Him.
Christ is my life and person now
In resurrection.
Oh, just call on Him,
He'll fill you to the brim!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Fill, fill, fill! I'm full of Him.
Joy, joy, joy! Overflowing.
Love, love, love! Coming from Him within.
Oh, I have touched the King!</stanza>
