  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">God wants someone to love Him,
Not just someone to serve Him;
He wants someone to love Him
    As His bride.
God wants someone to match Him,
Not just to imitate Him;
He wants a counterpart,
    One from His side.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">For this He came down to us,
He came to court, to woo us,
Away from everything, and unto Him.
Now we're espoused unto Him,
Pledged and betrothed unto Him;
Yes, we are bound unto Him by His love.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">God wants someone to love Him,
Not just someone to fear Him;
He wants a sweetheart who will
    Be His bride.
God wants someone to know Him,
Not just to know about Him,
He wants someone who'll look Him
    In the eye.</stanza>
