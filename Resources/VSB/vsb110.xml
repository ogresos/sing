  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Lord, grant me today's supply of grace;
May Your divine life grow apace;
Little by little, day by day, to grow
More and more, into You.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Day by day, bit by bit, life will grow as is fit,
Increasing gradually until,
However imperceptibly,
Your life matures within me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">I would be desperately, constantly, patiently,
Drawing each breath of life from You, Lord;
Knowing that every day while I breathe,
Your life will permeate me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Every day, may I rest, knowing that each bequest,
Matches my daily need exactly;
Jesus Christ intercedes for me,
A member of His body.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Lord, grant me a heavenly, corporate view;
That all of my growth and prayers to You,
Little by little, day by day,
Would cause building up into You.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">We would be corporately, growing up steadily
Till we reach the stature of Your fullness;
Transforming and conforming us, Your
Manifested people.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Lord, grant me today's supply of grace;
May Your divine life grow apace;
Little by little, day by day, to grow
More and more, into You.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Lord, grant me a heavenly, corporate view;
That all of my growth and prayers to You,
Little by little, day by day,
Would cause building up into the New Jerusalem.</stanza>
