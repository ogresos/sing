  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Lord, take my life
I give it, Lord, to You.
You have opened my eyes, Lord,
And turned me to You.
You are my Creator, O Lord,
How I love You.
You are also my Savior
And everything that's true.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Lord, so often I'm like Thomas
Who would not receive:
"Unless I see Your face, Lord, I would not believe..."
But then You would appear...
"My Lord and my God"
Saying, Blessed are they who see not, yet believe.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">I have someone deep within me
Welling up in me each day.
Even though I have not seen Him in such an outward way&amp;mdash;
"Whom having not seen, I love,
I love, oh so much.
And by having His life, yes, I believe."
(Chorus)</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Day by day I look forward to
That time I spend with You.
Just as Mary poured her love out,
O Lord, I would too.
Grant me, Lord, a heart
that's single and true.
And a daily life that's living just by You.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">So when daily I see trials
And tribulations sore,
May I put my trust in You, Lord,
"For Christ has gone before"
And open to Your living Word,
Receiving faith&amp;mdash;
Reach me, Lord, with Your mercy and Your grace.
(Chorus)</stanza>
