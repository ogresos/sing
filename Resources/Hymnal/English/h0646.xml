    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Oh, trust thyself to Jesus
  When conscious of thy sin,
Its heavy weight upon thee,
  Its mighty pow'r within:
Then is the hour for pleading
  His finished work for thee:
Then is the time for singing,
  His blood was shed for me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Oh, trust thyself to Jesus
  When tempted to transgress,
By word or look of anger,
  Or thought of bitterness:
Then is the hour for claiming
  Thy Lord to fight for thee:
Then is the time for singing,
  He doth deliver me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Oh, trust thyself to Jesus
  When daily cares perplex,
And trifles seem so mighty
  Thy inner soul to vex:
Then is the hour for grasping
  His hand who walked the sea:
Then is the time for singing
  He makes it calm for me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Oh, trust thyself to Jesus
  When thou art wearied sore,
When head or hand refuses
  To think or labor more:
Then is the hour for leaning
  Upon the Master's breast:
Then is the time for singing,
  My Savior gives me rest.</stanza>
