    <stanza type="verse" number="1">All that we were&amp;mdash;our sin, our guilt,
  Our death&amp;mdash;was all our own:
All that we are we owe to Thee,
  Thou God of grace alone.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Thy mercy found us in our sins,
  And gave us to believe;
Then, in believing, peace we found,
  And in Thy Christ we live.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">All that we are, as saints on earth,
  All that we hope to be,
When Jesus comes and glory dawns,
  We owe it all to Thee.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">O God, how rich, how vast Thy love,
  Whoe'er can Thee repay?
Thy love is past man's finding out,
  Thy grace no man can say.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">But Lord, to me I pray Thee grant,
  More clearly may I see,
That I may e'er more fully know
  How much I owe to Thee.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">But if man's heart should e'er suppose
  He could repay Thy love,
It only means he nothing knows
  Of love, all loves above.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">So may we never bargains make
  With that dear love of Thine:
The love that made Thine heart once break,
  Whoe'er that love could win?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">Then nevermore suggest return,
  His love is far too high;
But let our hearts with rapture burn
  That He for us should die.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="9">O Father God, we owe Thee all!
  All that we are and have!
With grateful thanks before Thee fall,
  'Tis all that we can give.</stanza>
