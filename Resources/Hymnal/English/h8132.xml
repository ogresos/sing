    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Longer stretched than East from West,
Broader than the vast expanse,
Higher than the heavenlies,
Deeper than the deepest seas,
Oh, Christ's great love!</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Awesome! Vast! Tremendous!
Christ's love's so great!
Depth and height and breadth and length,
Boundless, rich, to me conveyed
From age to age!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Length &amp;mdash; that caused my Lord to die,
Breadth &amp;mdash; salvation to apply,
Height &amp;mdash; He raised me to the skies,
Depth &amp;mdash; He comes to be my life,
Oh, Christ's great love!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Length &amp;mdash; that I forgiveness gain,
Breadth &amp;mdash; His grace I now obtain,
Height &amp;mdash; I share His heav'nly throne,
Depth &amp;mdash; in me He makes His home,
Oh, Christ's great love!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Length and breadth immeas'urable,
Height and depth unspeakable,
Yet 'tis by these words described:
"Breadth" and "Length" and "Depth" and "Height"&amp;mdash;
Oh, Christ's great love!</stanza>
