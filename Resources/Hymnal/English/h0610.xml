	<stanza type="verse" number="1">God's Spirit His transmission is,
In Him God enters into us;
It is in Him that God in Christ
May be experienced by us.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">God as the Father is the source,
And God the Son doth Him express;
God as the Spirit enters us,
That God as all we may possess.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">The Father, who is veiled in light,
The Son to man hath fully shown;
The Spirit then transmitteth Him
That He may inwardly be known.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">The Son within the Father is,
And now the Spirit is the Son.
The Spirit, Son, and Father God
Are now in us and with us one.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">God as the Father in the Son
Has been embodied and expressed,
And God the Spirit is the Son's
Reality to be possessed.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">May God the Father's love to us
In God the Son as grace be known,
Thru God the Spirit's fellowship,
That God our portion we may own.</stanza>
