    <stanza type="verse" number="1">There is life for a look at the Crucified One,
  There is life at this moment for thee;
Then look, sinner, look unto Him and be saved,
  Unto Him who was nailed to the tree.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Look! look! look and live!
There is life for a look at the Crucified One,
  There is life at this moment for thee.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Oh, why was He there as the Bearer of sin,
  If on Jesus thy guilt was not laid?
Oh, why from His side flowed the sin-cleansing blood,
  If His dying thy debt has not paid?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">It is not thy tears of repentance or prayers,
  But the blood, that redeemeth the soul;
On Him, then, who shed it, thou mayest at once
  Thy weight of iniquities roll.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Then doubt not thy welcome, since God has declared
  There remaineth no more to be done;
That once in the end of the world He appeared,
  And completed the work He begun.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Then take with rejoicing from Jesus at once
  The life everlasting He gives;
And know with assurance, thou never canst die
  Since Jesus, thy Righteousness, lives.</stanza>
