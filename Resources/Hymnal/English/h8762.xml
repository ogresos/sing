  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Lord, I've been waiting for Your coming,
Waiting so long.
Lord, now my restless wait seems endless,
Continually prolonged.
I deeply long to see Your visage,
Your voice to hear.
I hope for fellowship much closer,
Than what today is here.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Must I still wait several more years;
Wander yet some more?
Rememb'ring You still shed yet more tears?
Before You come back, Lord?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">How can the widow put off mourning,
Her love not miss?
Not seeing him can she stop weeping
And no more reminisce?
How can the bride before her wedding
Not lovesick be?
Will not that joyful day's postponing
Make her sigh constantly?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Age after age the church has waited&amp;mdash;
Thousands of years;
Age after age endures in waiting,
But You are not yet here.
I've also waited many long years
Since I was young.
Friends one by one have aged and died, Lord,
But You have not yet come.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Through years of trials, Lord, I've waited&amp;mdash;
I'm tired now.
Slowly it's easier to murmer,
And to forget my vow.
So, Lord, I pray, delay no longer.
Please come soon, Lord!
Already I've endured till today
Can I still suffer more?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Lord, note my prolonged wait; it's so hard
To continue.
If you cannot come back in time then
Take me, Lord, unto You.
This long, long time You hide Your glory
Remain above;
Already some would sneer and mock me
Saying You will not come.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">For all my heart's deep pain and suff'ring,
No comfort now.
There's no one that could help me now, Lord,
For You're not here with me.
Until You come, lead me to glory,
Nothing is sweet.
All this along the way I've suffered
I'll forget when we meet.</stanza>
