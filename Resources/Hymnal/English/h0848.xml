  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">What a blessing, what a priv'lege!
  Called of God a royal priest,
That this glorious, holy office
  I should bear, though last and least.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">All the building of the Body
  On the priesthood doth depend;
Ever praying in the spirit
    I this office would attend.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">If I keep this royal calling
  Under Thine authority,
Priestly duty thus fulfilling,
  Then the church will builded be.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Now the church is but the priesthood;
  Thus the priesthood formed we need;
When the priests are knit together,
  Then the church is built indeed.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Through the church's degradation,
  Saints this office desolate;
Through the weakness of their spirits
  Preaching doth predominate.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Most are leaning on the message
  And the preaching emphasize,
Yet neglect the priestly praying
  And their spirits' exercise.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Deal with me and make me balanced,
  As in preaching, so in prayer;
Leading others oft in praying,
  As Thy Word I too declare.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Only serving by our praying
  Will our spirits mingled be;
Stressing prayer as much as preaching&amp;mdash;
  Thus the church is built for Thee.</stanza>
