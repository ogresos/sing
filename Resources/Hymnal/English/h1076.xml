    <stanza type="verse" number="1">O teach me what it meaneth:
  That Cross uplifted high,
With One, the Man of Sorrows,
  Condemned to bleed and die.
O teach me what it cost Thee
  To make a sinner whole;
And teach me, Savior, teach me
  The value of a soul.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">O teach me what it meaneth:
  That sacred crimson tide,
The blood and water flowing
  From Thine own wounded side.
Teach me that if none other
  *Had sinned, but I alone,
Yet still, Thy blood, O Jesus,
  Thine only, must atone.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">O teach me what it meaneth,
  Thy love beyond compare,
The love that reacheth deeper
  Than depths of self-despair!
Yea, teach me, till there gloweth
  In this cold heart of mine
Some feeble, pale reflection
  Of that pure love of Thine.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">O teach me what it meaneth,
  For I am full of sin;
And grace alone can reach me,
  And love alone can win.
O teach me, for I need Thee,
  I have no hope beside,
The chief of all the sinners
  For whom the Savior died.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">O teach me what it meaneth:
  The rest which Thou dost give
To all the heavy-laden
  Who look to Thee and live.
Because I am a rebel
  Thy pardon I receive:
Because Thou dost command me,
  I can, I do believe.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">O infinite Redeemer,
  I bring no other plea;
Because Thou dost invite me
  I cast myself on Thee.
Because Thou dost accept me
  I love and I adore;
Because Thy love constraineth,
  I'll praise Thee evermore.</stanza>
    <stanza type="note" number="">* The Compilers prefer that the following three lines be used in place of the last three lines in verse 2: Had sinned but only I, / Yet still, O blessed Savior, / Thou on the cross must die.</stanza>
