    <stanza type="verse" number="1">The Church's one foundation
  Is Jesus Christ her Lord;
She is His new creation
  By water and the Word:
From heav'n He came and sought her
  To be His holy Bride;
With His own blood He bought her,
  And for her life He died.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Elect from every nation,
  Yet one o'er all the earth,
Her charter of salvation,
  One Lord, one faith, one birth;
One holy Name she blesses,
  Partakes one holy food,
And to one hope she presses,
  With every grace endued.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">'Mid toil and tribulation,
  And tumult of her war,
She waits the consummation
  Of peace for evermore;
Till, with the vision glorious,
  Her longing eyes are blest,
And the great Church victorious
  Shall be the Church at rest.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Yet she on earth hath union
  With God the Three in One,
And mystic sweet communion
  With those whose rest is won:
O happy ones and holy!
  Lord, give us grace that we,
Like them, the meek and lowly,
  In love may dwell with Thee.</stanza>
