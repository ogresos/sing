    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Simply trusting every day;
Trusting through a stormy way;
Even when my faith is small,
Trusting Jesus, that is all.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Trusting as the moments fly,
Trusting as the days go by,
Trusting Him, whate'er befall,
  Trusting Jesus, that is all.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Brightly doth His Spirit shine
Into this poor heart of mine;
While He leads I cannot fall,
Trusting Jesus, that is all.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Singing if my way be clear,
Praying if the path be drear;
If in danger, for Him call,
Trusting Jesus, that is all.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Trusting Him while life shall last,
Trusting Him till earth is past,
Till His gracious advent call,
Trusting Jesus, that is all.</stanza>
