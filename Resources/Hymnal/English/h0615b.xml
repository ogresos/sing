    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Begin the day with God!
  He is thy Sun and Day!
His is the radiance of thy dawn;
  To Him address thy lay.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Sing a new song at morn!
  Join the glad woods and hills;
Join the fresh winds and seas and plains,
  Join the bright flowers and rills.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Sing thy first song to God!
  Not to thy fellow men;
Not to the creatures of His hand,
  But to the glorious One.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Take thy first walk with God!
  Let Him go forth with thee;
By stream, or sea, or mountain path,
  Seek still His company.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Thy first transaction be
  With God Himself above;
So shall thy business prosper well
  And all the day be love.</stanza>
