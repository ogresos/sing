	<stanza type="verse" number="1">Man is a being of three parts,
The body, soul, and spirit too,
Th' eternal purpose to fulfill
With God's inheritance in view.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">The body is the outward part
That man a world-sense may possess;
Thus he may touch the outward things
And bodily himself express.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">The soul within&amp;mdash;the inward part&amp;mdash;
Is but the very self of man;
The sense of self it gives to him
To touch the psychic world of man.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">The spirit is the inmost part
With which the Lord he may receive;
The sense of God it gives to man
That he the spirit-world perceive.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">Within the soul of man there are
The mind, emotion, and the will;
These are the functions for the man
His human nature to fulfill.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">Within the spirit of the man
Are found the conscience, fellowship,
And intuition, which thereby
The man to worship God equip.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">The man must exercise his soul
To choose that God he may possess,
And by his spirit God partake,
And thru his body God express.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="8">Man's spirit has to be reborn
With life divine to him conveyed;
His soul must be transformed by God,
His body like Christ's body made.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="9">'Tis by these steps of work divine
In each of man's three separate parts
That man is mingled with the Lord
And His expression full imparts.</stanza>
