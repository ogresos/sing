  <lyrics>
	<stanza type="verse" number="1">I come before Thy throne of grace
With hungry heart on Thee to feed,
Thy grace and mercy to receive
To help me in this hour of need.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">Here I behold Thy radiant face,
Its light upon my heart doth shine
With healing rays consuming all
The weaknesses and faults of mine.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">'Tis here Thy light illuminates
My true condition unto me;
'Tis here Thy blood's effectiveness
To cleanse from sin I gladly see.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">Thy Spirit too anoints me here
And makes Thy very substance mine;
Thy very self I thus enjoy
And know Thy very heart's design.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">Thy Word I read before Thee here
E'en as the priests the lamp did light;
Thy Spirit is as oil to me
To light Thy Word and give me sight.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">E'en as the priests the incense burned,
In prayer to Thee I persevere;
As incense Thou the Spirit art
Mixed with the prayer I offer here.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">Thy Word is light, Thy Word is food;
Which doth enlighten and supply;
I long to read and feed much more,
For light and food to satisfy.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="8">Thou art the living water too
Which full revival doth bestow;
I wish to pray and drink e'en more
That through me living rivers flow.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="9">Thou art the incense unto God,
In Thee acceptance is complete;
I want to pray yet more and more,
To offer up this fragrance sweet.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="10">By reading I'm enlightened, filled,
By prayer my thirst is quenched indeed;
Thus Thou to me may be supplied,
And Thou through me may meet the need.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="11">I long to have such fellowship
To read and pray and blend with Thee;
I long that Thou wouldst saturate
Till Thou may overflow from me.</stanza>
