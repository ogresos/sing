    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Jesus, where'er Thy people meet,
  There they behold Thy mercy-seat;
Where'er they seek Thee, Thou art found,
  With grace and mercy to abound.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">For Thou, within no walls confined,
  Inhabitest the humble mind;
Such ever bring Thee where they come,
  And going, take Thee to their home.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Dear Shepherd of Thy chosen few,
  Thy former mercies here renew;
Here, to our waiting hearts, proclaim
  The sweetness of Thy saving Name.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Here may we prove the power of prayer
  To strengthen faith and sweeten care;
To teach our faint desires to rise,
  And bring Thy light before our eyes.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Lord, we are few, but Thou art near;
  Nor short Thine arm, nor deaf Thine ear;
Oh, rend the heavens, come quickly down,
  And make our waiting hearts Thine own.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Command Thy blessing in this hour;
  And as the Spirit full of pow'r
With life and vision fill this place,
  That all Thy purpose we may trace.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">O Thou, our Head, our Life, our Guide,
  May nought in life or death divide
The saints in Thy communion blessed,
  That all Thy fulness be expressed.</stanza>
