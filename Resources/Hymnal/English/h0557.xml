    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Jesus Himself drew near,
  And joined them as they walked,
And soon their hearts began to burn,
  As of Himself He talked:
    Draw near, O Lord.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Jesus Himself drew near,
  They were no longer sad;
When He was walking at their side,
  How could they but be glad?
    Draw near, O Lord.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Jesus Himself drew near,
  And all their doubts were solved;
He showed them why Christ came to die,
  And what that death involved:
    Draw near, O Lord.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Jesus Himself drew near,
  And at the journey's end
They could not let Him leave them thus,
  The Stranger was their Friend:
    Draw near, O Lord.</stanza>
