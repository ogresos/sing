  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Arise, my soul, arise!
  Shake off thy guilty fears;
  The bleeding Sacrifice
  In my behalf appears.
Before the throne my Surety stands;
My name is written on His hands.
My name is written on His hands.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">He ever lives above
  For me to intercede,
  His all-redeeming love,
  His precious blood to plead.
His blood was shed for all our race,
And sprinkles now the throne of grace.
And sprinkles now the throne of grace.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Five bleeding wounds He bears,
  Received on Calvary;
  They pour effectual prayers;
  They strongly speak for me.
Forgive him, O forgive, they cry,
Nor let that ransomed sinner die!
Nor let that ransomed sinner die!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">The Father hears Him pray,
  His dear anointed One;
  He cannot turn away
  The presence of His Son.
His Spirit answers to the blood,
And tells me I am born of God.
And tells me I am born of God.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">To God I'm reconciled,
  His pardoning voice I hear;
  He owns me for His child,
  I can no longer fear.
With confidence I now draw nigh,
And Father, Abba, Father, cry.
And Father, Abba, Father, cry.</stanza>
