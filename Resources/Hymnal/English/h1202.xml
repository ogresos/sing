    <stanza type="verse" number="1">God in His justifying has a plan,
A deeper purpose for a corporate man.
When we were called, this mighty Lord of all
Appeared to us to save us from the fall.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">We walked as strangers unaware of Him,
But in His glory God shined deep within,
Infusing His own element in us;
This precious essence was our Lord Jesus.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">What glory! How attractive was this light!
How we appreciated such a sight!
Our first reaction was belief in Him&amp;mdash;
This precious God has placed Himself within.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Our first reflection of this element
Reflected Jesus back to God, Who sent
His own response to count as righteousness
Our faith in Him Who was infused in us.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">But we would hold to this reality,
Our Jesus Christ in us our all to be,
Enjoying all He is abundantly,
Content to have this One eternally.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Thus God could never be so satisfied;
Knowing that we cared only to abide
In our experiences of His Son,
Not caring for His goal to make us one.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Still He would seek those faithful saints who'd hear
His call to give up everything so dear,
To offer up their individual Christ;
To come together for the Body life.</stanza>
