    <stanza type="verse" number="1">The Bible is the Word of God,
  Its message is but one&amp;mdash;
Christ and the church, His holy Bride,
  The two becoming one.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Oh, what a miracle that we could be His Bride!
  Oh, what a miracle! All else we lay aside
That we may now prepare to meet Him in the air
    And ever in our Bridegroom's love abide.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">The Father is the mighty God,
  His purpose is but one&amp;mdash;
To find a Bride for Christ the Lord
  And give her to His Son.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">The Son is Jesus Christ the Lord,
  His heart desire's but one&amp;mdash;
To have a loving counterpart,
  A Bride He's wooed and won.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">The Spirit is but Christ Himself,
  He is the Lord applied
To generate the men of earth,
  Transform them as His Bride.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">The living Word is Jesus too,
  God-breathed as life to us,
That we be wholly sanctified,
  A Bride all-glorious.</stanza>
