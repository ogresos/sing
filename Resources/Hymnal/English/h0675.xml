  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">God moves in a mysterious way
  His wonders to perform:
He plants His footsteps in the sea,
  And rides upon the storm.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Deep in unfathomable mines
  Of never-failing skill,
He treasures up His bright designs,
  And works His sovereign will.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take;
  The clouds ye so much dread
Are big with mercy, and shall break
  In blessings on your head.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,
  But trust Him for His grace;
Behind a frowning providence
  He hides a smiling face.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">His purposes will ripen fast,
  Unfolding every hour:
The bud may have a bitter taste,
  But sweet will be the flower.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Blind unbelief is sure to err,
  And scan His work in vain;
God is His own Interpreter,
  And He will make it plain.</stanza>
