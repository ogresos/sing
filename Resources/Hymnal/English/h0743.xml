  <lyrics>
	<stanza type="verse" number="1">God created us His vessels
  His expression to achieve;
Thus He made a heart to love Him
  And a spirit to receive.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">With our heart we have to love Him,
  With our spirit Him possess
As our life, of Him partaking,
  That Himself we may express.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">Satan has our heart corrupted,
  To our spirit death did give,
That the Lord we should not contact
  But by self attempt to live.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">Thus the Lord in His salvation
  Heart and spirit has renewed
To recover our receiving
  And our loving aptitude.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">It is by our heart's renewal
  We may God in love pursue,
And in newness of the spirit
  We may contact God anew.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">Ever true and pure and single
  To the Lord our heart must be,
Poor in spirit, ever seeking
  God to contact constantly.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">Keep our heart, Lord, in love's freshness,
  And our spirit strengthen more,
That in newness of the spirit
  We may touch Thee o'er and o'er.</stanza>
