    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Forgiveness when no blood was shed,
What then of righteousness?
Reproof when blood already flowed,
Would likewise be unjust.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">O God, no more can You condemn;
My Lord was sacrificed;
I'm fully free, as far from sin
As East is far from West.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">All that Your righteousness demands
My Lord has fully paid;
Now You can only pardon grant;
No judgment can be made.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">At first, â€˜twas love bade Him redeem,
Your righteousness appease,
But now by righteousness He must
Sin's prisoners release.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Astounding! Love and righteousness
Both at the cross I see;
So moved by what they two have wrought,
I'll sing unceasingly.</stanza>
