	<stanza type="verse" number="1">Riches of Christ we should enjoy
And then His fulness we will be;
Partaking of His very self,
His testimony men will see.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">Riches of Christ are what He is
To us who are His members true;
His fulness is what we become
As body doth to man accrue.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">Riches of Christ are typified
By Canaan's produce rich and sweet,
With which the temple great was built,
The Church's greatest type replete.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">As Eve to Adam fulness was,
So is the Church to Christ her Head;
As Eve from Adam's being came,
The Church by Christ's own life is bred.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">Christ's riches are Himself within,
His fulness is the Church without,
As His expression, full of Him;
The Church with Christ is built throughout.</stanza>
