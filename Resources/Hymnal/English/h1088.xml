    <stanza type="verse" number="1">God was born a human being
  As the Babe of Bethlehem,
Passed He then through human living,
  Perfect blend of God with men.
God, according to His plan,
  Lived a mingled life with man.
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
  Hallelujah, Amen!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Then with God this man was blended
  On the altar as He died;
God and man and all creation
  On the cross were crucified.
Man and all of God's creation,
  Sunk in total termination.
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
  Hallelujah, Amen!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Everything we are was ended,
  Terminated on the cross,
Only man in God ascended,
  Man in Adam suffered loss.
Hallelujah, we're elated,
  Our old man was terminated.
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
  Hallelujah, Amen!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Like the grain of wheat that's buried
  In the earth to be increased,
God's own life the death must suffer,
  Thus in man to be released.
Oh, the Lord of all be praised;
  God released in man is raised!
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
  Hallelujah, Amen!</stanza>
