    <stanza type="verse" number="1">How vast, immense, and measureless
The love of Christ to me!
How else could such a wretch as I
Be blessed so graciously?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">To bring me back unto Himself,
My Lord His all did spend;
So I would gladly bear the cross
And follow to the end.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">My all I have forsaken now,
This blessed Christ to gain;
Now life or death is no concern&amp;mdash;
What else can me restrain?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">My dear ones, wealth ambition, fame&amp;mdash;
What can they offer me?
My gracious Lord for me was poor;
For Him I poor would be.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">My precious Savior now I love,
Him only would I please.
For Him all gain a loss becomes,
And comfort holds no ease.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Thou art my comfort, gracious Lord!
I've none in heav'n but Thee.
And who but Thee is there on earth
With whom I love to be?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Though loneliness and trials come,
My griefs I'd rise above.
This only would I ask Thee, Lord:
Surround me with Thy love!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">O gracious Lord, I now beseech,
Guide me through every stage;
Stand by and strengthen me to go
Through this dark, evil age.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="9">The world, the flesh, and Satan too,
Do tempt my soul apace;
Without Thy love and strength'ning power
I may Thy name disgrace.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="10">The time, dear Lord, is running short;
From earth my soul set free.
When Thou dost come, I'll sing with joy,
Hallelujah to Thee!</stanza>
