  <lyrics>
	<stanza type="verse" number="1">Christ is the mystery of God;
God is invisible, unshown,
His image man hath never seen,
But Christ the Son hath made Him known.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">Christ is the very Word of God,
He is God's explanation true;
God's full embodiment is He
And God's own image brings to view.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">Image of God invisible,
Effulgence of God's glory fair;
God's fulness ever dwells in Him,
God's testimony He doth bear.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">The Church the myst'ry is of Christ,
For He is now to man unshown;
No man on earth may see Him now,
But thru the Church He is made known.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">The Church is Christ's expression full,
In her Christ dwelleth bodily;
She is His duplication true,
And man in her Himself may see.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">The Church the image has of Christ,
She is His increase and His spread;
Christ's very self is found in her
The Body, she, to Christ the Head.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">Thus, in the Son the Father is,
And now the Spirit is the Son;
The Spirit of the triune God
Is in the Church and with her one.</stanza>
