    <stanza type="verse" number="1">All the saints of Christ are
  Members every one;
All coordinating
  Into oneness come.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Though the gifts are many,
  Yet the Spirit one;
Many too the functions,
  But one Lord, the Son.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Each, the others needing,
  Must impartial be;
Each his place possesses
  And utility.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">By our grace are measured
  Gifts both large and small;
Each with sober judgment
  Takes his place with all.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Each fulfills his duty,
  Shows his usefulness,
Fervent in the spirit,
  Girt with faithfulness.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Knitting and supplying,
  Bearing much in grace;
Not a trace of discord,
  Christ is giv'n His place.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">We, the Church, His Body,
  He, the Head, the Son;
By the Spirit's flowing,
  We are joined in one.</stanza>
