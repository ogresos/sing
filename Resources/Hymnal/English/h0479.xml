    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Oh, what a wonderful place
  Jesus has given to me!
Saved by His glorious grace,
  I may be even as He.
When with my Lord I appear,
  Like Him I know I shall be;
But while I walk with Him here,
  I may be even as He.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Even as He, even as He,
Wonderful words that even we,
Saved by His marvelous grace may be
  One with the Savior, even as He.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">One in His death on the tree,
  One as He rose from the dead;
I from the curse am as free
  E'en as my glorious head.
One on the throne by His side,
  One in His sonship divine;
One as the Bridegroom and bride,
  One as the branch and the vine.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">One in His merits I stand,
  One as I pray in His name;
All that His worth can command,
  I can with confidence claim.
One in His faith and His love,
  One in His life I may be.
Sealed by the heavenly Dove,
  I may be holy as He.</stanza>
