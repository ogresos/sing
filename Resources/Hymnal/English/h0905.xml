    <stanza type="verse" number="1">O Master, let me walk with Thee
  In lowly paths of service free;
Tell me Thy secret, help me bear
  The strain of toil, the fret of care.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Help me the slow of heart to move
  By some clear, winning word of love;
Teach me the wayward feet to stay,
  And guide them in the Godward way.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Teach me Thy patience; still with Thee
  In closer, dearer company,
In work that keeps faith sweet and strong,
  In trust that triumphs over wrong.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">In hope that sends a shining ray
  Far down the future's broad'ning way,
In peace that only Thou canst give,
  With Thee, O Master, let me live.</stanza>
