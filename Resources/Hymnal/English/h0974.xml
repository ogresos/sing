  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">He looked for a city and lived in a tent,
A pilgrim to glory right onward he went;
God's promise his solace, so royal his birth,
No wonder he sought not the glories of earth.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">City! O city fair!
  God's dwelling with man to eternity is there.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">He looked for a city, his God should prepare;
No mansion on earth, could he covet or share,
For had not God told him, that royal abode
Awaited His pilgrims on ending the road.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">He looked for a city; if sometimes he sighed
To be trudging the road, all earth's glory denied,
The thought of that city changed sighing to song,
For the road might be rough, but it could not be long.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">He looked for a city, his goal, Lord, we share
And know that bright city, which Thou dost prepare
Is ever our portion, since willing to be
Just pilgrims with Jesus, our roof a tent tree.</stanza>
