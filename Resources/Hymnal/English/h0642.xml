    <stanza type="verse" number="1">"Within the Veil": be this, belov'd, thy portion,
  Within the secret of thy Lord to dwell;
Beholding Him, until thy face His glory,
  Thy life His love, thy lips His praise shall tell.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">"Within the Veil," for only as thou gazest
  Upon the matchless beauty of His face,
Canst thou become a living revelation
  Of His great heart of love, His untold grace.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">"Within the Veil," His fragrance poured upon thee,
  Without the Veil, that fragrance shed abroad;
"Within the Veil," His hand shall tune the music
  Which sounds on earth the praises of Thy Lord.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">"Within the Veil," thy spirit deeply anchored,
  Thou walkest calm above a world of strife;
"Within the Veil," thy soul with Him united,
  Shall live on earth His resurrection life.</stanza>
