  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Why grasp riches, harbor worry?
  God's own servant will be fed;
If our God controls your outlays
  You will not to drought be led.
Daily new demands may threaten,
  Daily He has fresh supply;
You are His endeared creation&amp;mdash;
  Trust His path, not asking why.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Show your love and give your substance;
  Still some measure will remain.
For your love and giving action,
  God will bless and bless again.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Trust! More time you needn't borrow;
  Though not fast, it is not slow.
Trust! The bottle will not empty;
  From His means He will bestow.
Though the lily may be naked,
  Though the bird is short of aid,
Yet the flour for the widow
  By her using didn't fade.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Why be anxious for tomorrow?
  In your hand is what He gave.
Wherefore, try tomorrow's worries?
  Thank your God for what you have.
Love is living, life is giving,
  Spending doesn't wealth reduce.
When your small supply seems wasted,
  Then God's blessing's more profuse.</stanza>
