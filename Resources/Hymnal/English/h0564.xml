  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">I have learned the wondrous secret
  Of abiding in the Lord;
I have tasted life's pure fountain,
  I am drinking of His word;
I have found the strength and sweetness
  Of abiding 'neath the blood;
I have lost myself in Jesus,
  I am sinking into God.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">I'm abiding in the Lord
And confiding in His word;
I am hiding in the bosom of His love.
Yes, abiding in the Lord
And confiding in His word,
  I am hiding in the bosom of His love.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">I am crucified with Jesus,
  And He lives and dwells with me;
I have ceased from all my struggling,
  'Tis no longer I, but He.
All my will is yielding to Him,
  And His Spirit reigns within;
And His precious blood each moment
  Keeps me cleansed and free from sin.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">All my sicknesses I bring Him,
  And He bears them all away;
All my fears and griefs I tell Him,
  All my cares from day to day,
All my strength I draw from Jesus,
  By His breath I live and move;
E'en His very mind He gives me,
  And His faith, and life, and love.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">For my words I take His wisdom,
  For my works His Spirit's power;
For my ways His ceaseless presence
  Guards and guides me every hour.
Of my heart, He is the portion,
  Of my joy the boundless spring;
Savior, Sanctifier, Healer,
  Glorious Lord, and coming King.</stanza>
