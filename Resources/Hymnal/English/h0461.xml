  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Down in the valley with my Savior I would go,
Where the flowers are blooming and the sweet waters flow;
Everywhere He leads me I would follow, follow on,
Walking in His footsteps till the crown be won.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Follow! follow! I would follow Jesus!
Anywhere, everywhere, I would follow on!
Follow! follow! I would follow Jesus!
  Everywhere He leads me I would follow on!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Down in the valley with my Savior I would go,
Where the storms are sweeping and the dark waters flow;
With His hand to lead me I will never, never fear,
Dangers cannot fright me if my Lord is near.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Down in the valley, or upon the mountain steep,
Close beside my Savior would my heart ever keep;
He will lead me safely in the path that He has trod,
Up to where they gather in the rest of God.</stanza>
