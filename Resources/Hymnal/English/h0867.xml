  <lyrics>
	<stanza type="verse" number="1">As members of the Body
  Christ we would manifest,
Each learning how to function
  His fulness to express;
We would not be spectators
  But each as members move,
None bringing death or damage
  But each our profit prove.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">As in a team we'd never
  Act independently,
But in coordination,
  Each would dependent be;
Not acting by our choosing
  But following the flow,
Distraction never bringing,
  The Spirit's way we'd know.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">On Christ we here would focus,
  No other center make;
With Christ in sweet communion
  His riches to partake.
He is our Head and content,
  His Body we express;
Whate'er we do while meeting
  Himself must manifest.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">Built up in love together,
  Not one would criticize;
To perfect one another,
  We all would exercise.
Each one from self delivered,
  The natural life forsakes;
In grace each trained in spirit
  The Body-life partakes.</stanza>
