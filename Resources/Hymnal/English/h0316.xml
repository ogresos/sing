    <singingstanza>Some day the sil -- ver cord will break, And I no more as now shall sing; But, O the joy when I shall wake With -- in the pre -- sence of the King! And I shall see Him face to face, And tell the sto -- ry, saved by grace: And I shall see Him face to face, And tell the sto -- ry, saved by grace.</singingstanza>

    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Some day the silver cord will break,
And I no more as now shall sing;
But, O the joy when I shall wake
Within the presence of the King!</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">And I shall see Him face to face,
And tell the story, saved by grace:
And I shall see Him face to face,
  And tell the story, saved by grace.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Some day my earthly house will fall,
I cannot tell how soon 'twill be,
But this I know&amp;mdash;my All in all
Has now a place with Him for me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Or some day when my Lord will come,
And called to meet Him I'll be blest,
He then will say to me, "Well done,"
And I shall enter into rest.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Some day, till then I'll watch and wait,
My lamp all trimmed and burning bright,
That when my Savior I will greet,
My faith will then be changed to sight.</stanza>
