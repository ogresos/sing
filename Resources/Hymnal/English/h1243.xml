In the church we are broth -- ers, Praise the Lord, praise the Lord! In the church we are sis -- ters, Praise the Lord, praise the Lord! And we praise Him that our u -- ni -- ty has now been re -- stored.</singingstanza>

    <stanza type="verse" number="1">We are one in the spirit, by His life we are one,
We have left all divisions, Body-life has begun,
For the Lord broke all barriers, proclaiming,
  "It is done."</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Brothers:
In the church we are brothers,
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord!

Sisters:
In the church we are sisters,
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord!
  (Praise the Lord!)

Everyone:
And we praise Him that our unity
  has now been restored.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">We are one in the spirit, yet it goes deeper still,
For this oneness is spreading to our mind, emotion, will,
As we all stand together that His purpose He fulfill.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">We are one in the spirit, we are one actually,
Not in talk nor in theory, but in fact, practically,
In the churches we're all enjoying this reality.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">We are one in the spirit in each locality,
For the Lord's own intention we would consecrated be,
That the oneness He's given us the whole world may see.</stanza>
