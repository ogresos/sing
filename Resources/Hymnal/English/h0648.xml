  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Soldier, soldier, fighting in the world's great strife,
On thyself relying, battling for thy life;
  Trust thyself no longer,
  Trust to Christ&amp;mdash;He's stronger;
I can all things, all things do
Through Christ, which strengtheneth me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">In your daily duty, standing up for right,
Are you sometimes weary&amp;mdash;heart not always light?
  Doubt your Savior never,
  This your motto ever:
I can all things, all things do
Through Christ, which strengtheneth me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">If your way be weary He will help you through&amp;mdash;
Help you in your troubles and your pleasures too;
  Say, when Satan's by you;
  Say, when all things try you:
I can all things, all things do
Through Christ, which strengtheneth me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">In a world of trouble, tempted oft to stray,
You need never stumble, Satan cannot stay,
  Will but tempt you vainly,
  If you tell him plainly:
I can all things, all things do
Through Christ, which strengtheneth me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Jesus' power is boundless, boundless as the sea;
He is always able, able to keep me,
  Power bring from my weakness,
  Glory from my meekness:
I can all things, all things do
Through Christ, which strengtheneth me.</stanza>
