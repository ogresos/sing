    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Father, let Thy kingdom come,
Let it come with living power;
Speak at length the final word,
Usher in the triumph hour.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">As it came in days of old,
In the deepest hearts of men,
When Thy martyrs died for Thee,
Let it come, O God, again.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Tyrant thrones and idol shrines,
Let them from their place be hurled;
Enter on Thy better reign,
Wear the crown of this poor world.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Oh, what long, sad years have gone,
Since Thy Church was taught this prayer;
Oh, what eyes have watched and wept
For the dawning everywhere.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Break, triumphant day of God!
Break at last our hearts to cheer;
Throbbing souls and holy songs
Wait to hail Thy dawning here.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Empires, temples, scepters, thrones,
May they all for God be won;
And, in every human heart,
Father, let Thy kingdom come.</stanza>
