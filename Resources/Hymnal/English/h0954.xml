  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">There's a light upon the mountains,
  and the day is at the spring,
When our eyes shall see the beauty
  and the glory of the King;
Weary was our heart with waiting, and
  the night-watch seemed so long,
But His triumph-day is breaking, and
  we hail it with a song.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">In the fading of the starlight we can
  see the coming morn;
And the lights of men are paling in
  the splendors of the dawn;
For the eastern skies are glowing as
  with lights of hidden fire,
And the hearts of men are stirring
  with the throb of deep desire.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">There's a hush of expectation, and
  a quiet in the air;
And the breath of God is moving in
  the fervent breath of prayer;
For the suffering, dying Jesus is the
  Christ upon the throne,
And the travail of our spirit is the
  travail of His own.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">He is breaking down the barriers,
  He is casting up the way;
He is calling for His angels to build
  up the gates of day;
But His angels here are human, not
  the shining hosts above,
For the drum-beats of His army are
  the heart-beats of our love.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Hark! we hear a distant music, and
  it comes with fuller swell;
'Tis the triumph song of Jesus, of
  our King Emmanuel;
Zion, go ye forth to meet Him,
  and my soul, be swift to bring
All thy sweetest and thy dearest for
  the triumph of our King.</stanza>
