	<stanza type="verse" number="1">What He is: He's the Father.
He's the everlasting Father.
He's the firstborn of creation.
He's the One who lives inside of me.
He's the Father! Wonderful!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">What He is: He's the river.
He's the mighty flowing river.
He waters me in a desert land.
He's my hiding place; He is our man.
He's the river! Wonderful!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">What He is: He's the vine tree.
He's the branch, the root of Jesse.
He's the tree of life: we have the right
To eat of Him and have His life.
He's the vine tree! Wonderful!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">What He is: He's the Shepherd.
He's the lamb of God, the he-goat.
We rest and feed in the pasture land.
We strike the blood and eat the lamb.
He's the Shepherd! Wonderful!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">What He is: He's the Spirit.
He's the all-inclusive Spirit.
He's our everything; He's our all in all.
He gives life to us whene'er we call.
He's the Spirit! Wonderful!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">What He is: He's a Person.
He's a real and living Person.
He is living now inside of us.
This Person is so glorious.
He's a Person! Wonderful!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">What He is: He's the Body;
He's the fulness of the Godhead;
He's the center of the Father's plan,
Christ and the church, the one new man.
He is wonderful, wonderful.</stanza>
	<stanza type="chorus" number="">He is wonderful, wonderful.
He is wonderful, wonderful.</stanza>
