    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Through countless ages, many men
Have longed and sought and tried to see
The secret of the universe,
So vast, so great a mystery.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Yet not through struggling could frail man
The secret of this myst'ry find;
Nor chance, by stumbling, come upon
Such hidden things&amp;mdash;to these he's blind.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Behold in heav'n a throne is set,
And One upon the throne revealed;
And held in His right hand a scroll&amp;mdash;
The mystery is tightly sealed.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Through all the universe, a cry&amp;mdash;
'Can one be found of such great worth
The scroll to take?' ... yet no reply,
From heav'n, below, or on the earth.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Were it a matter now for man
By chance, or some ability,
Then surely one would now step forth
To open God's economy.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Yet sad and solemn was that sight.
John wept as then he looked around;
And we, too, still might weeping be
If none at all were worthy found.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">But then the angel said, 'Weep not!
Behold, the Lion has prevailed
To take the scroll and loose its seals;
He has the mystery now unveiled!'</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">So, John looked up the Lion to see,
But, lo, he then beheld a Lamb;
Christ both o'ercame the enemy,
And wrought redemption's work for man.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="9">The angels fall before His throne,
Four living creatures offer praise,
All glory to the Lion-Lamb;
Let us with theirs our voices raise!</stanza>
