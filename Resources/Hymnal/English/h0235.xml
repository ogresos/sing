    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Praise Him! praise Him! Jesus, our blessed Redeemer!
  Sing, ye saints! His wonderful love proclaim!
Hail Him! hail Him! mightiest angels in glory;
  Strength and honor give to His holy name!
Like a shepherd, Jesus will feed His people,
  In His arms He carries them all day long;
O ye saints that live in the light of His presence,
  Praise Him! praise Him! ever in joyful song!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Praise Him! praise Him! Jesus, our blessed Redeemer,
  For our sins He suffered and bled and died;
He, our Rock, our Hope of eternal salvation,
  Hail Him! hail Him! Jesus, the Crucified;
Loving Savior, meekly enduring sorrow,
  Crowned with thorns that cruelly pierced His brow;
Once for us rejected, despised, and forsaken,
  Prince of Glory, ever triumphant now.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Praise Him! praise Him! Jesus, our blessed Redeemer,
  Heavenly portals, loud with hosannahs ring!
Jesus, Savior, reigneth for ever and ever;
  Crown Him! crown Him! Prophet and Priest and King!
Death is vanquished! Tell it with joy, ye faithful,
  Where is now thy victory, boasting grave?
Jesus lives! No longer thy portals are cheerless;
  Jesus lives, the mighty and strong to save.</stanza>
