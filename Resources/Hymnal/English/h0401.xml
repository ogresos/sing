    <stanza type="verse" number="1">May the mind of Christ my Savior
Live in me from day to day,
By His love and pow'r controlling
  All I do and say.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">May the Word of Christ dwell richly
In my heart from hour to hour,
So that all may see I triumph
  Only through His pow'r.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">May the peace of Christ my Savior
Rule my life in every thing,
That I may be calm to comfort
  Sick and sorrowing.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">May the love of Jesus fill me,
As the waters fill the sea;
Him exalting, self abasing,
  This is victory.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">May I run the race before me,
Strong and brave to face the foe,
Looking only unto Jesus
  As I onward go.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">May His beauty rest upon me
As I seek the lost to win,
And may they forget the channel,
  Seeing only Him.</stanza>
