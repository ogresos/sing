    <stanza type="verse" number="1">In daily walk and in our meetings too,
Christ is the center, Christ is everything;
'Tis not for form nor doctrine good and true,
But 'tis for Christ alone we're gathering.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Christ is the way and Christ the light of life,
In Him we walk and by Him we are led;
Christ is the living water and the food;
Of Him we drink and we with Him are fed.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Christ is the truth, 'tis Him we testify,
Christ is the life, 'tis Him we minister;
Christ is the Lord, 'tis Him we magnify,
Christ is the Head, and we exalt Him here.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Christ is the All in all to God and man&amp;mdash;
With Him both we and God are satisfied;
Christ, the reality within the Church&amp;mdash;
By Him are life and numbers multiplied.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">By all the hymns and prayers we offer here,
Christ the reality we would express;
All the activities in fellowship&amp;mdash;
Christ thus in operation manifest.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">'Tis in His Name we meet, in Spirit act,
With nothing in our mind to formalize;
'Tis by His pow'r we pray, in unction praise,
And with Himself in spirit exercise.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">All things forgetting, cleaving unto Christ,
Applying Him until maturity;
Let us count everything but loss for Him,
For Him, our All in all, eternally.</stanza>
