    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Oh, listen to the wanderer
In whom there was a lack;
Then hearken to the song he sings
And follow in his track.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Praise the Lord, Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
  I'll never be the same!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">A wanderer within the world
For pleasure ever seeks;
Be it in body or in mind,
With vanity it reeks.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">For self I labored day and night,
My castles built in sand;
But, praise the Lord, He wrecked them all&amp;mdash;
Much better things He planned.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Once all for self&amp;mdash;confused, alone,
How could I bear the shame?
But now within the local church
I'll never be the same.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">I am a happy member now
Within the local church.
A wanderer has found his home
And ended all his search.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">I was an individualist,
An island in myself;
But now the Lord is building me
With others in Himself.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">I'm drawn together with His own
In fellowship so sweet.
I've learned from others to receive
Of Christ whene'er we meet.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">My wanderings have really ceased&amp;mdash;
I've found the church, God's best!
The secret of my happiness&amp;mdash;
Enjoying God's own rest!</stanza>
