    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Now in a song of grateful praise,
To Thee, O Lord, my voice I'll raise;
With all Thy saints I'll join to tell,
My Savior has done all things well.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">And above the rest this note shall swell,
This note shall swell, this note shall swell,
And above the rest this note shall swell,
  My Savior has done all things well.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">How sov'reign, wonderful and free,
Has been Thy love to sinful me!
Thou sav'dst me from the jaws of hell;
My Savior has done all things well.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Since e'er my soul has known His love,
What mercies He has made me prove,
Mercies which do all praise excel,
My Savior has done all things well.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">And when on that bright day I rise,
And join the anthems of the skies,
Above the rest this note shall swell,
My Savior has done all things well.</stanza>
