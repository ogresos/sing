  <lyrics>
	<stanza type="verse" number="1">God's own Word must not be taken
  Just as knowledge but as life,
Not alone God's thought conveying,
  But Himself to us as life;
Not alone God's mind revealing,
  But His Christ as life within,
Not alone the teaching giving,
  But experience of Him.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">It is only knowledge to us
  If we in the letter read,
But when reading in the spirit
  It is truly life indeed.
All the knowledge in the letter
  Only brings us into death,
But the Word in spirit taken
  Gives to us the quickening breath.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">If we miss the Lord in Scripture,
  It is just as knowledge vain;
But when Christ we touch within it,
  Then His life we may obtain.
When we read, the Lord not touching,
  'Tis but mental stimulus;
But when Christ we touch by reading,
  It becometh life in us.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">All the knowledge of the Scriptures
  Into life must be transformed,
All the mental understanding
  In the spirit must be formed;
All the Scriptural understanding
  Must become the life received,
All the knowledge of the letters
  In the spirit be conceived.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">Just to touch the Word for knowledge
  Is to take the very way
By which Eve was lured by Satan
  And by knowledge led astray;
But as life to take the Scripture
  Is the tree of life to eat;
Thus the Word we must be taking
  In the spirit as our meat.</stanza>
