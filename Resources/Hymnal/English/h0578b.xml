  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">My will is weak, my strength is frail,
And all my hope is nearly gone;
I can but trust Thy working true
To gently hold and lead me on.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">I've tried my best, but still have failed,
E'en as before I've failed and erred;
Thy patience is my only trust
To hold and keep me to Thy word.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Whene'er my heart is lifted up,
How very near I am to fall;
I dare not do, I dare not think,
I need Thyself in great or small.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Thou art my Savior, strength and stay,
O Lord, I come to seek Thy face;
Though I'm the weakest of the weak,
My strength is nothing but Thy grace.</stanza>
