    <stanza type="verse" number="1">I belong to Jesus;
  I am not my own;
All I have and all I am
  Shall be His alone.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">I belong to Jesus;
  He is Lord and King,
Reigning in my inmost heart
  Over everything.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">I belong to Jesus;
  What can hurt or harm,
When He folds around my soul
  His almighty Arm?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">I belong to Jesus;
  Blessed, blessed thought!
With His own most precious blood
  Has my soul been bought.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">I belong to Jesus;
  He has died for me;
I am His and He is mine
  Through eternity.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">I belong to Jesus;
  He will keep my soul,
If the deathly waters dark
  Round about me roll.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">I belong to Jesus;
  And ere long I'll be
With my precious Savior there
  In His royalty.</stanza>
