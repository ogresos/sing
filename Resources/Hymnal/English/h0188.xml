    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Dear Lord, Thou art the Son of God,
  His absolute expression;
In Thee God speaks to us today,
  Thou art His definition.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">The impress of God's substance true,
  Effulgence of His glory,
Thou even art our God Himself,
  In Thee is His full story.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">By Thee was made the universe,
  Subsisting by Thy merit;
The heir, God hath appointed Thee,
  That all Thou may inherit.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Since Thou hast purged our sins by death,
  In heaven Thou art seated,
Till all Thy foes will be subdued
  And all God's will completed.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">A better name than angels have,
  From God Thou didst inherit;
As Son of God to us as life,
  Thou now art in the Spirit.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Thy kingdom is of righteousness,
  Thy throne will stand forever;
God hath in love anointed Thee,
  And Thou shalt wax old never.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Thou also art a man indeed,
  With all our human nature;
By grace Thou tastedst death for us
  That we may have Thy stature.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">With glory and with honor crowned,
  All things to Thee are subject;
As Captain of salvation, full,
  Thou art thru sufferings perfect.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="9">By death the devil Thou hast spoiled,
  And from death's bondage freed us;
Thou sanctifiest us in life
  And dost to glory speed us.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="10">To us, Thy brethren, Thou art here,
  The Father's Name declaring;
Within the Church Thou singest hymns,
  God's praises with us sharing.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="11">Superior Thou to Moses, Lord,
  As to the house the builder;
Thou, our Apostle sent from God,
  Art worthy of more splendor.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="12">Thou art our real Joshua,
  By Thee the rest we enter;
Our full salvation is of Thee,
  Our faith on Thee doth center.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="13">Thou art the heav'nly rest to us,
  Now dwelling in our spirit,
For us to enter as the land
  And all Thy good inherit.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="14">Superior Thou to Aaron too&amp;mdash;
  Thyself, the offering given,
Thou enteredst, as our Great High Priest,
  The holiest place in heaven.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="15">Thou art our true Melchisedec,
  With endless life in power,
To minister the "bread and wine,"
  In every needful hour.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="16">Thou art the better sacrifice,
  Thru the eternal Spirit,
Once offered unto God for us,
  That we may gain Thy merit.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="17">A better covenant was made
  With Thy dear blood in heaven;
By Thee this sure new testament
  To Thy redeemed was given.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="18">Thou art its Maker adequate,
  For Thou dost have the merit;
Thou art its Giver competent
  That we may all inherit;</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="19">Its qualified Executor,
  By life of resurrection;
Its potent Mediator too,
  Fulfilling God's election.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="20">Lord, Thou art now within the veil,
  As our unique Forerunner,
That by Thy life, without the camp,
  We'll in the race be runners.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="21">Thou art the Finisher of faith,
  As well its Author perfect;
By faith and love we follow Thee,
  And e'er to Thee are subject.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="22">Unequaled is Thy worth, dear Lord,
  And all Thou art we treasure;
Thou art so perfect and complete,
  Beyond all human measure.</stanza>
