  <lyrics>
	<stanza type="verse" number="1">Lo, the glory! Lo, the splendor!
  Heaven's Kingdom manifest!
And its glorious King, our Master,
  Is by God's appointment blest.
Once in flesh He came so lowly,
  Hated and despised by man;
Now He comes again in glory
  To fulfill the Kingdom plan.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">Going to receive the Kingdom
  From His God, the Ancient of Days,
Now He cometh with the Kingdom
  And its glorious, ruling rays.
He's "the Stone" which breaks the nations
  Into pieces lowliest,
Which "a mountain great" becometh
  As the Kingdom manifest.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">Lo, the earth, all lands and kingdoms,
  By the Lord and Christ possessed;
Earth beneath their sovereign ruling
  Will be full of peace and rest.
No more war and no more hatred
  'Twixt the nations will there be;
But God's knowledge shall suffuse them
  As the waters fill the sea.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">All the Christian overcomers
  Shall with Christ in glory reign,
And the remnant saved of Israel
  Then God's priesthood shall obtain.
As God's people shall the nations
  'Neath their rule and teaching be,
And a glorious restoration
  All creation then shall see.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">Satan will be bound and banished;
  From his rule will earth be freed;
With Christ's sovereign reign and headship
  Earth will then be blessed indeed.
All to Christ will then be subject,
  To His pow'r and to His will;
As the Head and Center glorious,
  He God's purpose will fulfill.</stanza>
