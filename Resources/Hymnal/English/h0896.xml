    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Go, labor on; spend, and be spent;
  Thy joy to do the Father's will;
It is the way the Master went;
  Should not the servant tread it still?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Go, labor on: 'tis not for nought;
  Thy earthly loss is heav'nly gain;
Men heed thee, love thee, praise thee not;
  The Master praises, what are men?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Go, labor on; your hands are weak,
  Your knees are faint, your souls cast down;
Yet falter not; the prize you seek
  Is near, a kingdom and a crown.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Go, labor on while it is day,
  The world's dark night is hastening on;
Speed, speed thy work, cast sloth away,
  It is not thus that souls are won.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Men die in darkness at your side,
  Without a hope to cheer the tomb;
Take up the torch and wave it wide,
  The torch that lights time's thickest gloom.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Press on, faint not, keep watch and pray;
  Be wise the erring soul to win;
Go forth into the world's highway,
  Compel the wanderer to come in.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Press on, and in thy work rejoice;
  For work comes rest, the prize thus won;
Soon shalt thou hear the Master's voice,
  The midnight cry, Behold, I come!</stanza>
