    <stanza type="verse" number="1">This day the Lord has spoken,
  This day my choice is made:
I will be all for Jesus,
  Who all for me has paid.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Now His shall be the empire,
  In all things over me;
And I will be His bond slave,
  Yet gloriously free.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">From henceforth, owning nothing,
  I cannot lose at all;
I cannot well be poorer,
  Whatever may befall.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Yet could I not be richer,
  If I the world should gain;
For heav'n and earth shall perish,
  But Jesus will remain.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">And He will be my treasure,
  And He my boundless store;
And those who live on Jesus,
  Will never hunger more.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Though I am utter weakness,
  In Him I shall prevail;
And though my love may falter,
  Yet His will never fail.</stanza>
