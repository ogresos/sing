	<stanza type="verse" number="1">Christ to me is so subjective,
  In my spirit dwelleth He;
Christ to me is all-inclusive,
  As the Spirit one with me.</stanza>
	<stanza type="chorus" number="">So subjective is my Christ to me!
  Real in me, and rich and sweet!
All-inclusive is my Christ to me!
    All my needs He fully meets.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">Christ to me is so subjective,
  Life imparting all the way;
As the Spirit He revives me
  And refreshes day by day.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">Christ to me is so subjective,
  All my being He transforms;
By the mind and will renewing
  To His image He conforms.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">Christ to me is so subjective,
  Liberating pow'r is He,
By the law of life and power
  As the Spirit setting free.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">Christ to me is so subjective,
  Regulating all the day;
He corrects and rules and guides me,
  And adjusts in every way.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">Christ to me is so subjective,
  All my thirst He satisfies;
With His riches He supplies me,
  Thus God's fulness testifies.</stanza>
