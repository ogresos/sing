    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Thy blueprint, Lord, I treasure dear,
It shows Thy tabernacle real,
It tells how Thou wouldst have it built,
How Thou Thy glory wouldst reveal.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">The ark's the center of the tent,
The tent is but its resting-place:
In it the ten commandments are,
And in the tent it ever stays.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">The ark the God-man, Christ, displays&amp;mdash;
God mixed with man, as gold, wood meet;
The law is God's expression full,
Which dwells in Christ the Son complete.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Thus Christ's the center of the Church,
Which is to Him a resting-place;
In Christ the Father ever dwells,
And in the Church, Christ's dwelling-place.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">The tent's the increase of the ark,
Both are of wood with gold o'erlaid;
The Church the increase is of Christ,
God blent with man here too displayed.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">The boards when joined support the tent
On silver sockets standing sure;
Gold overlaid, with golden rings
And interlocking bars, secure.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">The Church is thus the gathered saints,
On Christ's redemption standing sure;
In life divine, by Spirit bound,
Together built and framed secure.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">The tent's four-layered cover shows
The Christ of God in every phase;
God's glory thus is signified,
Covering His holy dwelling-place.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="9">Covered by such a glorious Christ,
All saints together knit may be;
Enjoying all He is for them,
In Him they're builded gloriously.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="10">The law is placed within the ark,
The ark within the tent doth rest;
So God in Christ within the Church
His wondrous glory manifests.</stanza>
