  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">The Lord has been revealed in us,
The kingdom-seed so glorious;
He's planted deeper than our heart,
And from us He will ne'er depart.
This seed is never satisfied
Just in our spirits to abide;
He wants to grow and spread today
To live in us in every way.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">We're like a glove, an empty man,
So meaningless without a hand;
Lord, saturate each inward part
And form Yourself in all our heart.
The Lord must spread into our mind,
Our natural thoughts and concepts bind;
Imaginations, dreams be gone,
The kingdom-seed in us is sown!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">In our emotions He must grow;
Raw, fragile feelings overthrow;
Our love, our hatred, must be His&amp;mdash;
Lord, we agree with You for this.
Another part the Lord must fill&amp;mdash;
Our hard, unbending, stubborn will;
Lord, our resistance quickly break,
Subdue us for Thy kingdom's sake.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Our conscience too the Lord must clear,
That we may walk in godly fear;
Our conscience must be keen today,
Else we cannot the Lord obey.
'Tis by His growing, spreading thus,
The Lord will have His home in us;
A place on earth where He is Lord,
Full rights to Him we will afford.</stanza>
