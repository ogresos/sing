	<stanza type="verse" number="1">Down at the cross where my Savior died,
God's righteous nature was satisfied;
There to my sin was the blood applied,
  Glory to His name!</stanza>
	<stanza type="chorus" number="">Glory to His name,
Glory to His name;
There to my sin was the blood applied,
  Glory to His name!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">Saved from our sin at this fountain, we
Fully enjoy our redemption free;
This we'll enjoy for eternity,
  Glory to His name!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">Oh, precious fact, when my Savior died,
Not only sin's debt was satisfied;
Life's flowing fountain was opened wide!
  Glory to His name!</stanza>
	<stanza type="chorus" number="">Glory to His name,
Glory to His name;
Life's flowing fountain was opened wide,
  Glory to His name!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">Now both redemption and life we share,
Cleansed in His blood, we're abiding there
Drinking the water of life fore'er;
  Glory to His name!</stanza>
