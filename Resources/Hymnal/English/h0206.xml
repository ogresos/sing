	<stanza type="verse" number="1">O Christ, He is the fountain,
  The deep, sweet well of life:
Its living streams I've tasted
  Which save from grief and strife.
And to an ocean fulness,
  His mercy doth expand;
His grace is all-sufficient
  As by His wisdom planned.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">O I am my Beloved's,
  And my Beloved's mine;
He brings a poor vile sinner
  Into His house of wine!
I stand upon His merit;
  I know no other stand.
I'm hidden in His presence
  And held by His own hand.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">The Bride eyes not her garment,
  But her dear Bridegroom's face;
I will not gaze at glory,
  But on my King of grace:
Not at the crown He giveth,
  But on His pierced hand;
The Lamb is all the glory,
  And my eternal stand!</stanza>
