  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Many crowd the Savior's kingdom,
  Few receive His cross;
Many seek His consolation,
  Few will suffer loss.
For the dear sake of the Master,
  Counting all but dross,
For the dear sake of the Master,
  Counting all but dross.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Many sit at Jesus' table,
  Few will fast with Him,
When the sorrow-cup of anguish
  Trembles to the brim.
Few watch with Him in the garden,
  Who have sung the hymn,
Few watch with Him in the garden,
  Who have sung the hymn.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Many will confess His wisdom,
  Few embrace His shame.
Many, should He smile upon them,
  Will His praise proclaim;
Then, if for a while He leave them,
  They desert His name,
Then, if for a while He leave them,
  They desert His name.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">But the souls who love Him truly,
  Let woe come or bliss,
These will count their dearest hearts' blood
  Not their own, but His.
Savior, Thou who thus hast loved me,
  Give me love like this,
Savior, Thou who thus hast loved me,
  Give me love like this.</stanza>
