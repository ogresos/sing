  <lyrics>
	<stanza type="verse" number="1">In dealings with the Lord as life
  We need a proper heart,
That of His riches, in His grace,
  We fully may take part.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">We need a heart in all things pure,
  With mind both sound and clear,
To understand His mind and heart
  In trembling and in fear.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">We need a fervent, loving heart,
  A heart on fire with love,
With an emotion filled with zeal
  For Him, all else above.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">We need a true, obedient heart,
  With a submissive will,
A will made pliable, yet strong,
  God's purpose to fulfill.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">We need a heart condemning not,
  In all things right with God;
A heart which has a conscience purged
  And covered with the blood.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">Lord, grant us such a heart as this,
  Forever fixed on Thee,
That of Thyself we may partake
  And Thy true fulness be.</stanza>
