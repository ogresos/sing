  <copyright>Copyright claimed - Wild Mountain Thyme, also known as Will You Go Lassie, Go, is a folk song, originally written by the McKenna family in the early part of the 20th century but was made famous in 1957 by William McPeake and his son Francis McPeake, natives of Ulster, Ireland. It is often mistakenly believed to be a traditional song, but the copyright is held by E.F.D.S.S. Publications, who published it for McPeake. It was first recorded by Francis McPeake in 1957...." [Wikipedia] BUT words clearly derived from "The Braes of Balquhidder" (found in ""Songs of Scotland"", edited by George Farquhar Graham printed circa 1850); tune origins unclear.</copyright>

  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">My wandering days grew increasingly empty
As I searched for the way,
Just to fill this gap inside me&amp;mdash;
Found my seeking vain.
Though all this dark earth would convince me
    life's worthwhile,
Inside all my mirth
Was a cry for something real.
Don't you lie to me, world!</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">For my heart tells me different
When I hear of contentment
Deep within a lack knew better
  Why not be honest, world.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">A flood of strong doubt as I heard the old story
Of a man they called Lord;
Yet my heart ne'er ceased to wonder,
Is He really Lord?
A search in His Word found my hardened
    heart softened,
And earth's vanities faded.
In the brightness of His presence
Jesus came into me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Now we're always together
Growing into God's fullness.
O Lord Jesus, how I love You!
  You brought life into me.</stanza>
