  <lyrics>
	<stanza type="verse" number="1">In those regenerated by the Lord
There is an inner knowledge bountiful;
Thus we the outward teachings do not need,
But God we inwardly may know in full.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">Eternal life, the highest and the best,
Possesses full divine capacity,
That by this life God's knowledge we may have
More than by knowledge given outwardly.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">The law of life is put within our mind
And on our heart 'tis written sovereignly,
Inwardly ruling us that God we know
More than by teachings given outwardly.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">Holy anointing in our spirit dwells,
Showing the things of God to mind and heart;
By this anointing we God's knowledge have
More than man's teachings can to us impart.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">We have the triune God indwelling us,
Living and acting, working all the time,
That by the inner sense we have of Him
God we may know in magnitude sublime.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">This inner knowledge obviates the need
Of outward knowledge, human eloquence,
But in the spirit we must ever live
And walk according to the inner sense.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">The more we live in Christ, the life divine,
And by the inner consciousness behave,
The more we'll have the inward knowledge true,
And on our heart God will His Son engrave.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="8">'Tis by this living inward knowledge gained
That fellowship with God in life we hold;
'Tis by this hidden knowledge thus obtained
God unto us His fulness doth unfold.</stanza>
