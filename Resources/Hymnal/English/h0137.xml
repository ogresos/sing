    <stanza type="verse" number="1">All hail the pow'r of Jesus' name!
  Before Him prostrate fall;
With one accord His praise proclaim,
  And crown Him Lord of all!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Ye saints redeemed from Adam's race,
  Ye ransomed from the fall,
Hail Him who saves you by His grace,
  And crown Him Lord of all.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Tell forth the only Name that's giv'n
  On which we now may call,
The Name adored by hosts in heav'n,
  And crown Him Lord of all.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">In glory all the ransomed throng
  Soon at His feet shall fall;
Join in the blest eternal song,
  And crown Him Lord of all.</stanza>
