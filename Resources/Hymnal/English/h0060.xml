    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Of the Father's love begotten,
  Ere the worlds began to be,
He is Alpha and Omega,
  He the source, the ending He,
Of the things that are and have been,
  And that future years shall see,
    Evermore and evermore.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">This is He whom they in old time
  Chanted of with one accord,
Whom the voices of the prophets
  Promised in their faithful word;
Now He shines, the long-expected;
  Let creation praise its Lord,
    Evermore and evermore.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">O ye heights of heav'n, adore Him;
  Angel hosts, His praises sing;
All dominions, bow before Him,
  And extol our Lord and King.
Let no tongue on earth be silent,
  Every voice in concert ring,
    Evermore and evermore.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Christ, to Thee, with God the Father,
  And, with Holy Ghost, to Thee,
Hymn and chant and high thanksgiving,
  And unwearied praises be;
Honor, glory, and dominion,
  And eternal victory,
    Evermore and evermore.</stanza>
