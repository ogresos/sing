    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Have you felt the Father's love?
  Still there's more to follow;
And His mercy have you proved?
  Still there's more to follow.
Oh, the love the Father shows,
  Still there's more to follow;
Freely He His love bestows,
  Still there's more to follow.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">More and more, more and more,
  Always more to follow;
Oh, His matchless, boundless love,
    Still there's more to follow.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Have you felt the Savior near?
  Still there's more to follow;
Does His blessed presence cheer?
  Still there's more to follow.
Oh, the grace that Jesus shows,
  Still there's more to follow;
Freely He His grace bestows,
  Still there's more to follow.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Have you felt the Spirit's power?
  Still there's more to follow;
Falling like the gentle shower?
  Still there's more to follow.
Oh, the power the Spirit shows,
  Still there's more to follow;
Freely He His power bestows,
  Still there's more to follow.</stanza>
