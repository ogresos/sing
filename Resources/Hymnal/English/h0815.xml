	<stanza type="verse" number="1">Christ is the Word and Spirit too,
  And as the Spirit in the Word;
And all the words He speaks to us
  Are life and spirit thus conferred.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">The Holy Word we have without,
  The Holy Spirit is within;
The greatest gifts divine are these,
  That we may God enjoy therein.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">The Word the Spirit doth express,
  The Spirit its reality;
They're but two aspects of one thing
  And should not separated be.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">Whene'er the Spirit lights the Word
  The Word becometh life to us;
When Word from Spirit is divorced,
  'Tis empty mental stimulus.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">When we the Word in spirit touch,
  As life the Spirit it becomes;
The Spirit, when expressed from us,
  As words of life to others comes.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">Our spirit we must exercise
  To take the Word most inwardly,
And then to give the Spirit forth;
  The two as one with us should be.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">Lord, may Thy Word in me become
  The Spirit as my life supply,
And may Thy Spirit in Thy Word
  My true expression be thereby.</stanza>
