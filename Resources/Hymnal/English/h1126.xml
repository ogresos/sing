    <stanza type="verse" number="1">O Jesus Lord, we come to Thee,
Thy presence to enjoy;
Our entrance now with boldness is,
As we Thy blood employ.
Not by our merit do we stand,
Nor in our righteousness,
Thy blood and righteousness we need;
Their worth we now confess.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Thy judgments, Lord, we must admit,
Are holy, righteous, fair.
We own our sins as crimson are,
We've no excuse to bear.
We've no argument, no plea;
No veil our sin can hide.
But, praise Thee, Lord, Thy precious blood
Is to our sin applied!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">God has not overlooked our sin,
But judged it once for all;
His righteous fury, not on us,
But on His Lamb did fall.
A new and living way is made&amp;mdash;
We stand on legal ground;
Our Surety and our Substitute
Has pardon for us found.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">O Jesus Lord, we worship Thee,
Redemption now enjoy;
Thy precious blood again we see,
Its virtue now employ.
Dear Lord, Thy mercy is so vast,
Unlimited and free.
Oh, Lamb of God, we'll sing Thy praise,
Through all eternity!</stanza>
