    <stanza type="verse" number="1">"Be all at rest, my soul!" Oh! blessed secret
  Of the true life that glorifies thy Lord;
Not always doth the busiest soul best serve Him,
  But he who resteth on His faithful word.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">"Be all at rest!" for rest is highest service;
  To the still heart God doth His secrets tell;
Thus shalt thou learn to wait, and watch, and labor,
  Strengthened to bear, since Christ in thee doth dwell.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">"Be all at rest!" for rest alone becometh
  The soul that casts on Him its every care;
"Be all at rest!" so shall thy life proclaim Him
  A God who worketh and who heareth prayer.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">"Be all at rest!" so shalt thou be an answer
  To those who question, "Who is God, and where?"
For God is rest, and where He dwells is stillness,
  And they who dwell in Him that rest shall share.</stanza>
