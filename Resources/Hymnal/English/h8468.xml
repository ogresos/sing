  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">If I would only stray a bit,
Then ease my lot would be;
But I recall how Christ my Lord
Did suffer faithfully.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">The world I have forever left
And severed all its ties;
The way may yet more narrow grow
And all against me rise.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">But though the worldlings glare in rage;
I seek His smiling face.
Though outward glory others choose,
I, His "well done" through grace.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">My heart's desire is not for fame
Nor profit in these days;
I humbly wish to serve my Lord
And gain that day His praise.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Unto the judgment seat of Christ
I daily look away;
May all my living and my work
Abide the fire that day.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">You may your reputation hold,
Wealth, friends, and glory gain;
You may win all success and praise,
A following great obtain.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">But I would be but lonely, poor,
With no prosperity;
My heart desires to follow Him
And finish faithfully.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">My Lord, when here on earth, I know,
Gained nothing but the cross.
I only hope to be like Him
And for Him suffer loss.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="9">My glory's in the coming age,
Today I'll patient be.
I'd ne'er enjoy ahead of Him
This world's prosperity.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="10">That day I shall receive the crown,
He'll wipe away my tears.
So faithfully I'll journey on
Till He at length appears.</stanza>
