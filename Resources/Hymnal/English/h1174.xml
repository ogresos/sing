	<stanza type="verse" number="1">What a victory! What a triumph!
God Himself became a man,
Clothed Himself in human nature
To fulfill His mighty plan.
He through death destroyed the devil;
Risen now, the Son of Man!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">Jesus by His human virtues
Did the subtle one arrest;
He as man withstood the tempter,
Fully passed through every test.
Now in spirit I can take Him,
All His virtues to possess.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">In the Spirit of this Jesus
Is His human life so fine.
Human virtues have been added
To the Spirit all divine.
What abundance in this Spirit,
Rich supply for all mankind!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">How mysterious! Yet how real!
Such a man now lives in me.
Into all my heart He's spreading&amp;mdash;
He, my human life, to be.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
I will praise unceasingly.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">Oh, what wonder! Oh, how glorious!
God in flesh is manifest.
We the members of His Body
His humanity express.
For the building of God's dwelling
We His human life possess.</stanza>
