    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Once I stood in condemnation,
  Waiting thus the sinner's doom;
Christ in death has wrought salvation,
  God has raised Him from the tomb.
Once I was to God a stranger,
  Filled with enmity and fear;
He has rescued me from danger,
  Love revealed and brought me near.
He has rescued me from danger,
  Love revealed and brought me near.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Now I see in Christ's acceptance
  But the measure of my own;
He who lay beneath my sentence,
  Seated high upon the Throne.
Quickened, raised, and in Him seated,
  I a full deliverance know;
Every foe has been defeated,
  Every enemy laid low,
Every foe has been defeated,
  Every enemy laid low.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Now I have a life in union
  With the risen Lord above;
Now I drink in sweet communion
  Some rich foretaste of His love.
Soon, O Lord! in highest glory,
  All its vastness I'll explore;
Soon I'll cast my crown before Thee,
  While I worship and adore,
Soon I'll cast my crown before Thee,
  While I worship and adore.</stanza>
