	<stanza type="verse" number="1">Christ the Savior hath ascended
  To the heavens far above,
Crowned with glory and with honor
  By the Father God in love;
He hath made Him Head of all things,
  His supremacy to prove.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">From this Christ to God ascended
  Hath the Spirit been outpoured,
Poured upon the Church, His Body,
  That His members be empow'red;
Thus the Lord of all in heaven
  Thru His Church will be adored.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">In the flesh by incarnation,
  Into man He God hath brought;
By His death and resurrection,
  Into God He man hath brought;
God and man together mingled,
  In Himself is fully wrought.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">Now in heaven by ascension
  He is seated on the throne;
All the lordship, all the headship,
  He Himself doth fully own;
And by pouring out His Spirit,
  He as such might be made known.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">By this outpour, His descension
  On the Church was realized;
'Tis by this, that in His Spirit
  All the Church He hath baptized;
Thus the baptism of the Spirit
  Was forever actualized.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">Hallelujah, 'tis accomplished,
  And accomplished once for all!
Hallelujah, we're included,
  All included, great or small!
Praise Him, He hath sent the Spirit
  And baptized the Church withal!</stanza>
