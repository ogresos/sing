    <stanza type="verse" number="1">"With one accord" within an upper room
The faithful followers of Jesus met:
One was the hope of every waiting soul,
And on one object great each heart was set.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">"With one accord," until the mighty gift
Of pentecostal power was outpoured;
Then forth as witnesses possessed of God,
To preach the resurrection of the Lord!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">"With one accord" within the house of God
A hallelujah song is daily raised,
As with the voice of one, from vocal hearts
Christ Jesus' name is glorified and praised.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Pour down Thy Spirit once again, dear Lord;
Our cry goes up to Thee for "latter rain";
Unite Thy people as the "heart of one,"
And pentecostal days shall come again!</stanza>
