    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Come, let us sing the song of songs,
The saints of old began the strain,
The blessing which to Christ belongs:
Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Slain to redeem us by His blood,
To cleanse from every sinful stain;
And make us kings and priests to God;
Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Long as we live, and should we die,
And while in light with Him we reign,
This song our song of songs shall be:
Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!</stanza>
