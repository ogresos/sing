	<stanza type="verse" number="1">Of Him whence grace and truth did spring,
We're at the fountain drinking;
This Christ we'll ever praise and sing,
Here in the church, His home!</stanza>
	<stanza type="chorus" number="">Glory to God! We're at the fountain drinking!
Glory to God! We're in the church, our home!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">Ask but His grace, and lo, 'tis giv'n,
We're at the fountain drinking;
Seek but Himself, the heaven of heaven,
And find Him here at home!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">Though Satan fights with all his power,
We're at the fountain drinking;
He'll not prevail, not one short hour,
Against the church, our home!</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">Athirst we to this spring do fly,
We're at the fountain drinking;
Drink deep, this well will not run dry!
It's in the church, our home!</stanza>
