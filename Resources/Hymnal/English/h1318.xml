    <stanza type="verse" number="1">'Twas a day in early springtime,
By an ancient wayside well,
Eliezer paused to rest his camel train.
He had found a bride for Isaac
Ere the evening shadows fell,
For his weary journey had not been in vain.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Oh, get ready! Evening shadows fall.
Don't you hear the Eliezer call?
There's going to be a wedding,
And our joy will soon begin,
  In the evening when the camel train comes in.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">So he took the fair Rebekah,
Dressed in jewels rich and rare,
Quickly to her waiting bridegroom far away.
Where Rebekah loved her Isaac,
And he loved Rebekah fair;
Oh, it must have been a happy wedding day.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Now the blessed Holy Spirit,
From our Father God above,
Has come down to earth to find a worthy Bride.
For our Isaac over yonder
Has prepared His tents of love,
And He wants His fair Rebekah by His side.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">We have left our kinfolk gladly;
We have bade the world goodbye.
We've been called to be His pure and spotless Bride;
Where we'll soon behold our Jesus
In that blest eternity&amp;mdash;
What a happy, happy wedding that will be!</stanza>
