	<stanza type="verse" number="1">In Eden's garden fair we see
That God before two trees placed man,
The trees of life, and knowledge too,
Which for the Lord and Satan stand.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">The tree of life the center is
Of God's eternal, perfect plan,
Denoting God in Christ as life
To be received as all by man.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">The tree of knowledge standing there,
Bespeaks a sure and warning voice:
Outside of God there is a source
Of death to all who make this choice.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">If man would eat the tree of life,
Then God as life he will receive,
And be transformed to precious stones,
God's will and Purpose to achieve.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">If man the tree of knowledge takes,
Then Satan enters into man
As sin, which brings him into death,
That he may not fulfill God's plan.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">This signifies that only God
Is our full source of life and breath;
To touch ought else is but to touch
The source of knowledge and of death.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">For knowledge only bringeth death,
Though evil or though good it seem;
For any thing apart from God,
Is but the fruit of Satan's scheme.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="8">Not only evil, but the good
Is contradictory to Christ;
Not only knowledge of the bad,
But even good is versus Christ.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="9">Lord, teach us only Thee to touch,
That with Thy life we filled may be,
And not to touch the good or bad,
Or anything apart from Thee.</stanza>
