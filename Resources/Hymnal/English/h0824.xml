  <lyrics>
	<stanza type="verse" number="1">The Church is Christ's own Body,
  The Father's dwelling-place,
The gathering of the called ones,
  God blended with man's race;
Elect before creation,
  Redeemed by Calv'ry's death,
Her character and standing
  Of heaven, not of earth.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">New man of new creation,
  Born through her risen Lord,
Baptized in God the Spirit,
  Made holy by His Word;
Christ is her life and content,
  Himself her glorious Head;
She has ascended with Him
  O'er all her foes to tread.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">Christ is her one foundation,
  None other man may lay;
All that she has, as Christ, is
  Divine in every way;
Her members through the Spirit
  Their death on Calv'ry own;
They're built in resurrection&amp;mdash;
  Gold, silver, precious stone.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">One God, one Lord, one Spirit&amp;mdash;
  Her elements all one&amp;mdash;
One faith, one hope, one baptism,
  One Body in the Son;
The triune God is in her,
  One Body members own,
By faith they are united,
  In hope of glory shown.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">From every tribe and nation
  Do all the members come,
Regardless of their classes
  United to be one.
No high there is, nor lowly,
  No Jew, nor Gentile clan,
No free, nor slave, nor master,
  But Christ, the "one new man."</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">One Body universal,
  One in each place expressed;
Locality of dwelling
  Her only ground possessed;
Administration local,
  Each answ'ring to the Lord;
Communion universal,
  Upheld in one accord.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">Her local gatherings model
  The New Jerusalem;
Its aspects and its details
  Must show in all of them.
Christ is the Lamp that shineth,
  With God within, the Light;
They are the lampstands bearing
  His glorious Image bright.</stanza>
