    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Christ is our manna true,
Our bread of life indeed;
He's our supply of nourishment,
As on Him now we feed.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">From Egypt Israel fled
Into a desert land;
Egyptian food they left behind,
And wandering began.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">One day, the manna fell,
Oh, what a wondrous feat;
This was the bread the Lord had giv'n
For Israel to eat.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Unique this manna is,
It comes with morning dew;
The visit of God's grace it is,
Forever fresh and new.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">God is majestic, high,
And greater than us all;
But that we may partake of Him,
In Christ, He's fine and small.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Though ground, or beat, or baked,
He's so available;
As bread and cakes and wafers fresh,
We eat Him to the full.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Manna shows Him to be
The germ of life, the seed;
'Tis God Himself sown into us,
The source of all we need.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">Between the morning dew
And cold of winter snow,
This manna too is frost which kills
Things negative below.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="9">How pure and white and clean;
In type our Christ we see;
As we digest His element,
He washes inwardly.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="10">Manna with honey is;
Two lives this type does show;
One for the Lord's redemptive work,
And one His life to grow.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="11">By eating more of Christ
We'll be the less opaque;
We'll then appear as bdellium,
Transparent us to make.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="12">Lord, as we're eating here
And in the manna see
The riches of this glorious Christ,
We're filled with praise to Thee.</stanza>
