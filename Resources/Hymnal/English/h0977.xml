    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Glorious things of thee are spoken,
  Holy city of our God;
He whose word cannot be broken
  Formed thee for His own abode;
On the Rock of Ages founded,
  What can shake thy sure repose?
With salvation's walls surrounded,
  Thou may'st smile at all thy foes.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">See the streams of living waters,
  Springing from eternal love,
Well supply thy blessed members,
  And all fear of want remove;
Who can faint, when such a river
  Ever flows their thirst t' assuage?
Grace which, like the Lord, the giver,
  Never fails from age to age.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Blest constituents of Zion,
  Washed in the Redeemer's blood;
Jesus, whom their souls rely on,
  Makes them kings and priests to God.
'Tis His love His people raises
  Over self to reign as kings:
And as priests, His worthy praises,
  Each his thankful offering brings.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Savior, if of Zion's city
  I, through grace, a member am,
Let the world deride or pity&amp;mdash;
  I will glory in Thy name.
Fading is the worldling's pleasure,
  All his boasted pomp and show;
Solid joys and lasting treasure
  None but Zion's members know.</stanza>
