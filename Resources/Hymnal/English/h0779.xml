	<stanza type="verse" number="1">Pray with one accord in spirit,
  Not according to our thought,
But alone by the anointing,
  As the Lord has ever sought.</stanza>
	<stanza type="chorus" number="">Pray with one accord in spirit,
  Not according to our thought,
But alone by the anointing,
    As the Lord has ever sought.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">Pray with one accord in spirit,
  By the cross deny the soul;
All desires and all intentions
  Let the Spirit now control.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">Pray with one accord in spirit,
  Pray as in the heavenlies;
All the earthly interests treading,
  Fight the principalities.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">Pray with one accord in spirit,
  Supplicate relatedly;
Seek the Lord, His mind, His leading,
  In the Spirit's harmony.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">Pray with one accord in spirit,
  Pray and watch persistently;
For God's kingdom and His glory,
  Pray and watch in harmony.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">Pray with one accord in spirit
  Seeking God in unity;
In the Spirit of the Body
  Ever pray in harmony.</stanza>
