Now we come to eat in one accord
As the church which He has made His own.</stanza>

Stand in oneness on the local ground,
  Eat and drink in oneness there!</stanza>

We're the church His precious blood has bought.
We're redeemed to be in one accord&amp;mdash;
This the goal for which He long has sought.</stanza>

As a loaf in each locality.</stanza>

Not just word, but life in one accord
Testify what God in us hath done.</stanza>

We are one in Him fore'er.
Stand in oneness on the local ground,
