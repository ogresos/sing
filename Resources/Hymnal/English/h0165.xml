  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">My song shall be of Jesus;
  His mercy crowns my days,
He fills my cup with blessings,
  And tunes my heart to praise.
My song shall be of Jesus,
  The precious Lamb of God,
Who gave Himself my ransom,
  And bought me with His blood.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">My song shall be of Jesus
  When, sitting at His feet,
I call to mind His goodness
  In meditation sweet:
My song shall be of Jesus,
  Whatever ill betide;
I'll sing the grace that saves me,
  And keeps me at His side.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">My song shall be of Jesus
  While pressing on my way
To reach the blissful kingdom
  Of pure and perfect day:
And when my soul shall enter
  That realm of splendor fair,
A song of praise to Jesus
  I'll sing forever there.</stanza>
