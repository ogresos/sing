	<stanza type="verse" number="1">As we're sharing of the cup,
  How can we restrain our praise;
For the blood Thou shedd'st for us,
  Worth of which none can appraise.
O how precious is Thy blood!
  All our problems it resolves;
In Thine efficacious blood
  All our care and fear dissolves.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">It is by this blood of worth
  The new testament was made;
For this better covenant,
  'Tis a sure foundation laid.
We have been redeemed by God,
  Not with silver or with gold,
But, Lord, with Thy precious blood,
  Which Thy love doth e'er unfold.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">For remission of our sins
  Thou hast shed Thy cleansing blood.
Which for us has fully met
  All the righteous claims of God.
Thou hast washed us from our sins
  In Thy pow'rful purging blood;
And our conscience purged by it,
  Thus to serve the living God.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">By Thy separating blood,
  We have all been sanctified;
'Tis by Thy preserving blood
  Holiness is testified.
By Thy propitiating blood,
  We have all been justified;
'Tis by Thy redeeming blood
  God is fully satisfied.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">Thru Thy blood shed on the cross,
  We are reconciled to God,
That the way to contact Him
  May in peace by us be trod.
By partaking of Thy blood,
  We have Thine eternal life;
In Thy blood and life received,
  We have rest, free from all strife.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">Now, in heav'n Thy sprinkled blood
  Speaks for us of better things;
Under its defending pow'r
  We are kept from Satan's stings.
By Thine overcoming blood,
  We defeat the enemy;
Over our accuser thus,
  We will have the victory.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">Of Thy blood, for fellowship,
  We commune with all Thy saints;
Under its full covering,
  Our freed spirit never faints.
How can we exhaust, in words,
  The account of Thy dear blood;
We will need eternity
  To declare its boundless good.</stanza>
