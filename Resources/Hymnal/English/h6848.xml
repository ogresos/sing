    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Hear my song, wondrous love:
Jesus came from above,
On the cross crucified,
He released to us God's life divine;
Oh what joy! We're forgiv'n!
No more thirst&amp;mdash;Christ came in!
In my heart, joined for aye,
He flows forth, a river from me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Christ the Lord is not far,
In your mouth, in your heart;
Simply call Jesus' name,
Into you He comes without delay;
Tasting such boundless love,
I can say, O! how deep!
Whoso wills, all may come,
From salvation's streams freely drink.</stanza>
