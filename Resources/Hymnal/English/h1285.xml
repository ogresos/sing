    <stanza type="verse" number="1">The faith which once for all was giv'n
Unto the saints of old,
Has been committed unto us
To guard, defend, and hold.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">And we know whom we have believed
And are persuaded that He is able
To guard, through the Holy Spirit,
  Our deposit to that day.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">This good deposit is the mark
Of God's economy,
Without it we will miss the aim
Of His recovery.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">The myst'ry of the common faith,
A conscience pure requires;
A holy, separated life
For us the Lord desires.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">This outline of the healthy words,
In faith and love we'll hold;
All different teaching, fruitless talk,
Reject with spirit bold.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Oh, healthful teaching, wholesome words:
The truth of godliness!
Oh, good deposit, common faith,
And life of holiness!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Lord, make us now those faithful men
Who pass on what we've heard;
Make us examples of the saints
In spirit, faith, and word.</stanza>
