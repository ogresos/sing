    <stanza type="verse" number="1">His promises indelible,
  His words are firmly fixed.
Faith has no need of witnesses,
  From word to deed is fixed.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Heav'n and earth will be set afire,
High mountains and hills will expire;
Souls in faith in Him retire
  Knowing His word is sure.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Oh, with a heart like Abraham's
  Look up into the sky
And count the stars, not problems brief;
  Faith firm will testify.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">There's dark clouds thick and threatening,
  But just above, it's bright;
By waiting just a few more hours,
  The morning brings pure light.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">In face of persecution calm,
  E'en in the furnace flame;
Our work together with the Son
  Will cause the devil's shame.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Our friends may even forsake us,
  So we approach God's face;
Jesus Himself our power is,
  Provider of our grace.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">In everything His power trust
  Until the rapture own.
The things that we believe in will
  One day be fully shown.</stanza>
