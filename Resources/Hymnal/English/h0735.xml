	<stanza type="verse" number="1">The law of letters God defines,
It is His testimony true;
It shows how loving, holy, just,
Is God, with whom we have to do.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">According to His nature shown
God's law requires that we must live,
That He our souls may justify
And unto us His blessing give.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">The law can never give us life,
Nor any strength to us supply,
But doth its full demands exact
And all our weakness show thereby.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">It was not for God's final plan,
But for man's sin was introduced,
That man by breaking it might know
Himself, his sin to him adduced.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">'Tis by the law all mouths are stopped
And all are shut up under sin;
It brings us to the Christ of God
That God may bless us all in Him.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">The law is but a type of Christ,
Who God's full testimony is,
Who fully has expressed His love,
His holiness and righteousness.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">'Tis Christ, God's testimony real,
Who doth with life divine supply,
That with the law's demands we may
Be more than able to comply.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="8">God's living testimony, He;
By whom God's potent life we share;
Thru Him we're dead unto the law,
And in His Spirit fruit we bear.</stanza>
