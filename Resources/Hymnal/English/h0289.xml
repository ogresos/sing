  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">I stand all amazed at the love Jesus offers me,
Confused at the grace that so fully He proffers me;
I tremble to know that for me He was crucified,
That for me, a sinner, He suffered, He bled and died.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">O it is wonderful that He should care for me
  Enough to die for me!
  O it is wonderful, wonderful to me!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">I marvel that He would descend from His throne divine
To rescue a soul so rebellious and proud as mine;
That He should extend His great love unto such as I,
Sufficient to own, to redeem, and to justify.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">I think of His side, pierced and bleeding to pay the debt,
Such mercy, such love and devotion can I forget?
No, no! I will praise and adore at the mercy seat,
And testify all my desires He doth fully meet.</stanza>
