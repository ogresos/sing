	<stanza type="verse" number="1">Lord, when the Father ne'er was known,
The Father came through Thee below,
That we who lived in ignorance
Might through Thyself the Father know.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">But, Lord, when Thou wast here on earth,
How scarce were those Thyself who knew;
A veil there was 'twixt Thee and them;
They crowded 'round, but saw not through.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">Now as the Spirit Thou hast come
E'en as the Father came in Thee;
As we through Thee the Father know,
Now through the Spirit we know Thee.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">Not with the flesh Thou now art clothed&amp;mdash;
Then must Thou walk with toil around;
But as the Spirit in our heart
Thou dost supply Thyself unbound.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">Thou, Lord, the Father once wast called,
But now the Holy Spirit art;
The Spirit is Thine other form,
Thyself to dwell within our heart.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">By knowing Thee as Spirit, Lord,
We realize Thy life's outflow,
Thy glory and Thy character,
And all Thy being's wonders know.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">Praise to Thy Name now floods our heart;
There is no one as dear as Thee;
For since we know how real Thou art,
No other one could lovelier be.</stanza>
