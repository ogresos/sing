  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">The priest's position holy is;
He sacrifices e'er to God,
Beholds His beauty, incense burns
  Of prayer before the Lord.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Let us the incense burn
Of prayer before the Lord;
The lamp we'd light, through day and night
  Our praise to Him outpoured.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">No natural light, but just the lamp
Within the holy place gives sight;
Whene'er the priest the incense burns,
  The lamp he too must light.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">The grace of God let us extol
And stir our heart sweet praise to sing;
For priests not only light the lamp,
  But constant praises bring.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">I'll offer prayers as incense burns,
Christ's resurrection bring therein,
God's wish thus meet, His heart give joy,
  And I'll rejoice with Him.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">I'll read His Word, His light receive,
E'en as the lamp before Him lit,
His holy light illum'ning me
  To others I'll transmit.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Unto the Lord His praise I'll sing
As holy priests their songs did raise;
O may my heart be filled with Him
  His love and grace to praise.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">I'll offer Christ to God in prayer,
I'll read the Word, His light to know,
For all His grace I'll sing His praise,
  The Spirit then may flow.</stanza>
