    <stanza type="verse" number="1">God made man a vessel he
With a spirit, soul, body.
God to man his content be
That through man His glory see.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Man does have God's image true,
Noble in his status, too.
But God's life man also needs
Divine nature to receive.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Christ in death as God expressed
Man redeemed, His blood was shedd'st.
In His resurrection He
Enters us our life to be.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Man without Christ will perceive
That all things are vanity.
Human life is meaningless
Without hope or purpose.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">But when man takes Christ as life,
He's in spirit born anew.
When he daily lives by Christ,
Vanity is turned to song.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Therefore, man can God express
That the whole world he would bless.
Living water flowing out
People's thirst to satisfy.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">When in glory Christ returns
Glorified our body be
To His glorious body conformed
With Him for eternity.</stanza>
