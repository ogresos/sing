  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Art thou hung'ring for the fulness
  Of the blessing Christ doth give?
Longing now to learn the secret
  Of the life He bids thee live?
In His word thine answer standeth,
  "Christ who is our Life" it saith;
Open now thy heart, and trust Him,
  There to dwell, henceforth, by faith.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Christ, the Lord's Anointed, reigning
  O'er the life He died to win,
Daily shall reveal more fully
  His great power, without, within.
What thou never could'st accomplish
  Shall His Spirit work through thee,
While thy soul this witness beareth,
  'Tis not I, but Christ in me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">In Him dwelleth all God's fulness,
  In Him thou art made complete;
Rise, and claim thy heavenly birthright,
  Kneeling at thy Father's feet.
He will never disappoint thee,
  Praise Him that the gift is thine;
Then go forth to live each moment
  On sufficiency divine.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Lord, I come, and simply resting
  On Thy faithful, changeless word,
I believe the blood doth cleanse me,
  And that Christ is crowned Lord.
Grant henceforth a ceaseless outflow
  Of Thy life and love through me;
Reaching those who sit in darkness,
  Winning priceless souls to Thee.</stanza>
