    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Pray to labor with the Lord,
Pray to pave the way for Him;
Pray to move Him and be moved
From the center to the rim.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Pray to labor with the Lord,
Be identified with Him
In His purpose and His aim
Till His blessing floodeth in.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Pray to labor with the Lord;
Self-ambition and self-will
We must ever cast away,
All His purpose to fulfill.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Pray to labor with the Lord;
Let the Lord initiate
All the plan and all the work;
Then thru us He'll operate.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Pray to labor with the Lord
Till the wheel begins to move;
Pray together with the Lord
Till the Church His pow'r shall prove.</stanza>
