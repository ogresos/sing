    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Once I had a fervent heart,
  And growth in Christ did seek.
Sadly now I love the world;
  My walk with Him is weak.
Day and night I was refreshed,
  In testimony bold,
Minding not the sufferings,
  But now my heart is cold.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">How was I distracted&amp;mdash;
The Father to ignore?
In deep grief He acted,
How can my heart ignore?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Once I yielded all my heart.
  Not serving for reward;
But the world has used me now;
  I'm with the worldly hoard.
Once I worshipped, now I roam,
  Indulging to amuse;
Wasting days, repenting not;
  I precious grace refuse.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Once my heart loved only Him,
  And time with Him would keep;
Ardently I thought of Him
  In waking and asleep.
Worldly favor then I shunned,
  The things did disregard;
Now those worldly things I seek,
  By earth I now am marred.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">At His throne I knelt each day,
  And glory filled my heart;
Union to His will I vowed,
  Nor wanted to depart.
Happily my choice I'd lose,
  None else but His to seek.
But much time has passed since then;
  My zeal for God is weak.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Lab'ring vainly 'neath the sun
  Like shadow and like wind,
Far from His directed flock,
  To vanity did tend.
Things of earth will soon be gone;
  Why let them rule my soul?
Once I watched for His return;
  Why take the wav'ring role?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Soon the Morning Star appears;
  All life on earth grows short.
This foul place I then must leave,
  Unto His arms resort.
Satan and his world reject,
  Taste new grace once again,
Now regain my long lost love,
  Refuse my shameful stain.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">To His path returning,
All the world ignoring,
Glory soon appearing
I'd suffer willingly.</stanza>
