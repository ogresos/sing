    <stanza type="verse" number="1">It was alone the Savior prayed
  In dark Gethsemane;
Alone He drained the bitter cup
  And suffered there for me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Alone, alone,
He bore it all alone;
He gave Himself to save His own,
  He suffered, bled and died alone, alone.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">It was alone the Savior stood
  In Pilate's judgment hall;
Alone the crown of thorns He wore,
  Forsaken thus by all.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Alone upon the cross He hung
  That others He might save;
Forsaken then by God and man.
  Alone, His life He gave.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Can you reject such matchless love?
  Can you His claim disown?
Come, give your all in gratitude,
  Nor leave Him thus alone.</stanza>
