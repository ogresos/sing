    <stanza type="verse" number="1">How I love Thee, precious Jesus,
  That Thy love laid hold of me;
Thou hast drawn and wooed and kissed me
  That a lover I may be!</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Our Beloved, how we love Him,
  So attractive, our delight.
We are captivated wholly
    And are comely in His sight.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">As a company of horses,
  Thou, O Lord, has likened me,
Strong and swift, with Pharaoh's chariots,
  Full of natural energy.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Just a lover with the dove's eyes
  Fixed on Him and Him alone;
Changed are all my natural concepts,
  Oh, the Lord in me has grown!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Now a lily of the valley,
  Standing out among the thorns,
In the Lord alone I'm trusting,
  Of my self-strength I've been shorn.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Make us doves that hide in Thee, Lord;
  Bring us to the secret place.
There You find our voices sweet, Lord,
  And desire to see our face.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Make us then, Lord, smoking pillars,
  Coming from the wilderness.
By Thy death and resurrection
  All our natural will suppress.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">You desire a couch to rest on&amp;mdash;
  We become a rest to Thee;
Thou the Person in our being,
  Gone our personality.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">Now a palanquin You're making&amp;mdash;
  Nothing natural You'll allow.
For Your move and Your expression
  Start this work within us now!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="9">You supply the wood and pillars
  For the structure and support,
Bottom gold and seat of purple
  For our King of royal court.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="10">Only this, O Lord, we offer
  For Thy palanquin so fine:

Just our love, so pure and fitted,
  The interior design.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="11">What a sight when our Beloved
  Wears a crown upon His brow;
Christ, the Church, are now united&amp;mdash;
  Boast and glory to Him now!</stanza>
