    <stanza type="verse" number="1">I remember when my burdens rolled away;
I had carried them for years, night and day.
When I sought the blessed Lord,
And I took Him at His word,
Then at once all my burdens rolled away.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Rolled away, rolled away,
I am happy since my burdens rolled away.
Rolled away, rolled away,
I am happy since my burdens rolled away.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">I remember when my burdens rolled away;
That I feared would never leave, night or day.
Jesus showed to me the loss,
So I left them at the cross;
I was glad when my burdens rolled away.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">I remember when my burdens rolled away,
That had hindered me for years, night and day.
As I sought the throne of grace,
Just a glimpse of Jesus' face,
And I knew that my burdens could not stay.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">I am singing since my burdens rolled away;
There's a song within my heart night and day.
I am living for my King,
And with joy I shout and sing:
"Hallelujah, all my burdens rolled away!"</stanza>
