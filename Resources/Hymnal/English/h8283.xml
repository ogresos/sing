    <stanza type="verse" number="1">North Wind, arise, awaken!
South Wind, come blow on me!
Blow on my heart's green garden;
Fill it with fragrance sweet.
North Wind, arise, awaken!
South Wind, come blow on me!
Blow on my heart's green garden;
Fill it with fragrance sweet.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Would that my well-beloved would come!
Be with me ever, tasting of my love!
Would that my well-beloved would come!
Be with me ever, tasting of my love!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Pour on His head my spikenard,
Rub with my hair His feet;
As on His throne He's sitting,
Make all His house smell sweet.
(repeat)</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">He is of trees the Apple;
I in His shade delight.
Ripe is His fruit and sweet, which
Strengthens and cheers my heart.
(repeat)</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Thou Whom I love, come hither&amp;mdash;
I'm Thine, and Thou art mine&amp;mdash;
Into the fields let's go forth,
Tasting their fruits so fine.
(repeat)</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Lord, as a seal, do set me
Firmly upon Thine heart.
Stronger than death His love is;
Which floods cannot drown out.
(repeat)</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Whom do I have in heaven?&amp;mdash;
None can compare with Thee.
None on the earth I'd treasure&amp;mdash;
No one, dear Lord, but Thee.
(repeat)</stanza>
