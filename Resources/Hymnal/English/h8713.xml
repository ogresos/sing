    <stanza type="verse" number="1">O, little lamb who has lost your way,
Jesus is seeking for you today.
One from the hundred has gone astray.
O, could it be you?</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">O, could it be you?
O, could it be you?
One from the hundred has gone astray.
O, could it be you?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Are you a man who has lost his way?
The Spirit's seeking for you today.
From ten gold coins one has rolled away.
O, could it be you?</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">O, could it be you?
O, could it be you?
From ten gold coins one has rolled away.
O, could it be you?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">O, wand'ring soul, is there peace within?
How we'd rejoice if you'd but return!
For His lost son does the Father yearn.
O, could it be you?</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">O, could it be you?
O, could it be you?
For His lost son does the Father yearn.
O, could it be you?</stanza>
