	<stanza type="verse" number="1">Lord, teach us how to pray,
Not as the nations do in vain,
But turn us from our way,
And cause us, Lord, to call on You each day&amp;mdash;
  Lord Jesus, grow in us.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">Lord, You're the seed of life;
You've sown Yourself into our heart,
And now You have a start;
So day by day more life to us impart&amp;mdash;
  Lord Jesus, grow in us.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">Lord Jesus, soften us;
You know the source from which we came.
By calling on Your name,
Lord, let no earth unturned nor rocks remain&amp;mdash;
  Lord Jesus, grow in us.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">Lord, how Your light makes clear
That we could not but e'er fail You;
Yet there's a message true,
The seed of life within us will break through&amp;mdash;
  Lord Jesus, grow in us.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">Make us in spirit poor;
Lord, take whate'er we think we know.
We'll open to life's flow,
And thus take in the life that makes us grow&amp;mdash;
  Lord Jesus, grow in us.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">Lord, make us pure in heart;
For we'll be not content until
You all our being fill,
O Lord, renew our mind, emotion, will&amp;mdash;
  Lord Jesus, grow in us.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">Yes, Lord, impress our heart
That we must take You in each day;
The seed will have its way;
Your growing brings the kingdom here to stay&amp;mdash;
  Lord Jesus, grow in us.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="8">Amen!&amp;mdash;The growth in life!
There's nothing that Your life can't do;
Our every part renew.
We'll make it, we'll make it just by You.
  Lord Jesus, grow in us.</stanza>
	<stanza type="chorus" number="">Lord Jesus, grow in us.</stanza>
