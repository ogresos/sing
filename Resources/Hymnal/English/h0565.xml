  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Under His wings I am safely abiding;
  Though the night deepens and tempests are wild,
Still I can trust Him, I know He will keep me;
  He has redeemed me, and I am His child.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Under His wings, under His wings,
  Who from His love can sever?
Under His wings my soul shall abide,
    Safely abide forever.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Under His wings&amp;mdash;what a refuge in sorrow!
  How the heart yearningly turns to His rest!
Often when earth has no balm for my healing,
  There I find comfort, and there I am blest.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Under His wings&amp;mdash;oh, what precious enjoyment!
  There will I hide till life's trials are o'er;
Sheltered, protected, no evil can harm me;
  Resting in Jesus I'm safe evermore.</stanza>
