    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Unto the hills around do I lift up
  My longing eyes;
O whence for me shall my salvation come,
  From whence arise?
From God the Lord doth come my certain aid,
From God the Lord, who heav'n and earth hath made.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">He will not suffer that thy foot be moved:
  Safe shalt thou be.
No careless slumber shall His eyelids close,
  Who keepeth thee.
Behold, He sleepeth not, He slumbereth ne'er,
Who keepeth Israel in His holy care.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Jehovah is Himself thy keeper true,
  Thy changeless shade;
Jehovah thy defense on thy right hand
  Himself hath made.
And thee no sun by day shall ever smite;
No moon shall harm thee in the silent night.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">From every evil shall He keep thy soul,
  From every sin;
Jehovah shall preserve thy going out,
  Thy coming in.
Above thee, watching, He whom we adore
Shall keep thee henceforth, yea, for evermore.</stanza>
