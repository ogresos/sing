  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">How much can we do for our Savior?
  How much for our dear fellow man?
The way to do more than we're able
Is Jesus within to enable;
  Thus we can do more than we can.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">How much can we be for our Savior
  In life with its brief, fleeting span?
If Jesus within us is dwelling
Our life and our actions infilling,
  We all can do more than we can.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">How much can we bear for our Savior?
  How much for our dear fellow man?
If in us His love is constraining,
If 'neath us His arms are sustaining,
  We all can do more than we can.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">How much can we give for our Savior?
  To succor our dear fellow man?
If from us His love is o'erflowing,
Our life will be ever outgoing;
  We'll always do more than we can.</stanza>
