    <stanza type="verse" number="1">God laid my sins on Jesus, 
His spotless, holy Lamb;
Instead of me, God cursed Him,
Now full released I am.
Upon His faultless Lamb, God
Was pleased my faults to lay,
That He for me should suffer,
My debt of sin to pay.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">My sickness laid on Jesus,
The lash for me endured;
My weaknesses He carried
That I be fully cured.
My misery on Jesus,
He bore it all for me;
My sorrow He abolished
And gave me joy and peace.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">I now have rest in Jesus,
My King of Righteousness;
His death met God's demand, and
His blood my conscience cleansed.
Now all my trust's in Jesus,
My strength for ev'ry hour;
His living shows God's riches,
His life in me empow'rs.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">I give my heart to Jesus,
That there He'd be enthroned
To be my Lord and life, and
In me to make His home.
According to His pattern
I hope to live each day;
His attitude and actions
May He through me display!</stanza>
