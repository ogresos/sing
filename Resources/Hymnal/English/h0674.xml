  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">The Lord will silently plan for thee,
Thou object of omniscient care;
God undertakes Himself to be
Thy Pilot through each subtle snare.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">The Lord will silently plan for thee,
So certainly, He cannot fail!
Rest on the faithfulness of God,
In Him thou surely shalt prevail.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">The Lord will silently plan for thee
Some wonderful surprise of love.
Eye hath not seen, nor ear hath heard,
But it is kept for thee to prove.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">The Lord will silently plan for thee,
His purpose He'll to thee unfold;
The tangled skein shall shine at last,
A masterpiece of skill untold.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">The Lord will silently plan for thee,
A happy child kept in His care
As though no other claimed His love,
But thou alone to Him wert dear.</stanza>
