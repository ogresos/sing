	<stanza type="verse" number="1">God's intention is to have us
  All conformed to His dear Son;
Thus a work of transformation
  By the Spirit must be done.</stanza>
	<stanza type="chorus" number="">Lord, transform us to Thine image
  In emotion, mind, and will;
Saturate us with Thy Spirit,
    All our being wholly fill.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">God hath us regenerated
  In our spirit with His life;
But He must transform us further&amp;mdash;
  In our soul by His own life.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">Spreading outward from our spirit
  Doth the Lord transform our soul,
By the inward parts renewing,
  Till within His full control.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">By the power of His Spirit
  In His pattern He transforms;
From His glory to His glory
  To His image He conforms.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">He transforms, all sanctifying,
  Till like Him we are matured;
He transforms, our soul possessing,
  Till His stature is secured.</stanza>
