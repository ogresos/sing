  <lyrics>
	<stanza type="verse" number="1">The Church the vessel is to Christ,
Him to contain and Him express,
Just as the human body doth
Man's life show forth, his life possess.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="2">As was the temple to the ark,
Receptacle and resting-place;
So Christ the Church's content is,
And in the Church, Christ's dwelling-place.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="3">As Christ is God's true mystery,
God to explain and God express;
So is the Church Christ's mystery,
Christ to explain and manifest.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="4">The members of the Church of Christ
Are all primarily of clay;
They need to be transformed and made
Transparent, precious day by day.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="5">By transformation they are built,
A vessel they to Christ afford;
His all-inclusiveness they hold;
Transparent, they express the Lord.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="6">Thru all the transformation work
The triune God performs in them,
The Church a corporate vessel is
And like the new Jerusalem.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="7">How precious she in each respect,
Transparent too in every phase;
Christ with God's fulness she contains,
Christ with God's glory she displays.</stanza>
	<stanza type="verse" number="8">With Christ as life, with God as light,
And with the Spirit's living flow,
The triune God she manifests
For all the universe to know.</stanza>
