    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Behold! behold the Lamb of God,
  On the cross! On the cross!
For us He shed His precious blood,
  On the cross! On the cross!
O hear His all-important cry,
  "Eli, lama sabachthani?"
Draw near and see the Savior die,
  On the cross! On the cross!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Behold His arms extended wide,
  On the cross! On the cross!
Behold His bleeding hands and side,
  On the cross! On the cross!
The sun withholds its rays of light,
  The heav'ns are clothed in shades of night,
While Jesus wins the glorious fight,
  On the cross! On the cross!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">By faith we see Him lifted up,
  On the cross! On the cross!
He drinks for us the bitter cup,
  On the cross! On the cross!
The rocks do rend, the mountains quake,
  While Jesus all our sins doth take,
While Jesus suffers for our sake,
  On the cross! On the cross!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">And now the mighty deed is done,
  On the cross! On the cross!
The battle fought, the vict'ry won,
  On the cross! On the cross!
To heav'n He turns triumphant eyes;
  " 'Tis finished" now, the Conqu'ror cries,
Then bows His sacred head and dies,
  On the cross! On the cross!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">But now He's ris'n, ascended, crowned,
  On the throne! On the throne!
Heav'n's highest place for Him is found,
  On the throne! On the throne!
Our hearts we low in worship bow,
  And join, as one, to hail Him now:
"Worthy, O Lamb of God, art Thou!"
  On the throne! On the throne!</stanza>
