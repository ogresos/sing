  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Hark what a sound, and too divine for hearing,
  Stirs on the earth and trembles in the air;
Is it the thunder of the Lord's appearing?
  Is it the music of His people's prayer?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Surely He cometh, and a thousand voices
  Shout to the saints, and to the deaf and dumb;
Surely He cometh, and the earth rejoices,
  Glad in His coming who hath sworn: I come!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">This hath He done, and shall we not adore Him?
  This shall He do, and can we still despair?
Come, let us quickly fling ourselves before Him, .
  Cast at His feet the burden of our care.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Thru life and death, thru sorrow and thru sinning
  He shall suffice me, for He hath sufficed:
Christ is the end, for Christ was the beginning,
  Christ the beginning, for the end is Christ.</stanza>
