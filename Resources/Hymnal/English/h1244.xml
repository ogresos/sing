    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Behold how good a thing
It is to dwell in peace;
How pleasing to our King,
This fruit of righteousness;
When brethren all in one agree,
They know the joy of unity!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">When all are sweetly joined
(True followers of the Lamb),
They're one in heart and mind,
They think and speak the same;
When all in love together dwell;
The comfort is unspeakable!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Where unity takes place,
The joys of heav'n we prove;
This is the gospel grace,
The unction from above;
The Spirit on all saints is shed,
Descending swift from Christ the Head.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Where unity is found,
The sweet anointing grace
Extends to all around,
And shines from every face;
To every praising saint it comes,
And fills him with divine perfumes.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">On all His chosen ones
The precious oil comes down:
Anointing as it runs,
Anointing on and on.
E'en to His skirts (the meanest name
That longs to love the bleeding Lamb).</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">From Aaron's beard it rolls,
(Those nearest to His face),
The humble, trembling souls
Who know abundant grace;
The grace, the grace for all is free,
For, lo, it reaches now to me!</stanza>
    <stanza type="note" number="">(Repeat the last line of each stanza)</stanza>
