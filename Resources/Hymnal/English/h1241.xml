    <stanza type="verse" number="1">God's life and building can be seen
  Within the Song of Songs;
He shows by types His seeking ones,
  The Bride for whom Christ longs!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">She, as a team of horses shows
  A love, so swift and strong!
But this is love that's natural&amp;mdash;
  It pulls the world along!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">As time goes by, her concepts change,
  With dove's eyes she can see
That naught can with her love compare&amp;mdash;
  There's none so dear as He!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">A lily she is now to Him
  (For still the Lord draws on),
Her faith is not in earthly toil,
  But in the wondrous Son.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">She's next a dove who hides herself
  Within the cloven rock;
Now in her Lord's ascended life
  Is love which knows no shock!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Of smoke, a pillar she's become,
  And now, as wand'ring ends,
Her wills to His will are subdued,
  What fragrance sweet ascends!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Behold His couch . . . (O, can this be?)
  E'en midst the fearsome night . . .
She now affords her Lord such rest,
  The foe is put to flight!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">A vessel to contain the King!
  (This type is full of worth.)
A palanquin He's made Himself
  For His move on the earth!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="9">Of wood this vessel is composed:
  Christ's ris'n humanity.
Its silver pillars for support
  And floor of gold we see!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="10">The seat of purple signifies
  Christ is of kings the King.
To Him, as fittings for within,
  Their love His dear ones bring!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="11">The day will come&amp;mdash;('tis surely soon)
  And glad will be Thy heart&amp;mdash;
What boast and glory to Thyself;
  Thy crown, Thy counterpart!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="12">A garden fair, enclosed is she
  With spices, fragrant, sweet.
She now brings forth materials
  The building to complete!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="13">A city pleasant, comely, too;
  No greater building, this!
So beautiful, yet to the foe
  A conq'ring army 'tis!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="14">As we eat Jesus, praise the Lord,
  The transformation's done,
Until at last, the work's complete&amp;mdash;
  Christ and His Bride are one!</stanza>
