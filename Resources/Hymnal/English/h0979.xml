    <stanza type="verse" number="1">How glorious, how bright it shines,
The holy, new Jerusalem;
It is God's dwelling place with man,
The spotless bride of Christ, the Lamb.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Saints of the Old and of the New,
Heirs of the promise God bestowed,
Components of the city are,
Together built for God's abode.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Perfectly square the city lies,
All sides are equal&amp;mdash;length, width, height;
No measurement more long or short,
No part oblique, it stands upright.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">The city with its street pure gold
As clear as glass transparent is,
Showing that God's transcendent life
Its quality and nature is.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Twelve city gates are each one pearl;
Thus man is through redemption shown
Reborn and as a pearl transformed,
Entering to a realm God's own.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">The twelve foundations of its wall
Are with twelve precious stones adorned;
Through fire and pressure recomposed
And with eternal value formed.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">The wall of jasper, crystal clear,
God's glory by it fully shown;
His glorious light through it does shine,
And He appears as jasper stone.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">The wall a separation makes,
Excluding all that is unclean;
Gold, pearls, and precious stones alone
The holy city has within.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="9">God and the Lamb the Temple are!
We shall behold His glorious face;
His presence never will depart,
We'll worship Him thru endless days.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="10">The city needs no sun nor moon
For God's own glory is its light;
The Lamb's the lamp the city bears,
In all directions blazing bright.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="11">Out from the throne of God and the Lamb
Flows midst the street a living stream,
And on its banks, on either side,
The tree of life is thriving seen.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="12">This signifies the life of God
Not just for food or water flows,
But carries God's authority
As it throughout the city goes.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="13">The street of purest gold therein
God's nature as the way doth show;
A river in it flows for drink
And fruits of life abundant grow.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="14">The number twelve means government,
Perfection which eternal is;
God blent with man it also tells&amp;mdash;
Three multiplied by four shows this.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="15">Darkness and death shall be no more,
Sorrow and pain shall pass away,
Old will be gone and all be new,
God will abide with man for aye.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="16">The city has God's image full,
It rules for Him, the sovereign King,
Fulfilling His eternal plan,
Complete content to Him to bring.</stanza>
