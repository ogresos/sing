    <stanza type="verse" number="1">The saints throughout the centuries
Have praised the Lord that He,
The Lamb of God, has saved us,
From sin has set us free;
Yet scarcely for the Lion
Have we yet sounded praise,
Though oft for our redemption
We've all our voices raised.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">John wept as he considered
That none the right did own
The scroll to take and open,
God's myst'ry to make known;
No, none on earth nor heaven,
Nor universe around&amp;mdash;
And we, too, would be weeping
If none were worthy found.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">The universe, mysterious,
Would be in darkness still,
Could none break through to open
The scroll, to show God's will;
But, lo, the worthy Lion
Of Judah hath prevailed
The seven seals to open,
And have the scroll unveiled.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">No longer now in darkness
God's secret is enclosed,
But to our inner vision
It's open, full, disclosed;
Our hearts are for this purpose,
Our lives are for His plan;
And for this revelation
We praise the Lion-Lamb!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">The four-and-twenty elders
All fall before that sight.
The living creatures praise Him,
Who rest not, day nor night.
So let us join their praises
To Him who loosed God's plan;
We'll lift with theirs our voices
To praise the Lion-Lamb!</stanza>
