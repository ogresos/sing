    <stanza type="verse" number="1">When Christ once died on Calvary,
  I too was there;
'Twas in my place He stood for me,
And now accepted e'en as He,
  His name I bear.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live,
Yet, not I, but Christ who liveth in me;
And the life I live in the flesh,
I live by the faith of the Son of God,
  Who loved, and gave Himself for me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">When Christ once rose with life divine,
  I too was there;
His resurrection pow'r is mine,
And as the branches and the vine
  His life I share.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">When Christ will come some day for me,
  I shall be there;
With Him and like Him I shall be,
And all His glorious majesty
  I too shall share.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">O blessed life so deep, so high,
  Lord, keep me there;
Help me with Christ to live, to die,
And let me with Him, bye and bye
  His glory share.</stanza>
