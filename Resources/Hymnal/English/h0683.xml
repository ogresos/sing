    <stanza type="verse" number="1">God holds the key of all unknown,
    And I am glad;
If other hands should hold the key,
Or if He trusted it to me,
    I might be sad.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">What if tomorrow's cares were here,
    Without its rest?
I'd rather He unlocked the day,
And, as the hours swing open, say,
    My will is best.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">The very dimness of my sight
    Makes me secure;
For, groping in my misty way,
I feel His hand; I hear Him say,
    My help is sure.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">I cannot read His future plans;
    But this I know:
I have the smiling of His face,
And all the refuge of His grace
    While here below.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Enough; this covers all my wants;
    And so I rest;
For what I cannot, He can see,
And in His care I saved shall be,
    Forever blest.</stanza>
