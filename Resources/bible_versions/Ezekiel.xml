11:15|KJV|Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, are they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the LORD: unto us is this land given in possession.

11:16|KJV|Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come.

11:23|KJV|And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city.

11:24|KJV|Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.
11:24|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|靈將我舉起，在異象中藉著神的靈將我帶進迦勒底，到被擄的人那堙C我所見的異象就離我上升去了。

12:2|KJV|Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, which have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not: for they are a rebellious house.
12:2|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|人子阿，你住在悖逆的家中；他們有眼可看，卻看不見，有耳可聽，卻聽不見，因為他們是悖逆之家。
12:3|Darby|And thou, son of man, prepare thee a captive's baggage, and  go captive by day in their sight; and thou shalt go captive  from thy place to another place in their sight. It may be they  will consider, though they are a rebellious house.
12:3|KJV|Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they be a rebellious house.
12:3|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|所以人子阿，你要為自己豫備擄去時用的物件，在白日當他們眼前遷徙而去；要當著他們眼前，從你所在的地方遷到別處去。或者他們可以看明自己是悖逆之家。
12:4|Darby|And bring forth thy baggage by day in their sight, as a  captive's baggage, and thou thyself, go forth at even in their  sight as they that go forth into captivity.
12:4|KJV|Then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing: and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight, as they that go forth into captivity.
12:4|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|你要在白日當他們眼前，把你的物件帶出去，好像帶著擄去時所用的物件；到了晚上，你要在他們眼前出去，像被擄的人出去一樣。
12:5|Darby|Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out  thereby.
12:5|KJV|Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.
12:5|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|你要在他們眼前挖通了牆，從其中將物件帶出去。

12:10|KJV|Say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; This burden concerneth the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel that are among them.
12:10|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|你要對他們說，主耶和華如此說，這默示是關於耶路撒冷的首領，和在耶路撒冷的以色列全家。
12:11|Darby|Say, I am your sign: as I have done, so shall it be done  unto them: they shall go into exile, into captivity.
12:11|KJV|Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done unto them: they shall remove and go into captivity.
12:11|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|你要說，我是你們的豫兆：我怎樣行，他們所遭遇的也必怎樣。他們必被遷徙，被擄去；
12:12|Darby|And the prince that is among them shall bear upon [his]  shoulder in the dark, and shall go forth; they shall dig  through the wall to carry out thereby; he shall cover his face,  that he see not the land with [his] eyes.
12:12|KJV|And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the twilight, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, that he see not the ground with his eyes.
12:12|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|他們中間的首領也必在天黑的時候，將物件搭在肩頭上帶出去；他們要挖通了牆，從其中帶出去；他必蒙住臉，眼看不見地。
12:13|Darby|And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken  in my snare; and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the  Chaldeans; but he shall not see it, and there shall he die.
12:13|KJV|My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare: and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.

12:15|KJV|And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall scatter them among the nations, and disperse them in the countries.

12:16|KJV|But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen whither they come; and they shall know that I am the LORD.

12:19|KJV|And say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord GOD of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and of the land of Israel; They shall eat their bread with carefulness, and drink their water with astonishment, that her land may be desolate from all that is therein, because of the violence of all them that dwell therein.
12:19|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|你要對這地的百姓說，主耶和華向以色列地耶路撒冷的居民如此說，他們喫飯必憂慮，喝水必驚惶；因其中居住的眾人所行強暴的事，他們的地必然荒廢，其中所充滿的必一無所存。
12:20|Darby|And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and  the land shall be a desolation; and ye shall know that I [am]  Jehovah.
12:20|KJV|And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be desolate; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.
12:20|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|有居民的城邑必變為荒場，地也必變為荒廢；你們就知道我是耶和華。
12:21|Darby|And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,

12:22|KJV|Son of man, what is that proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth?
12:22|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|人子阿，關於以色列地，你們怎麼有這俗語，說，日子遲延，一切異象都落空呢？

12:23|KJV|Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the effect of every vision.
12:23|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|因此，你要對他們說，主耶和華如此說，我必使這俗語止息，以色列中不再用這俗語。你卻要對他們說，日子臨近，一切異象的應驗也臨近了。
12:24|Darby|For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering  divination in the midst of the house of Israel.
12:24|KJV|For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.
12:24|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|從此，在以色列家中必不再有任何虛假的異象和奉承的占卜。
12:25|Darby|For I [am] Jehovah; I will speak, and the word that I  shall speak shall be performed, it shall be no more deferred.  For in your days, O rebellious house, will I speak the word and  will perform it, saith the Lord Jehovah.

13:4|Darby|O Israel, thy prophets have been like foxes in desert  places.
13:4|KJV|O Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.
13:4|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|以色列阿，你的申言者好像荒場中的狐狸，
13:5|Darby|Ye have not gone up into the breaches, nor made up the  fence for the house of Israel, to stand in the battle in the  day of Jehovah.
13:5|KJV|Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the LORD.
13:5|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|沒有上去堵擋破口，也沒有為以色列家修造牆垣，使其當耶和華的日子，在爭戰中站立得住。
13:6|Darby|They have seen vanity and lying divination, that say,  Jehovah saith! and Jehovah hath not sent them; and they make  [them] to hope that the word will be fulfilled.
13:6|KJV|They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD saith: and the LORD hath not sent them: and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word.
13:6|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|他們所見的是虛假，是謊詐的占卜；他們說是耶和華說的，其實耶和華並沒有差遣他們，他們卻指望自己的話必要成就。
13:7|Darby|Have ye not seen a vain vision, and spoken a lying  divination, when ye say, Jehovah saith; and I have not spoken?
13:7|KJV|Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, whereas ye say, The LORD saith it; albeit I have not spoken?
13:7|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|你們豈不是見了虛假的異象麼？豈不是說了謊詐的占卜麼？你們說，這是耶和華說的，其實我沒有說。
13:8|Darby|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because ye speak  vanity, and have seen lies, therefore behold, I am against you,  saith the Lord Jehovah.
13:8|KJV|Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have spoken vanity, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, saith the Lord GOD.
13:8|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|所以主耶和華如此說，因你們說的是虛假，見的是謊詐，所以我就與你們反對，這是主耶和華說的。
13:9|Darby|And my hand shall be against the prophets that see vanity  and that divine lies: they shall not be in the council of my  people, neither shall they be written in the register of the  house of Israel, and they shall not enter into the land of  Israel: and ye shall know that I [am] the Lord Jehovah.
13:9|KJV|And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.
13:9|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|我的手必攻擊那見虛假異象、用謊詐占卜的申言者，他們必不得列在我民的會中，不得錄在以色列家的冊上，也不得進入以色列地；你們就知道我是主耶和華。
13:10|Darby|Because, yea because they have seduced my people, saying,  Peace! and there is no peace; and one buildeth up a wall, and  lo, they daub it with untempered [mortar] --
13:10|KJV|Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and there was no peace; and one built up a wall, and, lo, others daubed it with untempered morter:
13:10|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|因為他們使我的民走岔了，說，平安，其實沒有平安；就像有人立起牆壁，他們倒抹上未泡透的灰。
13:11|Darby|say unto them which daub it with untempered [mortar] that  it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing rain, and ye, O  great hailstones, shall fall, and a stormy wind shall burst  forth.
13:11|KJV|Say unto them which daub it with untempered morter, that it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend it.
13:11|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|所以你要對那些抹上未泡透灰的人說，牆要倒塌。必有暴雨漫過；大冰雹阿，你們要降下；暴風也要吹裂這牆。
13:12|Darby|And lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto  you, Where is the daubing with which ye have daubed [it]?
13:12|KJV|Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it?
13:12|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|這牆倒塌之後，人豈不問你們說，你們抹上未泡透的灰在那堜O？
13:13|Darby|Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will cause to  burst forth a stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an  overflowing rain in mine anger, and hail-stones in fury for  utter destruction.
13:13|KJV|Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger, and great hailstones in my fury to consume it.
13:13|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|所以主耶和華如此說，我要在忿怒中使暴風吹裂這牆，在我的怒氣中必有暴雨漫過，並有大冰雹在忿怒中毀滅這牆。
13:14|Darby|And I will break down the wall that ye have daubed with  untempered [mortar], and bring it down to the ground, so that  the foundation thereof shall be discovered; and it shall fall,  and ye shall be destroyed in the midst thereof; and ye shall  know that I [am] Jehovah.
13:14|KJV|So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered morter, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered, and it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

16:9|Darby|And I washed thee with water, and thoroughly washed away  thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil;
16:9|KJV|Then washed I thee with water; yea, I throughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.
16:9|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|那時我用水洗你，洗去你身上的血，又用油抹你。
16:10|Darby|and I clothed thee with embroidered work, and shod thee  with badgers' skin, and I bound thee about with byssus, and  covered thee with silk.
16:10|KJV|I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with badgers' skin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I covered thee with silk.
16:10|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|我也使你身穿刺繡的衣服，腳穿海狗皮的鞋，並用細麻布給你裹頭，用絲綢給你遮身。
16:11|Darby|And I decked thee with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon  thy hands, and a chain on thy neck;
16:11|KJV|I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck.
16:11|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|我用妝飾打扮你，將鐲子戴在你手上，將鍊子戴在你項上；
16:12|Darby|and I put a ring on thy nose, and earrings in thine ears,  and a beautiful crown upon thy head.
16:12|KJV|And I put a jewel on thy forehead, and earrings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thine head.
16:12|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|又將環子戴在你鼻子上，將耳環戴在你耳朵上，將華冠戴在你頭上。
16:13|Darby|Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver, and thy  raiment was byssus, and silk, and embroidered work. Thou didst  eat fine flour, and honey, and oil; and thou becamest  exceedingly beautiful, and thou didst prosper into a kingdom.
16:13|KJV|Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil: and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou didst prosper into a kingdom.
16:13|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|這樣，你就有金銀的妝飾，穿的是細麻衣、絲綢和繡花衣；喫的是細麵、蜂蜜和油。你也極其美麗，發達到王后的尊榮。
16:14|Darby|And thy fame went forth among the nations for thy beauty;  for it was perfect through my magnificence, which I had put  upon thee, saith the Lord Jehovah.
16:14|KJV|And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it was perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord GOD.
16:14|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|你因美麗，名聲傳在列國中；你十分美麗，是因我加在你身上的威榮，這是主耶和華說的。
16:15|Darby|But thou didst confide in thy beauty, and playedst the  harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy whoredoms on  every one that passed by: his it was.
16:15|KJV|But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on every one that passed by; his it was.
16:15|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|只是你仗著自己的美麗，又因你的名聲就行邪淫。你向每個過路的縱情淫亂，你的美麗就歸於他。
16:16|Darby|And of thy garments thou didst take, and madest for  thyself high places decked with divers colours, and didst play  the harlot thereupon: [the like] hath not come to pass, and  shall be no more.
16:16|KJV|And of thy garments thou didst take, and deckedst thy high places with divers colours, and playedst the harlot thereupon: the like things shall not come, neither shall it be so.
16:16|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|你拿些衣服，為自己造色彩繽紛的邱壇，在其上行邪淫；這樣的事從未有過，也不該有。
16:17|Darby|And thou didst take thy fair jewels of my gold and of my  silver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images of  males, and didst commit fornication with them.
16:17|KJV|Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images of men, and didst commit whoredom with them,
16:17|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|你又將我給你的金銀所造華美的物件拿來，為自己製造男像，與那些像行邪淫；
16:18|Darby|And thou tookest thine embroidered garments, and coveredst  them; and thou didst set mine oil and mine incense before them.
16:18|KJV|And tookest thy broidered garments, and coveredst them: and thou hast set mine oil and mine incense before them.
16:18|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|又拿你的繡花衣服給它們披上，並將我的油和香擺在它們跟前；
16:19|Darby|And my bread which I had given thee, the fine flour and  the oil and the honey wherewith I fed thee, thou didst even set  it before them for a sweet savour: thus it was, saith the Lord  Jehovah.
16:19|KJV|My meat also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou hast even set it before them for a sweet savour: and thus it was, saith the Lord GOD.
16:19|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|又將我賜給你的食物，就是我賜給你喫的細麵、油和蜂蜜，都擺在它們面前為怡爽的香氣；事情就這樣發生了，這是主耶和華說的。
16:20|Darby|And thou didst take thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou  hadst borne unto me, and these didst thou sacrifice unto them,  to be devoured. Were thy whoredoms a small matter,
16:20|KJV|Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured. Is this of thy whoredoms a small matter,
16:20|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|你更將你給我所生的兒女獻給那些偶像作食物。你行淫亂豈是小事，
16:21|Darby|that thou didst slay my children and give them up in  passing them over to them?
16:21|KJV|That thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them?
16:21|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|竟將我的兒女殺了，使他們經火獻給那些偶像麼？
16:22|Darby|And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast  not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and  bare, when thou wast weltering in thy blood.
16:22|KJV|And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and wast polluted in thy blood.
16:22|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|你行這一切可憎和淫亂的事，並未追念你幼年赤身露體，在血中掙扎的日子。
16:23|Darby|And it came to pass after all thy wickedness (woe, woe  unto thee! saith the Lord Jehovah),
16:23|KJV|And it came to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto thee! saith the LORD GOD;)
16:23|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|你行這一切惡事之後，（主耶和華說，你有禍了，有禍了！）
16:24|Darby|that thou didst also build unto thee a place of  debauchery, and didst make thee a high place in every street:
16:24|KJV|That thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place, and hast made thee an high place in every street.
16:24|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|又為自己建造圓頂花樓，在各街市為自己作了高臺。
16:25|Darby|thou didst build thy high place at every head of the way,  and madest thy beauty to be abhorred, and thou didst open thy  feet to every one that passed by, and multiply thy whoredom.
16:25|KJV|Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredoms.
16:25|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|你在各街頭建造高臺，使你的美貌變為可憎的，又向一切過路的伸開雙腿，多行淫亂。
16:26|Darby|And thou didst commit fornication with the Egyptians thy  neighbours, great of flesh; and didst multiply thy whoredom to  provoke me to anger.
16:26|KJV|Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours, great of flesh; and hast increased thy whoredoms, to provoke me to anger.
16:26|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|你也和你鄰邦放縱肉體的埃及人行淫，多行淫亂惹我發怒。
16:27|Darby|And behold, I stretched out my hand over thee, and  diminished thine appointed portion; and I gave thee over unto  the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the  Philistines, who were confounded at thy lewd way.
16:27|KJV|Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee, and have diminished thine ordinary food, and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, which are ashamed of thy lewd way.
16:27|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|看哪，我伸手攻擊你，減少你應得的糧食，又將你交給恨你的非利士眾女子，使她們任意待你；她們對你放蕩的行徑感到羞恥。
16:28|Darby|And thou didst commit fornication with the Assyrians,  because thou wast insatiable; yea, thou didst commit  fornication with them, and yet couldest not be satisfied.
16:28|KJV|Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, because thou wast unsatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet couldest not be satisfied.
16:28|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|你因還不滿足，又與亞述人行淫；與他們行淫之後，仍不滿足。
16:29|Darby|And thou didst multiply thy whoredom with the land of  merchants, Chaldea, and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith.
16:29|KJV|Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied therewith.
16:29|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|你又多行淫亂，直到那貿易之地，就是迦勒底，你仍不滿足。
16:30|Darby|How weak is thy heart, saith the Lord Jehovah, seeing thou  doest all these [things], the work of a whorish woman, under no  restraint;
16:30|KJV|How weak is thine heart, saith the LORD GOD, seeing thou doest all these things, the work of an imperious whorish woman;
16:30|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|主耶和華說，你行這一切事，都是不知收歛之妓女所行的，可見你的心是何等懦弱！
16:31|Darby|in that thou buildest thy place of debauchery at the head  of every way, and makest thy high place in every street! And  thou hast not been as a harlot, in that thou scornest reward,
16:31|KJV|In that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way, and makest thine high place in every street; and hast not been as an harlot, in that thou scornest hire;
16:31|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|你在各路口建造圓頂花樓，在各街市作了高臺，你卻輕看酬價，不像妓女。
16:32|Darby|O adulterous wife, that taketh strangers instead of her  husband.
16:32|KJV|But as a wife that committeth adultery, which taketh strangers instead of her husband!
16:32|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|你這行淫的妻子，寧肯接外人，不接自己的丈夫。
16:33|Darby|They give rewards to all harlots; but thou gavest thy  rewards to all thy lovers, and rewardedst them, that they might  come unto thee on every side for thy whoredoms.
16:33|KJV|They give gifts to all whores: but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and hirest them, that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom.
16:33|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|妓女都是得人贈送，你反倒贈送你所愛的人，賄賂他們從四圍來與你行淫。
16:34|Darby|And in thee is the contrary from [other] women, in thy  whoredoms, in that none followeth thee to commit fornication;  and whereas thou givest a reward, and no reward is given unto  thee, so art thou contrary.
16:34|KJV|And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms, whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms: and in that thou givest a reward, and no reward is given unto thee, therefore thou art contrary.
16:34|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|你行淫與別的婦女相反，因為不是人追求要與你行淫；你給人酬價，人並不給你酬價；所以你與別的婦女相反。
16:35|Darby|Therefore, O harlot, hear the word of Jehovah.
16:35|KJV|Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD:
16:35|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|因此，你這妓女阿，要聽耶和華的話：
16:36|Darby|Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thy money hath been  poured out, and thy nakedness discovered through thy  fornications with thy lovers, and with all the idols of thine  abominations, and because of the blood of thy children which  thou didst give unto them;
16:36|KJV|Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers, and with all the idols of thy abominations, and by the blood of thy children, which thou didst give unto them;
16:36|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|主耶和華如此說，因你的情慾傾洩了，露出下體，與你所愛的人行淫，並與你一切可憎的偶像行淫，又因你把兒女獻給偶像，流他們的血，
16:37|Darby|therefore, behold, I will gather all thy lovers with whom  thou hast taken pleasure, and all that thou hast loved, with  all that thou hast hated, -- I will even gather them round  about against thee, and will discover thy nakedness unto them,  that they may see all thy nakedness.
16:37|KJV|Behold, therefore I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loved, with all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather them round about against thee, and will discover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness.
16:37|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|所以我要將你一切所悅所愛的，連你一切所恨的，都聚集來，從四圍攻擊你；又將你的下體露出，使他們看盡了。
16:38|Darby|And I will judge thee with the judgments of women that  commit adultery and shed blood; and I will give thee up to the  blood of fury and jealousy;
16:38|KJV|And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy.
16:38|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|我也要審判你，像審判淫婦和流人血的婦女一樣；我要因忿怒妒忌，使流血的罪歸到你身上。
16:39|Darby|and I will give thee into their hand, and they shall throw  down thy place of debauchery, and shall break down thy high  places; and they shall strip thee of thy garments, and shall  take thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare.
16:39|KJV|And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high places: they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare.
16:39|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|我又要將你交在他們手中；他們必拆毀你的圓頂花樓，毀壞你的高臺，剝去你的衣服，奪取你的華美物件，留下你赤身露體。
16:40|Darby|And they shall bring up an assemblage against thee, and  they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with  their swords.
16:40|KJV|They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords.
16:40|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|他們也必帶多人來攻擊你，用石頭打死你，用刀將你砍碎。
16:41|Darby|And they shall burn thy houses with fire, and execute  judgments upon thee in the sight of many women; and I will  cause thee to cease from being a harlot, and thou also shalt  give no more any reward.
16:41|KJV|And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give no hire any more.
16:41|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|他們要用火焚燒你的房屋，在許多婦女眼前向你施行審判。我必使你不再行淫，也不再給人酬價。
16:42|Darby|And I will appease my fury against thee, and my jealousy  shall depart from thee; and I will be quiet, and will be no  more angry.
16:42|KJV|So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.
16:42|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|這樣，我就止息向你發的忿怒，我的妒忌也要離開你，我要安靜不再惱怒。
16:43|Darby|Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth,  but hast raged against me in all these [things], behold,  therefore, I also will recompense thy way upon [thy] head,  saith the Lord Jehovah, and thou shalt not commit this lewdness  besides all thine abominations.
16:43|KJV|Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast fretted me in all these things; behold, therefore I also will recompense thy way upon thine head, saith the Lord GOD: and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations.
16:43|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|因你不追念你幼年的日子，在這一切的事上向我發烈怒，所以在我這一面，我必照你所行的報應在你頭上，你就不再在你一切可憎的事以外，又犯這淫行；這是主耶和華說的。
16:44|Darby|Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall speak in a  proverb against thee, saying, As the mother, [so is] her  daughter!
16:44|KJV|Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.
16:44|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|凡說俗語的，必用俗語攻擊你，說，有其母，必有其女。
16:45|Darby|Thou art the daughter of thy mother that loathed her  husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy  sisters, who loathed their husbands and their children. Your  mother was a Hittite, and your father an Amorite.
16:45|KJV|Thou art thy mother's daughter, that lotheth her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, which lothed their husbands and their children: your mother was an Hittite, and your father an Amorite.
16:45|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|你正是你母親的女兒，她厭棄自己的丈夫和兒女；你正是你姊妹的姊妹，她們厭棄自己的丈夫和兒女。你們的母親是赫人，你們的父親是亞摩利人。
16:46|Darby|And thine elder sister is Samaria that dwelleth at thy  left hand, she and her daughters; and thy younger sister, that  dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.
16:46|KJV|And thine elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.
16:46|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|你的姐姐是撒瑪利亞，她和她的眾女兒住在你左邊；你的妹妹是所多瑪，她和她的眾女兒住在你右邊。
16:47|Darby|And thou hast not walked in their ways, nor done according  to their abominations; but as though that were a very little,  thou hast been more corrupt than they in all thy ways.
16:47|KJV|Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations: but, as if that were a very little thing, thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways.
16:47|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|你不是只按她們所行的去行，也不是只照她們可憎的事去作，你倒以那為小事，你一切所行的比她們更壞。
16:48|Darby|[As] I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, Sodom thy sister hath  not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and  thy daughters!
16:48|KJV|As I live, saith the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.
16:48|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|主耶和華說，我指著我的生存起誓，你妹妹所多瑪與她的眾女兒，尚未行過你和你眾女兒所行的事。
16:49|Darby|Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom: pride,  fulness of bread, and careless ease was in her and in her  daughters, but she did not strengthen the hand of the poor and  needy.
16:49|KJV|Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.
16:49|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|你妹妹所多瑪的罪孽是這樣：她和她的眾女兒都心驕氣傲，糧食豐足，大享安逸，並沒有扶助困苦和窮乏人的手。
16:50|Darby|And they were haughty, and committed abomination before  me, and I took them away when I saw [it].
16:50|KJV|And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good.
16:50|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|她們狂傲，在我面前行可憎的事；因此，我一看見便將她們除掉。
16:51|Darby|And Samaria hath not sinned according to the half of thy  sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than  they, and hast justified thy sisters by all thine abominations  which thou hast done.
16:51|KJV|Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done.
16:51|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|撒瑪利亞沒有犯你一半的罪，你行可憎的事比她們更多，使你的姊妹因你所行一切可憎的事，倒顯為義。
16:52|Darby|Thou also, who hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own  confusion, because of thy sins in which thou hast acted more  abominably than they: they are more righteous than thou. So be  thou ashamed also, and bear thy confusion, in that thou hast  justified thy sisters.
16:52|KJV|Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they: they are more righteous than thou: yea, be thou confounded also, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.
16:52|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|你既斷定你姊妹當受羞辱，就也要擔當自己的羞辱；因你所犯的罪比她們更為可憎，她們就比你更顯為義；你既使你的姊妹更顯為義，你就要抱愧擔當自己的羞辱。
16:53|Darby|And I will bring again their captivity, the captivity of  Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her  daughters, and the captivity of thy captives in the midst of  them;
16:53|KJV|When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then will I bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them:
16:53|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|我必叫她們被擄的歸回，就是叫所多瑪和她眾女兒被擄的，撒瑪利亞和她眾女兒被擄的，並你們在他們中間一同被擄的，都要歸回；

16:56|Darby|Yea, Sodom thy sister was not mentioned by thy mouth in  the day of thy pride,

16:58|Darby|Thy lewdness and thine abominations, thou bearest them,  saith Jehovah.

16:59|KJV|For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.

34:21|KJV|Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad;
34:21|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|因為你們用脅用肩擁擠一切瘦弱的，又用角牴觸，以致把他們驅散在外，
34:22|Darby|-- I will save my flock, that they may no more be a prey;  and I will judge between sheep and sheep.

35:5|KJV|Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed the blood of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time that their iniquity had an end:
