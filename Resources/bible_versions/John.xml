8:25|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|他們就對祂說，你是誰？耶穌對他們說，基本上，就是我對你們所講說的。
8:26|ASV|I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you: howbeit he that sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these speak I unto the world.
8:26|Darby|I have many things to say and to judge concerning you, but  he that has sent me is true, and I, what I have heard from him,  these things I say to the world.
8:26|KJV|I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.
8:26|WYC|I have many things to speak, and to deem of you, but he that sent me is soothfast; and I speak in the world these things, that I heard of him.
8:26|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|關於你們，我有許多事要講說，要判斷；但那差我來的是真實的，我把從祂所聽見的這些事，對世人講說。
8:27|ASV|They perceived not that he spake to them of the Father.
8:27|Darby|They knew not that he spoke to them of the Father.
8:27|KJV|They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.
8:27|WYC|And they knew not, that he called his Father God. [And they knew not, for he said his Father God.]
8:27|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|他們不明白耶穌是在對他們講說父。
8:28|ASV|Jesus therefore said, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and  that I do nothing of myself, but as the Father taught me, I speak these things.
8:28|Darby|Jesus therefore said to them, When ye shall have lifted up  the Son of man, then ye shall know that I am [he], and [that] I  do nothing of myself, but as the Father has taught me I speak  these things.
8:28|KJV|Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.
8:28|WYC|Therefore Jesus said to them, When ye have araised man's Son, then ye shall know, that I am, and of myself I do nothing; but as my Father taught me, I speak these things.
8:28|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|所以耶穌對他們說，你們舉起人子以後，必知道我是，並且知道我不從自己作甚麼；我說這些話，乃是照著父所教訓我的。
8:29|ASV|And he that sent me is with me; he hath not left me alone; for I do always the things that are pleasing to him.
8:29|Darby|And he that has sent me is with me; he has not left me  alone, because I do always the things that are pleasing to him.
8:29|KJV|And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.
8:29|WYC|And he that sent me is with me, and left me not alone; for I do evermore those things, that be pleasing to him. [And he that sent me is with me, and left not me alone; for I do ever those things, that be pleasant to him.]
8:29|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|那差我來的是與我同在，祂沒有撇下我獨自一人，因為我始終作祂所喜悅的事。
8:30|ASV|As he spake these things, many believed on him.
8:30|Darby|As he spoke these things many believed on him.
8:30|KJV|As he spake these words, many believed on him.
8:30|WYC|When he spake these things, many believed in him.
8:30|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|耶穌說這些話的時候，就有許多人信入了祂。
8:31|ASV|Jesus therefore said to those Jews that had believed him, If ye abide in my word, then are ye truly my disciples;
8:31|Darby|Jesus therefore said to the Jews who believed him, If ye  abide in my word, ye are truly my disciples;
8:31|KJV|Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;

8:33|WYC|Therefore the Jews answered to him, We be the seed of Abraham, and we served never to [no] man; how sayest thou, That ye shall be free [how sayest thou, Ye shall be free]?
8:33|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|他們回答祂說，我們是亞伯拉罕的後裔，從來沒有被誰奴役過；你怎麼說，你們必得以自由？
8:34|ASV|Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Every one that committeth sin is the bondservant of sin.
8:34|Darby|Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say to you, Every  one that practises sin is the bondman of sin.
8:34|KJV|Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.
8:34|WYC|Jesus answered to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, each man that doeth sin, is [the] servant of sin.
8:34|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|耶穌回答他們說，我實實在在的告訴你們，凡犯罪的，就是罪的奴僕。
8:35|ASV|And the bondservant abideth not in the house for ever: the son abideth for ever.
8:35|Darby|Now the bondman abides not in the house for ever: the son  abides for ever.
8:35|KJV|And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever.
8:35|WYC|And the servant dwelleth not in the house without end [into without end], but the Son dwelleth without end [into without end].
8:35|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|奴僕不永遠住在家裡，兒子是永遠住在家裡。
8:36|ASV|If therefore the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.
8:36|Darby|If therefore the Son shall set you free, ye shall be really  free.
8:36|KJV|If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.
8:36|WYC|Therefore if the Son [shall] make you free, verily ye shall be free.
8:36|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|所以神的兒子若叫你們自由，你們就真自由了。
8:37|ASV|I know that ye are Abraham's seed: yet ye seek to kill me, because my word hath not free course in you.

8:41|WYC|Ye do the works of your father.  Therefore they said to him [And so they said to him], We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, God.
8:41|&#24674;&#24489;&#26412;|你們是行你們父所作的。他們對祂說，我們不是從淫亂生的；我們只有一位父，就是神。
8:42|ASV|Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I came forth and am come from God; for neither have I come of myself, but he sent me.
8:42|Darby|Jesus said to them, If God were your father ye would have  loved me, for I came forth from God and am come [from him]; for  neither am I come of myself, but *he* has sent me.
