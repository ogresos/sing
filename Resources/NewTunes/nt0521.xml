    <stanza type="verse" number="1">I thank Thee, Lord, that Thou hast shown,
  And I begin to see,
What Thou canst be to all Thine own,
  What they may be to Thee;
If only they will yield Thee all,
And trustingly obey Thy call.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">How wonderful! I never knew
  That I might trust Thee so;
That Thou wouldst be so much to me.
  In all the way I go,
That every need Thou wouldst supply.
And all my longings satisfy.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">I take Thee as my keeper now
  And I commit to Thee
My soul, my way, my works, my cause.
  In Thy sole charge to be;
And my deposit, Thou, I know
Wilt guard secure from every foe.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">I take Thee for my peace, O Lord.
  My heart to keep and fill
Thine own great calm, amid earth's storms
  Shall keep me always still;
And as Thy kingdom doth increase,
So shall Thine ever-deep'ning peace.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">I take Thee as my wisdom too
  For wisdom's sum Thou art;
Thou, who dost choose the foolish things.
  Set me henceforth apart,
That I may speak and work for Thee
As Thou shalt work and speak in me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">I take Thee, Lord, to be my all.
  Since all Thou art is mine;
I nothing have, and nothing am;
  That nothing, Lord, is Thine.
Thou shalt be everything to me
In all things my sufficiency.</stanza>
