    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Never did I dream before,
Such a place could e'er be found,
Where the tears of sorrow cease,
Songs of endless joy abound.
One who seldom ever sang,
Now delights his voice to raise;
Singing hymns with all the saints,
Echoing the ceaseless praise.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Day by day the world goes on,
Just as it has gone before.
Millions grasp and clutch at life,
Wond'ring if there could be more;
Such was I and would be, yet
Mercy found me out somehow;
With what gratefulness I say,
"I'm in God's own family now.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">How delightful 'tis to know;
How subjective, real, and sweet
Is this inward joy of grace
We experience when we meet;
Life abundant Jesus gives
As my full reality;
Praise You, Lord, it's really true,
I'm in Your own family.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">At the closing of this age,
Just before Your kingdom's dawn,
May You gain a people, Lord,
For Your dwelling place, Your home.
Since for me You gave Your all,
Everything I lay aside;
For Your church my all I'd give,
That You would be satisfied.</stanza>
