  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">There is a green hill far away,
  Without a city wall,
Where the dear Lord was crucified,
  Who died to save us all.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Oh, dearly, dearly has He loved,
  And died our sins to bear;
We trust in His redeeming blood,
    And life eternal share.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">We may not know, we cannot tell,
  What pains He had to bear;
But we believe it was for us
  He hung and suffered there.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">He died that we might be forgiven,
  He died to make us good,
That we might from our sins be freed,
  Saved by His precious blood.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">There was no other good enough
  To pay the price of sin,
He only could divine life give
  And dwell Himself within.</stanza>
