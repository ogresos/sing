  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">I am one with Thee, Lord Jesus,
  One in spirit now with Thee;
All Thyself I now possess, Lord,
  All Thou art now lives in me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">One with Thee, one with Thee,
  One with Thee, one with Thee;
Day by day I share Thy riches,
    Thou art everything to me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Now I share Thy human life, Lord,
  Filled with Thy humanity,
All of Thy complete obedience
  Is available to me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">One with Thee in crucifixion,
  On the cross I died in Thee;
I am dead unto the world, Lord,
  And the world is dead to me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">One with Thee in resurrection,
  Risen now to live in Thee,
With that life which is Thyself, Lord,
  Now in me, Lord, even me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">One with Thee in Thine ascension,
  In the heavens now with Thee;
Here a pilgrim and a stranger,
  My true life is hid in Thee.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">One with Thee in Thine enthronement,
  Sharing Thine authority,
Even as I share Thy life, Lord,
  I in Thee and Thou in me.</stanza>
