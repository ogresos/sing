    <stanza type="verse" number="1">I heard the voice of Jesus say,
  "Come unto Me, and rest;
Lay down, thou weary one, lay down
  Thy head upon My breast."
I came to Jesus as I was,
  Weary, and worn, and sad;
I found in Him a resting-place,
  And He has made me glad.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">I heard the voice of Jesus say,
  "Behold, I freely give
The living water: thirsty one,
  Stoop down, and drink, and live."
I came to Jesus, and I drank
  Of that life-giving stream;
My thirst was quenched, my soul revived,
  And now I live in Him.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">I heard the voice of Jesus say,
  "I am this dark world's Light;
Look unto Me, thy morn shall rise,
  And all thy day be bright."
I looked to Jesus, and I found
  In Him my Star, my Sun;
And in that Light of life I'll walk
  Till trav'lling days are done.</stanza>
