  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">In the secret of His presence
  How my soul delights to hide!
Oh, how precious are the lessons
  Which I learn at Jesus' side!
Earthly cares can never vex me,
  Neither trials lay me low;
For when Satan comes to tempt me,
  To the secret place I go.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">When my soul is faint and thirsty,
  'Neath the shadow of His wing
There is cool and pleasant shelter,
  And a fresh and crystal spring;
And my Savior rests beside me,
  As we hold communion sweet;
If I tried, I could not utter
  What He says when thus we meet.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Only this I know: I tell Him
  All my doubts and griefs and fears;
Oh, how patiently He listens!
  And my drooping soul He cheers;
Do you think He ne'er reproves me?
  What a false friend He would be,
If He never, never told me
  Of the sins which He must see.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Would you like to know that sweetness
  Of the secret of the Lord?
Go and hide beneath His shadow;
  This shall then be your reward;
And whene'er you leave the silence
  Of that happy meeting-place,
By the Spirit bear the image
  Of the Master in your face.</stanza>
    <stanza type="note" number="">(Repeat the last line of each stanza)</stanza>
