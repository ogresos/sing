    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Lord, reveal Thyself to me,
That the flesh I'll fully know;
May Thy grace so work in me,
That in dust I'll lowly bow.
How I long for victory,
Yet, thru all my life, how weak!
Evil things I cannot leave,
Nor can do the good I seek.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Inwardly I want the Lord,
But my conduct hateful is;
Though I would, I cannot change,
O what real bondage 'tis!
By God's law my sin's revealed,
But the law of sin doth bind;
Though I struggle to be free,
No release my soul can find.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Many times I fall and rise,
Oft resolve, and often fail;
Craving vict'ry, I retreat,
And my sad defeat bewail.
Truly I am sold to sin
And completely powerless;
There's no good within my flesh,
All is dark and sinfulness.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Now I know myself in part,
And confess my helplessness;
All my temperament is odd,
All my life corrupted is.
Subtle self I cannot trust,
Nor to fleshly strength can cling;
All my trust and all my hope
Is in Jesus Christ my King.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">May the Cross put me to death
That on Christ I may rely;
May His Holy Spirit fill,
That Himself I may apply.
May His death so work in me
Daily deeper than before,
That my self may be destroyed
And His life thru me may pour.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">O how bitter is my case!
Who this wretched slave can free,
Who deliver from this death,
To a life of victory?
Jesus shed His blood for me,
Christ is now my holiness;
I receive Him as my life
And my portion measureless.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Now I'm wholly sanctified,
Selfless, I obey His word;
Nevermore to feel ashamed
When I come before the Lord.
How transcendent is this life!
Grace thru faith He gives to me!
Praise the Lord, He heard my cry
And has made me wholly free.</stanza>
