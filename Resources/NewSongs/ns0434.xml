  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Listen closely now to His gospel free:
You were made by God to His vessel be;
You were formed as a man,
To fulfill His great plan:
Now He wants to be your life!
He will be so real to you,
Make your life so beautiful,
Full of joy, and meaningful,
If you come to Him.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">In eternity He selected you,
Then He came to earth in His love for you;
On the cross, His life gave,
Then He rose from the grave.
Coming forth to seek for you,
To bring God Himself to you,
Life divine impart to you,
Grace abundant give that you
May be satisfied.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">When the Triune God lives Himself in you,
He will change your being, your life renew;
You'll be quickened within,
Filled with joy to the brim,
And your flesh shall rest in hope!
Open now your heart to Him,
Breathe His name from deep within,
In an instant He'll come in
And with you be one!</stanza>
