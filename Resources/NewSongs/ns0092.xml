  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">We'd experience Christ daily,
Him we would constantly pursue.
Our pursuing has a purpose
To build His Body is our view.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Occupy us for Your Body.
Grace supplying, You afford.
Always bearing, always caring,
By Your grace we'd be outpoured.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Grant us, Lord, a willing spirit.
To build Your Body we would strive.
By our measure we would function,
Until full grown we'd all arrive.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">As the members of His Body,
Each one is now a life supply.
Serving Christ to one another,
In love, His Body built thereby.</stanza>
