  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Through God's dispensing, abundance of grace,
Christ's saving life will reign and death displace;
God's holy nature, our life sanctifies,
His saving life soon, our life glorifies,
His saving life soon, our life glorifies...
  (our life, glorifies.)</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">The law of life from our spirit within,
Saves us from death and the bondage of sin;
Spontaneously working, from slavery freed,
His divine life is forever increased,
His divine life is forever increased...
  (forever increased.)</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">The divine Trinity spreads through our soul,
To saturate our whole being, life's goal;
We become members, the Body of Christ,
Built up together by Christ's saving life,
Built up together by Christ's saving life...
  (by Christ's saving life.)</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Christ's saving life when expressed in each town,
Strengthens the saints causing grace to abound;
And by the reigning in life every church
Is blent together, and Satan is crushed,
Is blent together and Satan is crushed...
  (and Satan is crushed.)</stanza>
