  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">And let them make a sanctuary for Me,
That I may dwell in their midst,
Our prayer is "Lord, we give ourselves to Thee,
We'll be the builders for Your economy."</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Under a clear sky,
On the mountain,
Beholding the glory of the
Vision of His building,
That He may have His dwelling place,
That He may have His dwelling place.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">God needs a group of us to turn the age,
To fellowship and consecrate,
To be in oneness &amp;mdash; Yes! This is the way,
No pride or boasting, giving Him first place.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Our testimony in the church today,
Is the expression of God through man,
Let's be the pillars for His dwelling place,
But don't be passive &amp;mdash; trust in His way.</stanza>
