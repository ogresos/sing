    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Our condition was dead in offenses,
To the flesh we were enslaved.
But together with Christ Jesus He has raised us,
By His grace we have been saved. [Eph. 2:2-6]

God, Your mercy and Your love have reached us,
You have made us alive.
By Your Spirit entering our spirit,
In Your life we've been revived. [Eph. 2:4-5]</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">We were once far off but have become near
In the blood of the dear Son.
In His flesh abolished all the ordinances,
Thus creating two as one. [Eph. 2:13, 15]

We have access directly to the Father
Through Christ Jesus, our Lord
In one Spirit, whether Jew or Gentile,
Fellowship has been restored. [Eph. 2:18]</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Make the prayer that Paul had in Ephesians
The prayer in our daily plan.
Father strengthen us with power through Your Spirit,
Deep into the inner man. [Eph. 3:16]

Lord, keep spreading into every corner,
Lord, keep gaining each part.
We allow you to have the room within us.
Make Your home in all our heart. [Eph. 3:17]</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Lord, Your riches are so unsearchable.
I can never comprehend. 
But with all the saints in such a corporate church life
Your dimensions apprehend. [Eph. 3:8, 18-19]

By Your mercy, keep me in Your Body,
Taking the rich supply.
Through each member's function in their measure
All the Body edify. [Eph. 4:16]</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Deep within You is the greatest mystery,
One that countless men have searched.
But to us You have unveiled the revelation,
Now we see Christ and the church. [Eph. 5:32]

Lord, we're wholly for Your heart's desire&amp;mdash;
Make Your church sanctified.
Through the washing in the pure word's water
May You gain Your glorious Bride. [Eph. 5:25-26]</stanza>
