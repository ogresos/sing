    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Oh Jesus, dearest, precious Lord,
We love, we love with all of our heart.
Please make Your home, Lord, more in us.
Lord, spread and gain each part
'Till all our being belongs to You;
Surrender, Lord, ourselves unto You.
Oh Jesus, dearest, precious Lord,
We treasure You with all of our heart.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">We love, we love with all of our hearts.
Please make Your home, Lord, more in us.
Keep spreading until Your work is done.
We're drawn and captured by You, Lord.
You've won our hearts so joyously.
We cannot help but fall in love with You.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">A purer, deeper lover of Christ;
Lord, keep our hearts so tenderly.
Teach us to trust You and obey.
Lord, soften and renew.
Lord, capture us, appear to us.
You're matchless in Your beauty and worth.
Abide, we, in Your preciousness;
We're lovers of this living Person.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">We thank You, Lord, You're reality.
So sweet and comely is Your presence.
You're precious and You're lovely, Dear Lord Jesus.
We're drawn and captured by You, Lord.
You've won our hearts so joyously.
We can't but help, Lord, fall in love with You.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">We long that You'd be satisfied.
Lord, grant our hearts for You to burn.
Appear to us, Lord, day by day,
Until we're fully drawn.
We come to You by Your embrace,
We cling to You, Lord, by Your might.
Lord, grow in us, make home in us.
Oh Lord, You're our Beloved Bridegroom.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">We love, we love with all of our hearts.
Please make Your home, Lord, more in us.
Keep spreading until Your work is done.
We're drawn and captured by You, Lord.
You've won our hearts so joyously.
We cannot help but fall in love with You.</stanza>
