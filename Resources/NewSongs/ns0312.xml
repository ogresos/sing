  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">God realized by us,
With Christ identified&amp;mdash;
God reconciled us to Himself,
Now Christ, identified!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Born into Adam, we&amp;mdash;
But transferred now to Christ;
Made one with Christ, as baptized ones,
Growing togeth'r with Him.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">In likeness of His death,
That is, newness of life&amp;mdash;
Ourselves be reckoned dead to sin,
But live to God, in Christ.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">We would present ourselves,
To God, from dead&amp;mdash;alive.
Present our members "righteous slaves,"
Become thus sanctified.</stanza>
