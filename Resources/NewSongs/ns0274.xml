    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Lord, Thou has been our dwelling place in all generations.
Before the mountains were brought forth,
Or ever Thou has formed the earth and the world,
Even from eternity to eternity,
Thou art God.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">For a thousand years in Thy sight are but yesterday,
When it is past as a watch in the night.
So teach us to number our days,
That we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">O satisfy us early with Thy mercy,
That we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
Make us glad according to the days,
And the years wherein we have seen evil.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Let Thy work appear unto Thy servants,
And Thy glory unto their children.
And let the beauty of the Lord,
The beauty of the Lord, our God be upon us.
(Repeat chorus as finale)</stanza>
