    <stanza type="verse" number="1">I love my Master, and I will not go out free.
For He has died for me, the highest price He has paid for me.
I love my Master, I will serve Him willingly. 
Remaining near, and close to Him this my plea.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">I love You Master, from You I will never leave.
You are my liberty, and my joy complete.
I love my Master, and I will not go out free.
To Him I give my all, my life eternally!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Oh Jesus, Master, to the door post now bring me.
Open my ears to hear, Your voice and all that You say to me.
Oh Jesus, Master, I will obey willingly.
To love and serve Him all my life, this my plea!</stanza>
