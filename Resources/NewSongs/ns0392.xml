  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Our God is one and yet triune,
The Father in the Son;
Successive stages were His plan,
The Spirit to become;
The first One sent the second One,
Yet, both are still the same;
The first One sent the third One, and,
We're baptized in His name.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">The Spirit of the Triune God
Is God's economy;
The consummated Holy One
Flows on and on eternally.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Though God in nature cannot change,
He passed through womb and cross;
The Lamb of God has been prepared,
Yet, nothing has been lost.
The Spirit is the compound God;
The One that was "not yet";
The seven Spirits, seven eyes,
Today are "The Spirit".</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">The processed God, the flowing God,
Is the eternal source;
Emerging in a bubbling spring,
An overflowing course.
The Father's love, a fountain is;
The Son, as grace, the spring;
The fellowshipping Spirit flows
Out from our inmost being.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">The Spirit is a holy realm,
Divine and mystical;
We enter in and live by Him,
He is so practical.
Sevenfold intensified,
The Spirit's final stage,
Will overcomers soon produce,
To consummate the age.</stanza>
