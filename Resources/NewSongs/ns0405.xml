    <stanza type="verse" number="">Saying, Where is He
Who has been born King of the Jews?
For we saw His star at its rising,
For we saw His star at its rising
And have come to worship Him.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="">And when they saw the star,
They rejoiced exceedingly,
Rejoiced exceedingly with great joy.
And when they saw the star,
They rejoiced exceedingly,
Rejoiced exceedingly with great joy.</stanza>
