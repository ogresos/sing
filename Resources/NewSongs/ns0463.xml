    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Lord, Thou hast won my heart;
With Thee I love to be;
There's not one thing, save what Thou art,
My heart desires to see.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">What else could I desire
In heaven or on earth?
To this alone I would aspire:
To know Thy peerless worth.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Thou art my heart's delight,
The Sweetest of the sweet;
All else becomes devoid of taste
When once compared to Thee.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Lord, on account of Thee
All other loves grow pale;
Chiefest among ten thousand, Thou
Dost e'er o'er all prevail.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Enamored of Thyself
I forfeit all to Thee,
For 'tis when I have nothing that
I've everything in Thee.</stanza>
