    <stanza type="verse" number="1">We turn our hearts to You, Lord.
    Make us all so true,
Blend our hearts together, make all things new.
    As we turn away
    From this earthly dross,
What was gain before we now count as loss.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Every day we find You living
In our spirit&amp;mdash;the full supply;
How we're blessed that
You are giving all You are to us in life.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">As we set our mind
    On You, living One,
In our spirit, Lord, we find we are one.
    What was once our case
    Seem to slip away
As we fellowship with You, we long to stay.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">I would linger here
    In Your presence, Lord;
How we find our hearts loving You more.
    As we guard our hearts,
    Keep them unto Thee,
Preserve us, Lord, for all eternity.</stanza>
