    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Until He comes again,
I'll watch and wait and call on Him
I'll pray that by His life and power,
I'll overcome in every hour.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Until He comes again,
His blood will cleanse me of my sin
His word will sanctify within,
And make me wholly unto Him.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">(Bro.) He died to be life to me&amp;mdash;
         From death I'm free.
(Sis.) He rose and as Spirit He
         Now lives in me.
(Bro.) In splendor and in glory
         Like Him I'll be.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Until He comes again,
My soul-life I'll give up for Him.
No worldly pleasure can compare
To what my Savior has to share.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">And when He comes again,
All saints built up and one in Him.
His Body, Bride, and Counterpart,
Eternal pleasure of His heart.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">(Sis.) Lord, gain Your kingdom in me,
         I long to be...
(Bro.) One with my Savior and King,
         Eternally.
(Sis.) Oh, what a joy it will be
         Your face to see.</stanza>
