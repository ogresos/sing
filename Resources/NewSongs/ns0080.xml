  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Our Christ is so enjoyable,
His life is so applicable;
He lives in us to cause the flow
To reach the world, His life to show.
Oh saints, don't just sit idly by;
Rise up! Your gift do not despise;
Let's eat and drink of this sweet Christ!</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Let's enjoy Christ to reach the goal,
Partake of Him to beat the foe,
All His vast riches we extol,
Yes, we are freed from every woe!
We may not know a lot of things,
But we are kept from Satan's stings
By eating Christ, and Christ alone!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">We all can do so many things,
But first of all to Christ we'll cling;
Enjoy Him, blessings then He'll bring,
His life-supply means everything!
Enjoy Him&amp;mdash;grace He will bestow,
And we'll be led to join the flow;
Yes, we will do all things in Him.</stanza>
