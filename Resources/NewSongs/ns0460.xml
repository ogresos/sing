    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Thou, Triune God, eternally
Distinctly three, insep'rably one;
A realm divine and mystical,
Art formed as an incorporation.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">By Thine indwelling mutually 
Thou doth exist essentially;
Thy will to bring humanity
Into this sphere economically.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Through incarnation in the Son
This realm was first seen in the flesh;
Within Christ's body physical
The Godhead's fullness manifest.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">His human life did manifest
Coordination beauteous:
One acted, Three did operate
In harmony so marvelous.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Through death and resurrection was
This life divine in full released
To form Thy Body mystical,
This realm divine to thus increase.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">This habitation's Thine abode,
Thy Body mystical, divine,
Enlargement of our Father's house,
The Spirit's child, Son's spreading vine.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Thy final form the Spirit is,
The realization of the Son;
With Thee we're blent, divine-human
Incorporation to become.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">Thy Spirit into ours has come,
One mingled spirit formed, become
The Body, Father, Spirit, Son&amp;mdash;
An entity that's Four yet One.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="9">By Thine own glory, life, and word
Here we are all thus one in Thee;
Such oneness doth reflect Thine own,
The oneness seen among the Three.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="10">God's love, Christ's grace, the fellowship
Of Holy Spirit, reaching man
As living water, issue from             
The throne of God and of the Lamb.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="11">This fellowship of life divine
Our Father and His Son have shared;
We're called into this fellowship,
Which the apostles have declared.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="12">The Spirit with our spirit is
The factor for us to be one,
The key to live the Christian life,
And secret of our salvation.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="13">The ministry of Christ in full
Within this realm is carried out,
And God's complete salvation too
Within this sphere is brought about.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="14">In all their living and their work
This mingled life th' apostles sought,
The Triune God to manifest
In character and service wrought.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="15">In all our living and our work
So we must also do the same,
In daily life, we would make this
Our top priority and aim.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="16">As therefore we have thus received,
So in all things we walk in Thee;
Thine all-inclusiveness to grasp,
We call and pray unceasingly.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="17">We live in Thee and Thou with us
In two-way traffic mutually:
In Thee we live, exist, and move,
Abide uninterruptedly.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="18">Thy name which Thou hast given us
Denotes Thy Person as our sphere,
Sum total of Thy Being, Lord,
Into which we've been gathered here.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="19">Thou art in us Thy kingdom too;
With joy and peace and righteousness.
Eternal life's totality,
The church life, sphere in which we're blessed.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="20">The New Jerusalem will be
This realm's domain perpetually;
Thou in the Father, we in Thee,
And Thou in us eternally.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="21">O, may we see, experience
The realm of Thine economy
In all the details of our life
To practice living one with Thee.</stanza>
