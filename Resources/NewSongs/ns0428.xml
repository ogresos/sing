    <stanza type="verse" number="1">In the clefts of the rock
I delight to be.
In the covert of the precipice
You would find me.
Lord, conform me now,
Daily to Your death.
Let me see Your countenance,
I am a dove,
In the clefts of the rock.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">My Beloved responds:
Rise up my love,
My beauty and come away;
The rain is gone.
The winter is past,
The time of singing has come.
Rise up and come away,
You are my dove,
In the clefts of the rock.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">It's just so difficult,
In these clefts to remain.
Naught but Your resurrection power
Could me sustain.
Now to Your call I respond,
From introspection to come.
Now and always, my Beloved,
I'd be Your dove,
In the clefts of the Rock.</stanza>
