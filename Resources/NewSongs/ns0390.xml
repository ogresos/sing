  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Let us work together with the Lord through prayer,
Praying every time and everywhere.
He will not accomplish His will on His own;
Seek Him ‘till His purpose is made known.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Make us those who're one with You in prayer,
Echoing the things for which You care.
Lord, do make us one so that Your heart's desire we share;
In this age, Lord gain Your men of prayer.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Let us open to the Lord Himself through prayer,
Breathe Him deeply as the living air.
Gain the life supply by praying into Him,
'Till our being's filled up to the brim.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Let us fellowship with God in spir't through prayer;
There is nothing else that can compare.
Lord, we realize there's nothing we can do,
But all things are possible through You.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Let us move together with the Lord through prayer;
For His move on earth we must prepare.
Lord do grow in us 'till we're matured in life,
As Your army fully qualified.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Let us fight together with the Lord through prayer;
Over death, Christ's vict'ry we declare.
One with the ascended Christ; we soar in prayer,
Fight as one for God's move everywhere.</stanza>
