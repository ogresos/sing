  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">There's a gospel of today
That says believe and you'll be saved and then
You can go to heaven and see the pearly gates
And walk the golden streets;
Words like these fail to treat
All the vanity that is hidden in me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">But the gospel is to me
The Triune God within humanity
As the Spirit reaching me to be in me
The one reality;
Love untold&amp;mdash;Gospel Thee
Never getting old&amp;mdash;story told eternally.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Left the ninety-nine behind&amp;mdash;
You searched until the lost sheep You did find,
Laid me on Your shoulders there, You bore me in
Your tender loving care;
Rejoicing&amp;mdash;You found me
Though a small lost sheep&amp;mdash;You gave all to come find me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Sweeping in my deepest parts,
You lit a lamp and searched my inward heart,
Sanctifying deep within You shined in me,
Exposed me of my sin;
Repenting&amp;mdash;now I see
Lord, You're sprinkling me&amp;mdash;with the blood You shed for me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Eagerly awaiting me
That I the slightest turn to Thee would make
Though my life had been a wreck, You ran to me
And fell upon my neck
Kissing me, affectionately;
Killed the calf for me&amp;mdash;"Let us eat and be merry."</stanza>
