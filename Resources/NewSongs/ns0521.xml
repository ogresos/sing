  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">On the cross You gave Your life for me,
That I might live again.
In resurrection You have lifted me
To newness born within.
Through the blood I repent of all my sins,
Precious Lord I now give in;
Fill me Lord Jesus,
Lord, I ask You to come in.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Upon my heart Lord write Your law,
So the Christ in me may grow.
Renew me in my mind too, Lord,
That Your light through me may show;
Calling, "O Lord Jesus!"
Wherever I may be;
Thank You sweet, sweet Jesus,
For today You set me free.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Lord, I really love You,
You're everything I need.
Make Your home within my heart,
Only You I will believe.
Loving You and living You
With a heart that's pure and true;
O dear Lord Jesus,
I trust my life to You.</stanza>
