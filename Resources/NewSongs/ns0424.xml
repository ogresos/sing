    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Christ desires to marry us,
By His Word He's preparing us,
To present the church glorious
To Himself, as His Bride.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="">Saints, enjoy the Word every day,
Get those blemishes washed away;
Open your Bibles, rejoice always,
Singing to the Lord.</stanza>

By His Word He's preparing us,
To present the church glorious
To Himself, as His Bride.</stanza>
