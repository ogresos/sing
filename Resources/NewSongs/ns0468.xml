    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Lord, in that coming day
When all will bow the knee,
'Twill be a commonplace display
To waste one's all on Thee.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">For Thee, Lord, on that day
Ten thousand hearts would break,
And if there were ten thousand worlds,
These all, men would forsake.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">But now, while yet 'tis rare,
My being won't delay;
Inspired by Thy love, could I,
Thy noble tribute stay?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">My all I gladly give
In love's response to Thee,
For how can I withhold my all
When Thou gav'st all for me?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Time's window soon shall close;
Now, while 'tis open still,
This golden moment I'd redeem,
Thy house with fragrance fill.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">The moments fly apace;
Lord, Thou art coming soon!
Can I delay, and fail to grasp
This moment opportune?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">While there is still today
(Beyond, no guarantee),
Seizing this opportunity,
I waste myself on Thee.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">That woman's noble deed
Was for Thy going wrought;
In view of Thy return, I too
Would offer as I ought.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="9">Two resurrections tell
The foolish from the wise;
Some would "beforehand" pay the price
And lukewarmness despise.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="10">I dare not passive be
But fully consecrate
"Beforehand", lest I miss my chance,
And risk arriving late.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="11">There is but one regret
Both hell and heaven hold&amp;mdash;
The loss of opportunity
Eternity unfolds.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="12">Performing love's sweet task,
While time doth still permit,
I break mine alabaster flask
And Thine own love requit.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="13">May this be, in that day
When I Thy coming hail
(E'en if I sleep and wait for Thee),
Our love's memorial.</stanza>
