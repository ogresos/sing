  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Morning dawn had arisen,
Abraham saddled his donkey,
Took his two young men with him
And Isaac, his beloved son.
Lord, You're God's only Son
And of God begotten
"This is My beloved Son, in whom
I am well-pleased."</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">To his young men he said then,
"Stay and we'll return to you."
To Moriah he led him,
His son Isaac, just them two.
Just the son and the father,
Speaking with one another.
Isaac said, "My father!" Abraham
    said, "Here I am."</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">As You spoke with Your Father
You bore the wood God laid on You;
As a lamb to the slaughter
Obedient to the death were You.
Precious blood of a Lamb,
Slain from when earth began,
Laid Your life down for Your sheep, in love,
    that I might live.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Man of sorrows, I love You.
From You men did hide their face.
With no majesty to You,
Despised, forsaken, and disgraced.
For my sins You were crushed.
Lord, I love You so much.
Chastened, scourged and then pierced through, my griefs
    and sorrows bore.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Dead in sins and offenses,
I'm a bruised reed&amp;mdash;smoking flax.
Yet to death You were given,
For of Your sheep, You'd not lose one.
Like the woman, I'd weep,
Flow my tears at Your feet.
Jesus Lord, I just love You&amp;mdash;dear Lord,
    Jesus my Lord.</stanza>
