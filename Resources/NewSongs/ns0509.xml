  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Father with Thee in secret I would be, 
Just to allow Thy Son to pray through me;
Waiting in love to hear Thy blest reply,
Thy heart revealed to me in Christ thereby.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Father with Thee in secret I would meet,
E'er to delight in, fellowship so sweet;
In Thy blest Son, abundant life's supplied,
My empty, broken heart is satisfied.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Father with Thee in secret I would meet,
Closed to the world with all its dark deceit,
Only the fragrance of Thy lovely Son
Passing between us, He our rest becomes.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Father with Thee in secret I'd remain,
Letting Thy light my thoughts and will make plain,
Thy Son, my only plea, I now embrace,
Sheltered in Him from my unholy ways.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Father with Thee in secret I would be,
Seeking Thy will's fulfillment thus to see,
Christ as the first in all things big and small;
Heaven and earth Thy glory shown to all.</stanza>
