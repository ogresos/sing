  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">I'm pressing on the God-man way,
New Christ I'm gaining every day,
Still groaning through this world of strife
I want to live a God-man life!</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Lord grow in me! You are the seed,
Of God-man life; You're all I need.
In all my heart, I give You ground.
Lord, may Your life in me abound!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">My heart has no desire to stay,
On hardened ground, in the world's way.
Satan no more shall steal Your Word,
I'll move my heart where You are heard!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">I want to deal with rocks in me,
From hidden sins, I would be free.
My heart I would clear up through prayer,
I'll gain more depth to root You there!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">The choking thorns, us barren make,
The life seed soon they'll overtake.
Riches, anxiety reject,
Just for God's growth the ground protect!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">The sun must shine for us to grow,
So persecution we will know.
When it seems more than we can bear,
Lord, help us drink You deeply there!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">We want to grow to utmost height,
Until Your Body comes in sight.
Yourself in man will then be shown;
Your plan at last by all be known!</stanza>
