    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Glory! Glory! Christ is life in me,
As the Spirit leading constantly!
What was weak is mighty,
What was dark is light,
Glory! Glory! Christ is life in me!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Glory, Glory! Living by the Lord,
Walking by the Spirit in His Word!
Failure's turned to vict'ry,
Sighing's turned to praise.
Glory! Glory! Living by the Lord!</stanza>
