    <stanza type="verse" number="1">In the Holy Bible
Is a central line,
Truths and revelation
Span the bridge of time.
'Midst the supplemental
And the "branch" or "leaf"
Is the Christ anointed
For eternity.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Christ in the beginning
Was the Word of God;
As a living person
Christ on earth did trod.
As the Word Incarnate
He is God defined,
So that by His speaking
Life and light men find.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Father, Son, and Spirit
Is the Triune One;
Mutually indwelling,
Father in the Son;
Enjoyed in the Spirit,
Accessed through the Son,
Unto God, the Father
All are joined as one.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">God by His dispensing,
God's economy,
Will fulfill His purpose
In His trinity;
From the loving Father,
Through the Son as grace,
In the mingled Spirit,
Is His dwelling place.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Christ is all-inclusive,
All-inheriting;
Firstborn of creation,
First in everything;
Son of God effulgent,
Bright, extensive, vast,
Christ, High Priest and Builder,
Is the First and Last.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Jesus Christ, the Spirit,
All-inclusive cure,
Is a compound ointment,
Life-giving and pure;
By His sweet anointing
All are sanctified;
For the church, the Spirit
Is intensified.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Living in the Body,
Body life is known,
Living by the Spirit
Christ is fully grown;
By organic union
Members cultivate
Body-conscious living,
Age to consummate.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">See the Holy City,
God's supernal goal,
God's organic blueprint,
His eternal scroll;
Corporate reproduction,
New Jerusalem,
Bride of Christ presented;
Worship, praise to Him.</stanza>
