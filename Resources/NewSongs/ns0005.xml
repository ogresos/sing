  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">This unique truth the whole Bible unveils:
Our God has put on humanity;
Both God and man, as the Scripture reveals;
Hallelujah unto eternity.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Praise the Lord for Christ's humanity!
It's central to God's economy
To produce a divine-human incorporation
Which consummates the New Jerusalem.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Old Testament portrays Christ as a Man,
With four types showing His humanity:
Seed of the woman, seed of Abraham,
The seed of David, branch of Jesse.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Christ as a Man in His humanity
Visited Abraham, with Jacob fought,
Met Joshua as Captain of God's army,
Foretold of Samson, Israel's comfort.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">As Man of sorrows He lived, and was slain,
Suffered, despised, our redemption to win.
According to righteousness He will reign,
There'll be enjoyment and protection.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Above the firmament, Christ is enthroned,
Satan's dominion is far, far below.
Each measurement of God's building He knows,
In midst of Israel, His possession.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Christ as a Man walked with Daniel's three friends,
In fiery trial appearing with them;
Met Daniel's need as a Man once again;
He's everything in God's move as a Man.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Though they dispersed, Christ was with Israel,
Measured Jerus'lem to gain her in full;
As Shoot of David, God's temple He'll build,
He'll be a Priest and o'er all nations rule.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">As Son of Man, He's with Israel involved,
With us as well: we His oneness enjoy;
He's stock of Israel exalted by God,
He'll gain the Kingdom, enemies destroy.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="9">Christ as revealed in the New Testament
Came in the flesh; Son of Man now is He!
Fulfillment of God's economy,
All carried out in Christ's humanity.</stanza>
