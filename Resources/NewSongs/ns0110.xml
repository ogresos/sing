    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Life's too short
To waste a single day
The kingdom's life
Is closer everyday.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">In the midst of time,
The kingdom's mine
Just by calling on His name each day.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">The sweetest taste
Of life is deep within.
Its flowing out
Is primed by calling Him.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">In the midst of time,
The kingdom's mine
Just by calling on His name each day.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Time is quickly
Running out each day.
The Lord will come
And swiftly end this age.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">At the end of time,
The goal we'll see
The millennium is our entry.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">At the end of time,
The goal we'll see
The New Jerusalem we'll be.</stanza>
