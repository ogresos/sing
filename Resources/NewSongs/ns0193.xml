    <singingstanza>It is God's com -- mand -- ment and it is His de -- sire That His peo -- ple call, call up -- on His name. It's the joy -- ful way, the joy -- ful way to drink From the foun -- tain of God's rich sal -- va -- tion. Call -- ing is the way to de -- light one -- self in God; That is to en -- joy Him, en -- joy the Lord our God. Hence, we as God's peo -- ple, must dai -- ly call on Him. This must be our prac -- tice for God's ju -- bi -- lee.</singingstanza>

  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">It is God's commandment and it is His desire
That His people call, call upon His name.
It's the joyful way, the joyful way to drink
From the fountain of God's rich salvation.
Calling is the way to delight oneself in God;
That is to enjoy Him, enjoy the Lord our God.
Hence, we as God's people, must daily call on Him.
This must be our practice for God's jubilee.</stanza>
