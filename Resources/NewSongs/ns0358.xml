  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Lord, You revealed Yourself to me,
You showed me Your purpose,
To have the church as Your body
So You can mingle all that You are.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Though I am blinded by self and flesh
But You, dear Lord, have chosen me
As a vessel to contain You
And express You 'til You come back.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Forgive me, Lord I'm open to You.
Fill me more and more each day.
Build me with the saints in love
And keep us running toward the prize.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Lord keep me growing and functioning.
Don't ever let me out of Your sight.
Grant me a spirit of boldness.
Open my mouth, Lord, to prophesy.</stanza>
