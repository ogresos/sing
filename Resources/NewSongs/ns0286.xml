    <stanza type="chorus" number="">We have a Father
Whose heart is full of love toward us.
His heart is so great
And His love is so unlimited.
Even when we sin,
We can always come back to Him;
This is our Father's great love toward us.
We just need to repent,
In His loving arms we were meant;
This is our Father's great love toward us.</stanza>
