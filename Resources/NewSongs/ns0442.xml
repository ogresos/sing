    <stanza type="verse" number="1">In God's economy Christ is unique;
He holds the first place and centrality.
All is in Him, through Him, and unto Him;
He is all&amp;mdash;the universality.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Christ plus nothing,
Christ plus nothing is everything;
In God's eternal economy
Christ plus nothing equals everything.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Within the Godhead the center is Christ,
In Him the fullness is pleased thus to dwell;
All that the Father is He doth express
And of His Person the Spirit doth tell.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">The universe was created through Christ,
In Him do all things cohere and subsist;
Framed by His Word and upheld by His power,
As the Firstborn in whom all things exist.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Looking away from the prophets and law,
Christ, God's delight and beloved, we see;
For all things testify concerning Him,
Of all the shadows, the body is He.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">In the new man Christ is all and in all,
In resurrection the Firstborn is He,
All persons, matters, and things are crossed out,
Christ alone is the constituency.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">The New Jerusalem will consummate
With Christ, as Head, over all things to be
The Lamb enthroned&amp;mdash;its unique centerpiece
Ruling and reigning for eternity.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Christ as the element, sphere, means, and goal
Must be our center, our focus, and aim;
In God's economy Christ must be all:
The inward substance and the outward frame.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">Oh, may it be&amp;mdash;Christ plus nothing in me;
Neither my old man self-cultivating
Nor substitute, nor addition to Thee
But Christ as all and in all&amp;mdash;everything.</stanza>
