    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Recall how David swore,
"I'll not come into my house,
Nor go up to my bed,
Give slumber to mine eyelids,
Until I find a place for Thee,
A place, O Lord, for Thee."
Our mighty God desires a home
Where all His own may come.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">How blinded we have been:
"We'll build Your habitation"
When we are short of Christ&amp;mdash;
We need Your saturation!
O Lord, You care for our house!
Oh, what a blessed word!
As You're to God, You'd be to us&amp;mdash;
A mutual abode.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">There's nothing that we are
Or have or do well-pleasing;
We need Thee, glorious Christ,
Inwrought into our being.
O Lord, our heart's still vacant now!
Come in and settle down.
Come saturate and permeate
And fill us with Yourself.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Our spirit You have filled
At our regeneration,
But mind, emotion, will
Await Your saturation.
How much of You is built in us
To make our heart Your home?
O Triune God, we welcome You.
Come build, oh, build in us.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Into our innermost
Intrinsic constitution,
Come, Lord, Yourself dispense
By constant, fresh infusion;
Transform us, Lord, and work Yourself,
As God's embodiment,
Into our heart, and life each part,
With Your reality.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">To build Your house today,
Self-effort You're refusing&amp;mdash;
All stubble, wood, and hay;
Gold, silver, gems, You're using.
The consummated Triune God
Transmitted into us
Now builds Himself into a home&amp;mdash;
His dwelling, glorious.
(Repeat the last four lines)</stanza>
