    <singingstanza>My love is like a dove, In the clefts of the rock, In the cov -- ert of the prec -- i -- pice, That's where My love is safe. At this se -- cret place we meet, Here your voice, my love, is sweet; Your coun -- te -- nance is love -- ly, And here you're pleas -- ing to Me. Let Me hear your voice; See your coun -- te -- nance; For your voice is so sweet, And you're love -- ly. Let Me hear your voice, See your coun -- te -- nance; For your voice is so sweet, And you're love -- ly to me.</singingstanza>

    <stanza type="verse" number="1">My love is like a dove,
In the clefts of the rock,
In the covert of the precipice,
That's where My love is safe.

At this secret place we meet,
Here your voice, my love, is sweet;
Your countenance is lovely,
And here you're pleasing to Me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Let Me hear your voice;
See your countenance;
For your voice is so sweet,
And you're lovely.

Let Me hear your voice,
See your countenance;
For your voice is so sweet,
And you're lovely to me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">My love is like a dove,
In the clefts of the rock,
In the covert of the precipice,
That's where you're lovely.

At this secret place we meet,
Here your voice, my love, is sweet;
Your countenance is lovely,
And you're lovely to Me.</stanza>
