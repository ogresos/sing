    <stanza type="verse" number="1">O there's One in me who
Is the most lovely One
In the whole universe&amp;mdash;
I just love Him.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">He has made me fall in love
With Him more and more each day:
And for now that I'm in love&amp;mdash;
I'll always stay.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">For my Jesus has captured my heart.
He has wrecked me with all He can impart.
He drew me to Himself,
Now I love nothing else.
His beauty, love and charm won my heart.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">As the days go on and on
There's a hold that is so strong.
A tide floods all my being&amp;mdash;
For I'm in love.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">There's a face I long to see
Whose arms will embrace me.
As I rest in this sweet place
I love Him more and more.</stanza>
