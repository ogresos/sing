    <singingstanza>Here we are gath -- ered, one fam -- ily in the Lord; His life is the bond that we share. Al -- though we are man -- y, we are in one ac -- cord, And as the mem -- bers, know the fam -- ily care. And blend -- ing with the saints we know, Our joy has just be -- gun; We blend to -- geth -- er and we blend as one. And blend -- ing with the saints we know, The build -- ing has be -- gun; We build to -- geth -- er and we build as one.</singingstanza>

  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Here we are gathered, one family in the Lord;
His life is the bond that we share.
Although we are many, we are in one accord,
And as the members, know the family care.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">And blending with the saints we know,
Our joy has just begun;
We blend together and we blend as one.
And blending with the saints we know,
The building has begun;
We build together and we build as one.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">When we're together our joy is made so full;
The love of the Lord fills our hearts,
And we all partake of the Spirit bountiful.
We've found, here in the family life, a part.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Here we will stay, Lord, according to Your plan,
For here in the church life we're one;
And we will be built up to be the corp'rate man
To consummate the New Jerusalem.</stanza>
