    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Lord, for this day, thankful to You,
I give myself to be joined to You anew.
You're the living water,
Satisfies me ever,
Fills my spirit, in me spreads, and
Floods me till life's fully manifest.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">No need for doubt or anxious care,
Just seek His kingdom and righteousness fore'er.
Daily needs compelling,
All to Him I'm telling,
And His peace, so rich and deep,
Preserves me safe and keeps me constantly.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Always rejoice, ceaselessly pray,
In all give thanks, 'tis the all-excelling way.
Christ's the living fountain,
My supply abundant,
All to His hand I entrust, and
He'll preserve and keep me to the end.</stanza>
