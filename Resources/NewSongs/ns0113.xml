    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Bless me, Lord, with days and nights
Of talks alone with Thee,
With hours and minutes, moments too
That I would thus know Thee.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Bless me with Thy presence sweet,
For I have naught but Thee;
Yea, nothing left but Thee Thyself,
Lord, give Thyself to me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Bless me with Thy shining light
And deal with every part.
That I would unreserved be
A channel of Thine heart.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Bless Thee, Lord, forevermore;
Come in these days between
'Til I one day I am as Thou art
And Morning Star be seen.</stanza>
