    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Lord, I do thank You for another day
To practice living You, in You to stay,
Lord, grant me the grace, Your life mine to replace
Two lives one, oh what a sweet embrace.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Lord, You are glory, You are beauty;
Divine and human woven utterly
Have mercy on me, that I may be
Joined to You, expressing You daily.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Lord, be my pattern, humble and lowly;
Save me from self and pride and vainglory.
Preserve and keep me, for Your economy,
Live in me, possess me wholly.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Lord, I do love You, operate in me,
Be my salvation, save me constantly
To hold forth Your word, life to others afford;
Shining You, so radiantly, dear Lord.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Lord, I'm so saturated with Your joy
That I am drunken, You as wine enjoy;
I'd pour out my being, as a drink offering
Upon You, God satisfying.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Lord, my desire is to be found in You
As lived out righteousness, give me this view.
Lord, clothe and stitch me, with embroidery
Day by day, inwrought Your gold in me.</stanza>
