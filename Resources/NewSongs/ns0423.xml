  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="">Of which I became a minister
According to the stewardship
Of God, which was given
To me for you,
To complete the word of God,
The mystery which has been hidden
From the ages and from the generations
But now has been manifested
To His saints;
To whom God willed to make known
What are the riches
Of the glory of this mystery
Among the Gentiles,
Which is Christ in you,
The hope of glory.</stanza>
