    <stanza type="verse" number="1">They walked along the road:
Two disciples, all alone,
Their Master dead and gone.
A man to them drew near,
Spoke to them and calmed their fears,
They told Him everything.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">
(He said:)
Why don't you believe?
For it was necessary
For the Christ to suffer all these things
And enter His glory.
Why don't you believe?
Why don't you believe?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">They came to journey's end;
He came in to eat with them,
He blessed and broke the bread.
Then opened were their eyes;
Jesus Christ they recognized.
He disappeared from them.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">(They said:)
Did not our hearts burn
As He spoke those words?
While we walked with Him
The Scriptures were opened.
Did not our hearts burn?
Did not our hearts burn?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">We walk along our road
He reminds us we were told
"I'm with you every day."
No matter how we feel,
He's the Spirit, He is real,
Indwelling you and me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">(We say:)
Do not our hearts burn
When we hear His word?
Jesus Christ, within,
In resurrection lives!
Do not our hearts burn?
Do not our hearts burn?</stanza>
