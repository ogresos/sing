    <stanza type="verse" number="1">One day as the Lord passed a well,
A woman so thirsty was there.
He was not content until
He left her the water that's real, pure, and clear.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Oh, come see a man,
Oh, come see a man,
Who told me all things that ever I did.
Is this not the Christ?
Is this not the Christ?
He fills me forever and ever! Amen.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">He spoke words that I'd never heard,
Yet how He did stir up my thirst!
He spoke of the water that lives,
To all who are thirsty, He freely will give.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Now this living water have I!
I drink and I soar to the sky!
His praises now fill all the air
Because I am speaking Him, now, everywhere!</stanza>
