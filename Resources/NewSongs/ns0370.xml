    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Do you know what you were saved for?
Do you ever wonder why?
What is God's intent and purpose?
Why has Christ become your life?</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Up till now we Christians only knew
Christ wants to get in you,
And that, indeed, is true;
Yet the vision goes much deeper still,
He has a plan He must fulfill.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Eden's river has a purpose,
Bringing life where'er it goes;
God's salvation, like a river,
Goes through stages as it flows.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">First we're saved from Satan's tyranny,
And later, we will see, from Christianity.
God is flowing in recovery,
Just open up to Him and see.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Not just individual Christians,
Isolated, wand'ring free,
But as stones built up together,
Christ expressing corporately.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">We were saved just Jesus to contain,
But there's a reason too,
That Christ came into you;
He came in, His purpose to secure,
To gain for Him a bride so pure.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Not the stones, though very precious,
Elevated "spiritually,"
But the stones built up together
In the Spirit, practically.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">You will ne'er be fully satisfied,
Or be content inside,
Till Jesus has His Bride.
Did you know the Lord is seeking you
To build into His building true?</stanza>
