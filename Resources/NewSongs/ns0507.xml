    <stanza type="verse" number="1">God's intention is to flow Himself into man.
He supplies our every need.
He is free, there's no demand.
Just open to the flow.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Can you see God's plan?
God Himself in man!
He is all we need!
Oh Lord keep me open unto Thee!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">I have come to You. I am thirsty; let me drink!
All the riches of this life
Flood in me, with joy I cry,
"I am no longer dry!"</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">You have come to us!
Now we come to drink!
We are filled with Christ
Drinking at the Fount of life am I!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Though I fail each day, I return to You and pray,
Asking Lord, "Unveil my face.
Keep me always in Your grace.
I drown without You Lord!"</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Though I fail each day,
I return and pray.
And I'm drawn to say
Lord make home in all my heart and stay!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">There is a river flowing from the throne
Reaching man in every place.
All our problems are erased.
We love You Jesus Lord!</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">God flows in me
He will never leave.
I am now set free!
I am satisfied eternally!</stanza>
