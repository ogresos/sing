  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">How glorious is Thy church, Oh Lord&amp;mdash;
No trace of sin in her.
What myst'ry this: God died as man,
For, oh, He loves her so!</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Glorious, Glorious church,
She is Thy dear Bride;
She was built from Thine own side;
She is the same as Thee.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">How precious is Thy Body, Lord;
How costly in Thy sight.
I'd ne'er bring anything of self,
For she is out from Thee.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">How faithful is Thyself, dear Lord&amp;mdash;
Eternally the same.
Though man may fail to reach Thy will,
Thou shalt obtain Thy Bride.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">How subtle is my self, Oh Lord;
Yet I wilt be transformed.
Through Spirit's work&amp;mdash;become a stone
To build up Thine own Bride.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">How precious is Thy Body, Lord;
How costly in my sight.
I would decrease, and Thee increase
At any cost for her.</stanza>
