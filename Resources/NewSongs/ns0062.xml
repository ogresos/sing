    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Oh, there's a place for you, my friend
Where the earthly sorrows end,
And the joy is flowing like a river, free;
Where everyone is satisfied,
As we mutually abide
In the One who gave His life for you and me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Oh, Jesus is blending us together;
He is the reason why we're here.
We will be one in Him forever,
And we will build according to this vision clear.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">If you would like to know this place
Where you'll find abundant grace,
All that I can say is that you'll have to "see."
'Cause words come short of the appeal&amp;mdash;
I just know that it is real&amp;mdash;
Once you've seen it too, I think that you'll agree!</stanza>
