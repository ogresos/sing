    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Oh how sweet it is just to know my Christ!
Knowing Him's the goal of my whole life.
Gaining Him supplies me, day by day,
He's rich, He's excellent in every way.
I'm fully captured by Him, my All in all,
He fills my heart with faith to love Him when I call.
Every day He grows more as faith in me
As I dwell one with Him organically.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">As a stream of love, how His life flows in!
Motivating us to just love Him.
So we give ourselves; Lord, do grow in us
May we know You in Your preciousness.
O Lord, do make us one as we run toward You,
Pursuing corporately in everything we do
With the saints until full maturity
As Your loving counterpart eternally.</stanza>
