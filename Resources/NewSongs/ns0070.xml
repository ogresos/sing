    <stanza type="verse" number="1">I will not let Thee go, my Lord,
I will not let Thee go!
Confession glad on Thee outpoured,
Thine own dear heart to know.
My heart desires, my lips request
To be of use to Thee,
That in that day I'd share Your rest
Through serving faithfully.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">And days ahead I shall not fear
I trust Thy sovereign Hand!
So all creation bend and hear
This cry!  My joyful stand!
No longer days of sad neglect
Now shall affront my view
Nor sorrowed nights of deep regret
I'll waste apart from You.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Ambition shall no longer keep,
Unyielding grip on me.
While true 'tis pride's veins do run deep
They're severed Lord in Thee
It was with joy that Caleb stood
'Hind Joshua on that day.
And glory comes to all who would
Now enter Caleb's way.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Though not through my own efforts vain
Could I e'er make You glad
But through apostles' teaching gain
The view such brothers had.
And through their practice enter in
My crown in hand that day.
And joy with Your apostles then
Not having turned away.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">My heart, my soul, I have resigned
Drink off'ring for Your joy.
Imagination  ne'er could find
Or want greater employ!
I will not let Thee go my Lord,
I will not let Thee go!
Confession glad on Thee outpoured,
Thine own dear heart to know.</stanza>
