    <stanza type="verse" number="1">My inner parts have yearned for Him;
To my Beloved I now open;
My Beloved's gone, He has withdrawn,
I open but He was gone.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">I am sick with love, I am sick with love for Him.
If you find Him, please tell Him that
I am sick with love for Him.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">I sought Him but I found Him not.
I called Him yet He answered not.
If you find my love please tell Him that
I'm sick with love for Him.</stanza>
