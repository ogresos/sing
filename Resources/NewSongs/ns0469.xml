    <stanza type="verse" number="1">One thing every heart desireth
As it probes in vanity,
Groping for its life's true meaning,
Longing for reality.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Hid in every aspiration,
In whate'er man doth contrive,
Is the longing for fulfillment;
For this man doth ever strive.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">For with nothing here to live for,
How long could man be sustained?
Thus within the old creation
Man's existence is maintained.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">For this, old creation's needed:
It's the bridge of space and time,
Till God brings forth new creation,
His eternal realm sublime.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">This implanted sense of purpose
Sown within the heart of man;
Working throughout all the ages,
Is for God's eternal plan.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Deep in man's a God-shaped vacuum,
Something only God can fill,
There's a human spirit longing
To know God's eternal will.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">All things are but temporary;
Vanity of vanities
But th'eternal life assuageth
Thirsty sinners who believe.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">Though the nations think they're seeking
Joy, peace, love, security,
Christ alone can fill their longing,
As the one reality.</stanza>
