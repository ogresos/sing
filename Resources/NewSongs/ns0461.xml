For your love is better than wine.
Your name is like ointment poured forth;
Therefore the virgins love you.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="">The king brought me, brought me into his chambers&amp;mdash;
We'll be glad and joy in you;
We'll extol your love much more than wine.
Draw me; we will run after you.</stanza>

Where do you feed your flock?
Where do they lie down at noon?
Where do you pasture your flock?</stanza>

Go by the flock's footsteps,
Feed your young, O fairest one,
By the shepherds' tents.</stanza>
