    <stanza type="verse" number="1">I was drawn to the world and it's sin,
I was seeking but empty within;
Then this man crossed my path,
And instead of God's wrath
He loved me and opened God's heart!
Jesus loves me and waters my heart.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">He drew me with cords of a man,
With bands of love;
Christ's coming His living, His dying,
His rising far above,
Descending... like a dove;
Reaching me, even me,
With God's love.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">I was seeking the world and it's things,
I was wealthy and yet could not see
It was Christ I desired,
Of the world I was tired,
He loved me and came to my house!
Jesus loves me and saves all my house!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">I was happy with friends, all my mates,
With my music, wild parties and dates;
Yet when Christ came to call,
I have gladly left all!
He loved me and He gave His all!
Jesus loves me, I answer His call!</stanza>
