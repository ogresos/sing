    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Enter into the enjoyment
Experience the Lord
He's the rich supply
Don't let a day go by
Without the presence of the Lord!
We don't care about the tree of knowledge
Good and evil kill us dead.
We don't need to behave ourselves into the grave
Just touch the living Lord instead.</stanza>
