    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Fallen, in her condition
Israel left her Love.
She was stubborn in her position&amp;mdash;
To God she would not come.
Under the Lord's chastising
She was an unturned cake.
But Jehovah, with love unchanging
Makes Israel His own son&amp;mdash;a change to make.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">You became a man&amp;mdash;
Cord of love to me.
I am drawn with loving bands
And embraced by Thee.
From the heavens came,
You stepped out of eternity,
Died and rose as a man
That You could impart Your life to me.</stanza>
