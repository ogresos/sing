    <stanza type="verse" number="">Let us rejoice and exult,
And let us give glory to Him,
For the marriage of the Lamb has come,
And His wife has made herself,
Made herself ready.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="">And it was given her that
She should be clothed in fine linen,
Bright and clean;
For the fine linen is
The righteousnesses of the saints,
     of the saints.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="">And he said to me, Write,
Blessed are they who are called,
Called to the marriage dinner of the Lamb.
And he said to me,
These are the true words of God.
And he said to me,
These are the true words of God.</stanza>
