  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Christ's divinity's glorious indeed;
'Twas concealed in Him as in a grain of wheat.
While incarnated, He was pressed, constrained
For the release of His glory within.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Incorporation! Incorporation&amp;mdash;
The issue of Christ's glorification.
In our daily walk, we must join to Him
And must live in Him, and work as one with Him.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Christ was glorified, dying on the cross;
Glory was released&amp;mdash;this was not a loss!
Spirit He became, for life-giving;
Last Adam is He, for His dispensing.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Resurrected, Christ thus was born to be
God's firstborn Son with humanity.
Many sons were through resurrection, born;
The Lord Spirit, Christ, their being will transform.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">We in faith were regenerated;
God and man thus incorporated.
This took place through Christ's resurrection.
For His divine, glorious multiplication.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Three aspects of incorporation:
Father's house for His satisfaction,
The true vine for His multiplication,
Child of the Spirit, for His move on earth.</stanza>
