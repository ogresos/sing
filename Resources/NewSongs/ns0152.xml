  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">O Lord, You have from days of eternity
Desired to be expressed through man corporately.
As one whom You've chosen to share in Your plan,
I'm being constituted to impart You to man.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Lord, I fully consecrate myself to be
A normal Christian in Your economy.
I would live solely with the Body in view,
Fulfilling my stewardship&amp;mdash;"to me for you."</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">In Christ as Spirit You dispense all to me,
Making me a steward in Your economy.
Ever faithful to the measure I have received
To impart You to others, life conceived.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Lord, I give You ground to make Your home in my heart.
Settle down and strengthen every inward part.
The unlimited Christ experienced by me,
To others I minister for Your glory.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">In fellowship with You, my spirit employ,
Your unsearchable riches I would enjoy.
Not confine them within, myself to gild,
But with others share them, Your Body to build.</stanza>
