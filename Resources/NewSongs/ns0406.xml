    <stanza type="verse" number="">But God commends His own love to us
In that while we were yet sinners,
Christ died for us.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="">Much more then, having been justified now
In His blood, we shall be saved
Through Him from the wrath.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="">For if, while we were enemies,
We were reconciled to God,
To God through the death of His Son,
Much more, much more,
Having been reconciled,
We shall be saved in His life.
We shall be saved in His life.</stanza>
