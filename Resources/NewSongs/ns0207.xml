  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Every new day's a new start.
Lord, again we're coming to You.
Lord, could You ever break through within us
If, Lord, we gave You a part?</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">O Lord, we can't do it on our own.
O Lord Jesus, how we need You!
Win us, woo us, to Thyself, Lord,
That we'd ever stay, Lord, with You.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Lord, before time had begun,
We were marked and called out by You.
We had no choice, we were trapped by You, Lord;
We had no place we could run.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Some of my friends are so free.
Who could I blame, Lord, but Thee?
I cannot do all the things that they do
Because You set me apart.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Lord, I'm realizing that
Loving You's a tender trap.
Since You have kissed me, my heart has melted;
All my resistance has cracked.</stanza>
