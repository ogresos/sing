    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Begin the day with God, He really wants you to
Hoping you'll let Him come and spend the day with you.
Rise up! Don't wait! You'll miss the Son.
It's the best part of the day.
His taste is sweet, to all who meet
Him in the morning when He's fresh and new.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Begin the day with God, He's waiting there for you.
Morning by morning come, His mercy is brand new.
Rise up! Don't wait! You'll miss the Son.
He has so much for you.
Enjoy your portion and your part
Until the Morning Star rises in your heart.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Begin the day with God, He needs His people to
Be those who love Him best! Get up with this in view.
Rise up! Don't wait! You'll miss the Son.
He needs some to watch and pray.
Spend time with Him and let Him in&amp;mdash;
To your heart so He can have His way.</stanza>
