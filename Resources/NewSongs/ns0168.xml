  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">From the time I spoke Your name,
Lord, my life's not been the same
Since I called on the only One who'd save me.
When forsaken, in despair&amp;mdash;
Who'd have thought that You'd be there!
Now I've found out, Jesus, You're alive!</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Now my eyes begin to see
I'm living as I ought to be,
As this turning, burning God
moves in my heart...
I don't care now how I feel;
I just know that this is real,
And I know, oh Jesus, You're alive!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">All my friends might think it's square&amp;mdash;
Since I touched You, I don't care&amp;mdash;
For I've found You're the only life worth living.
Though some mock and criticize,
Lord, they just don't realize
That I've found out, Jesus, You're alive!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">It's no statue that I call,
Not a picture on the wall,
But a person who lives His life within me.
Wish they'd told me long before,
All You want's an open door
And that really, Jesus, You're alive!</stanza>
