  <lyrics>
    <!--stanza type="verse" number="1">Lord Jesus, all our hearts You've gained,
You are the only One we love.
Lord, keep our hearts single and pure
To love You and Your church.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Increase Yourself, O Lord,
Now in us, grow more and more.
And build the glorious church,
You love and have died for.
Lord, we suffer and live to You,
'Tis our glory and joy.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Lord Jesus, we are Your increase,
The church, the kingdom, now we see;
Lord, may we in Your kingdom live,
Fighting for Your interest.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">May Your recovery,
Forward march, spread far and wide.
May Your lampstands shine forth,
In each city so bright.
We fear not hardship nor evil,
For Lord You stand with us.</stanza-->
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Our hearts, Lord, now You fully own,
We love You, Lord, and You alone.
Lord, single keep our hearts, and pure,
For You and for Your church.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Increase Yourself, O Lord,
Now in us, grow more and more.
Oh, build Your glorious church&amp;mdash;
You loved and died for her!
To suffer, Lord, and live to You,
Our joy, our glory true.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Lord Jesus, we are Your increase,
The church, the kingdom, now we see;
Lord, may we in Your kingdom live,
For Your economy.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">May Your recovery,
Forward march, spread far and wide.
Your lampstands shining forth
In every city bright.
Nor ill nor hardship do we fear,
For Lord, You stand beside.</stanza>
