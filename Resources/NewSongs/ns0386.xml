  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">When we believe into the Son,
By His Spirit, we are made one;
When we believe into the Son,
By His Spirit, we are made one.

Brothers: We are one.
Sisters: We are all made one.
Brothers: We are one.
Sisters: We are all made one.
Brothers: We are one.
Sisters: We are all made one.
Everyone: We are one.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">The world is longing, seeking for peace,
Yet wars and rumors of wars still increase.
There is no way for men to end all this fear,
All this pain, all this hate, all these tears,
Yet Jesus is here!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">We are dwelling in the love of the Lord,
He our unity has now restored.
Brothers, sisters in one family,
As the Father and the Son, always one,
So are we!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">How good and pleasant it can be
When brothers dwell in unity;
Like sweet anointing and the mountain dew;
Life eternal for me and for you&amp;mdash;
All things are new!</stanza>
