    <stanza type="verse" number="1">God is processed, this I know,
For the Bible tells me so.
Incarnated as a man,
Lived and died and raised again.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Yes, God is processed,
Now He's the Spirit
To constitute us
With the processed Triune God.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Incarnation: mingled makes,
Crucifixion: terminates,
Resurrection: germinates,
Life divine now animates.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Incarnated so He can
Have the living of a man.
Crucified and raised that He
Could impart His life to me.</stanza>
