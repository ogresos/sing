    <stanza type="verse" number="1">I just existed empty, not knowing
what life was for;
Until one day someone told me that
there was something more;
At first I wouldn't take it&amp;mdash;
it seemed too simple to me!</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Calling His name, "O Lord Jesus!"
Saying, "Amen," when He speaks.
Filling my spirit with His life.
Filling my whole life with His life.
Flooding my living with His life.
Filling my whole life with His life!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">But then at length I tried it&amp;mdash;
first softly, to myself.
As I called I felt like someone sick
brought back to health.
The flow of life within me, I'd never
felt before.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Then as I called on Jesus I felt
that I'd been found!
I was so full; I was calling "Jesus!"
right out loud.
I'd never dreamed that I could know
reality by...</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">And now I'm full and happy, so
satisfied with Him,
Because He has come and filled me
clear up past the brim.
His life is now my portion&amp;mdash;
I'll go on all my life, just...</stanza>
