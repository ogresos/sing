    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Have you seen God's salvation?
Do you feel His provision?
Have you won the victory o'er the flesh?
Have you entered the kingdom of God?</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Have you climbed the mountain?
Are you in the light?
Have you changed your diet?
Are you eating Christ?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Do you long for His presence?
Do you know His intention
Is to make us just the same as He?
And to love Him constantly?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Will you be a loving seeker?
Not a poor, dead law keeper?
We can read His word day by day,
Infuse us Lord, we pray.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Are you in His recovery?
Do you know the highest story
Is the mingling of both God and man
To fulfill His eternal plan?</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">We have climbed the mountain,
We are in the light,
We have changed our diet,
We are eating Christ!</stanza>
    <stanza type="note" number="">(Repeat the last line of each verse)</stanza>
