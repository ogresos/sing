    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Lord, You have searched me and You have known me.
You understand my thoughts from afar!
You comprehend my path and are acquainted with all my ways,
For there is not a word on my tongue,
But behold You know it all together!</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Search me, O God, and know my heart;
Try me and know my anxieties;
See if there is any wicked in me,
And lead me in the way everlasting!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Lord, You have touched me and You have shown me
That I am not so simple as I thought.
I often run and hide, prone to an errant heart.
But there is not a pause and You pursue!
And behold You've caught me altogether!</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Where can I go from Your Spirit, O Lord?
I can't flee from Your presence, You're inside me.
I've climbed the steep mountains, but You still are there,
Descend to the valleys but You find me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Now I see, there's something more to this pattern:
You want to show me all that You are.
So You've drawn me from this strife, into the family life.
As one, our prayers can match Your deep desires.
Now behold we follow You together!</stanza>
