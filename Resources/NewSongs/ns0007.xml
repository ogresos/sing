    <stanza type="verse" number="1">O Father God, how faithful You
Are through eternity;
For Your eternal purpose You
Are faithful now in me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">How stedfast is Thy faithfulness!
For this I worship Thee;
It is established in the heav'n,
And ever stands for me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">You've called us into fellowship
Of Your dear Son, our Lord,
That He may be our portion full,
Our center, our accord.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Though we unfaithful oft will be,
Yet You are faithful still,
Though not for human welfare but
For Your eternal will.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Since we've believed into Your Son
Some losses You've allowed
That we from broken cisterns turn 
To drink our Fountain-God.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Your faithfulness has led us in
To Your economy,
Where Christ we all enjoy that You
In us may increased be.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">The living water's faithful flow
We drink and shout, Amen;
The destination of this flow
The New Jerusalem.</stanza>
