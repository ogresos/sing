  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Our flesh, which is with us the rest of our lives
Needs to be dealt with, exposed, recognized.
It's only by eating our Christ every day;
A little each morning, oh this is God's way!</stanza>
    <stanza type="stanza" number="">What is it? Manna!
Christ as our food!
Oh change our diet!
Reconstitute us!
What is it? Manna!
Christ as our food!
Oh change our diet!
Reconstitute.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">The heavenly diet fulfills God's great plan
Because it supplies and reconstitutes man
To build up the church, His unique dwelling place.
For this heavenly manna, Lord give us the taste!</stanza>
