    <stanza type="verse" number="1">I live and yet not I,
For Christ He lives in me.
The life I live in the flesh now
Is Christ, just Christ, to be.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">O what a marvelous hope, Lord,
To find myself in You,
And in experience my boasting,
To know You through and through.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">O what a wondrous existence,
Of all which is most blessed.
You see, Lord, I am now softened
To take from You what's best.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">It's not my fervent resolve, Lord,
Nor e'en my love untrue.
It's You in me Who is doing,
What I for You couldn't do.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">From every other attraction&amp;mdash;
Be faithful, break me free.
Though smarting, Lord, from Love's action,
Each wound draws me to Thee.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">You see each end from beginning;
Take me through each dark phase;
As long, Lord, as love conforms me,
Fits me to meet You that day.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">So here we are, dear Lord Jesus,
And may Your precious hand,
Accomplish all that You've purposed,
All that You've for us planned.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">You are our one destination,
You are our destiny.
These days, just for our preparing,
Will leave what in memory?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">In us, Lord, gain all You're after,
In us, Lord, gain Your Bride.
In us, be so very blessed.
In us, be satisfied.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">As we, Lord, become Your fullness
And You in us reside,
Keep us, dear Lord, in Your love-bonds,
As mutually we abide.</stanza>
