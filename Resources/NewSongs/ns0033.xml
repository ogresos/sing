  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">If there's such love in the human race,
To meet all our need with wondrous grace,
Firm and endless and free,
Like the high mount and sea,
Our dear Lord need not a human be;
In the dark, He has heard,
How I sigh, how I pine,
On the way, He has seen,
How I wander in life.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">In His love to us He has drawn nigh,
Coming to us from His throne on high.
Seeking me without rest,
Thirst and hunger did taste,
On the cross the Lord paid all my debt,
He arose from the grave,
All the sinners He saved,
Joined with me, He filled me with His faith.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Love I've found within the human race,
Of all love in heav'n and earth the best,
Firm and endless and free,
Like the high mount and sea,
True and precious, through eternity;
He's with me all my days,
Leading me all the way;
O my Lord, O my love,
"I love You!" 'Tis my prayer.</stanza>
