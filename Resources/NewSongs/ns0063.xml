  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Christ is God incarnated,
Born according to God's plan
To bring divinity, into humanity,
By mingling with man.

Christ is God incarnated,
He became the Son of Man;
A man of flesh yet without sin,
Accomplishing redemption,
He was a perfect man.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">And He shall be named Jesus,
And called Emmanuel,
Hallelujah! God with us,
In man He came to dwell.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Christ is God incarnated,
How wonderful! How marvellous!
Incarnated so that He could
Live inside of you and me,
He's mingling now with us.

Christ is God incarnated,
He became the first God-man.
Oh! How glorious!
Now He lives inside of us,
Fulfilling God's great plan.</stanza>
