    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Lord Jesus Christ, I do love You
Because You first loved me.
You shed Your blood, were crucified,
While hanging on a tree.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">In resurrection and through death,
You mingled God with man&amp;mdash;
Produced Your Body, consummating
The New Jerusalem.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">For You Lord, open my heart wide.
With others build me up.
In You we would together blend,
Enjoy Salvation's cup.</stanza>
