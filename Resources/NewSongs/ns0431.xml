    <stanza type="verse" number="">And as for you,
The anointing which you have received
From Him abides in you, and you have no need
That anyone teach you;
But as His anointing teaches you
Concerning all things and is true
And is not a lie,
And even as it has taught you,
Abide in Him,
Abide in Him.</stanza>
