    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Our Christ He is the fruit of earth,
In excellence replete;
Jehovah's shoot, divinity;
Where God with man does meet.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Our Christ He is the canopy
To shelter God's elect,
A hiding place, a shade from heat,
God's work He does protect.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">As virgin's Son, to us He came&amp;mdash;
The universal sign;
Immanuel, God dwells with us;
O what a joy divine.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Now unto us this child is born,
As firstborn Son He came;
As counselor, He's wonderful,
The mighty God His name.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">The shadow of a massive rock
Upon a wasted soil,
A refuge He from storm and wind,
A rest from earthly toil.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">A twig and branch and Jesse's root,
The fruit of all the earth;
He grew up as a tender plant,
O what a Christ of worth.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Our Christ, He is the cornerstone;
He's tested and secure,
The glory of the Father's house,
Upon Him resting sure.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">Although He was despised by man,
Acquainted He with grief;
He paid the greatest sacrifice
That we should find release.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="9">A peg that's driven in the wall
On which all glory rests,
The faithful household steward He,
God's wisdom manifest.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="10">Eternal covenant He makes
With David's mercies sure;
The thirsty He does satisfy
With living waters pure.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="11">To properly portray this One,
The Bible uses three:
Isaiah, Cyrus, Israel;
A threefold Servant He.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="12">The Prince of Peace and Mighty God,
The Savior and the King,
The light in the Millennium,
'Tis of this One we sing.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="13">Since unto us this light has shined,
Who dwell in Galilee,
We evermore declare His praise,
O what a Christ is He.</stanza>
