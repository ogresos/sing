    <stanza type="verse" number="1">What things were gains to me,
These I now count as loss.
Jesus has set me free
From what I was!
All of the things I had;
Everything, good or bad,
I count as refuse
That I may gain Christ!</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">I won't give up!
I will keep running until
I have attained
The goal of my calling!
I must press on!
I must pursue until
I lay hold of Him
Who laid hold of me!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Forget the things behind!
Stretch for the things before!
Press onward with this mind:
Always want more!
Seeking in Him to grow,
Increasingly to know
Him that I daily might
Be found in Christ.</stanza>
