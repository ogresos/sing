  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Lord Jesus, draw me one step further;
Draw me, Lord from where I am.
I've been here too long already.
Move me, Lord, I know You can.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Your whisper, Lord, so softly sounding,
Deep within my heart does burn.
Let Your stillness now subdue me
That Your feeling I discern.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">All idle thoughts and impure feelings,
Lord, remove from mind and heart.
Wash me in the crystal water
And more life to me impart.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">All hidden things that block my vision,
Rocks of self-ambition, pride;
Now expose and burn away, Lord
By Your look intensified.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Increase the weight of glory in me,
Let Your Spirit now transform,
That all things would not be wasted
But would work to save me more.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Lord Jesus, oh how much I need You!
Thank You, Lord, that You are here,
Ever present as the Body.
I would always seek You there.</stanza>
