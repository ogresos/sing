    <stanza type="verse" number="1">I'm a sinner without one plea,
But the Lamb of God in me;
I was lost and without hope
But my Savior came and sought me out.
'Tis my story and my song;
To the world I say so long;
I now walk and live in light
With the New Jerusalem in sight.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Till the end of days,
He will be with me
And lead me to that place;
I give my all:
My life, my ways, my thoughts,
And everything to Him, my love.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Sometimes I think that I might leave
And wallow in misery,
But then graciously He comes
And applies His gentle, soothing touch.
'Tis my story and my fight;
To the self I say goodbye;
I now walk and live in light
With the coming kingdom full in sight.</stanza>
