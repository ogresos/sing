    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Buried? Yes, but it is seed
From which Continents may feed;
Millions yet may bless the day
When that seed was laid away.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Buried! hidden! out of sight!
Dwelling in the deepest night;
Losing, underneath the sod,
Everything, except its God.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Buried, unremember'd, lost
So thinks man: but all the cost
God has counted to display
Life abundant one glad day.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Art thou buried? God's pure seed
Doth thy heart in silence bleed?
Change thy sighing into song,
Thus alone can harvests come.</stanza>
