We need to love the Lord And keep His pure Word, And wear Christ as our clothes; We need to call His name, In Him re -- main, In Him, our soul -- life lose.</singingstanza>

    <stanza type="chorus" number="">We can eat, we can drink,
We can enjoy God,
By loving His priceless presence;
We can eat, we can drink,
We can enjoy God
By calling His precious name.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">We need to love the Lord
And keep His pure Word,
And wear Christ as our clothes;
We need to call His name,
In Him remain,
In Him, our soul-life lose.</stanza>
    <stanza type="note">(Chorus)</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">We need to eat the Lord,
Absorb His pure Word
And breathe in Christ as life;
And as we breathe God in,
The Spirit begins
Dispensing the life supply.</stanza>
