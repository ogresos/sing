    <stanza type="chorus" number="">The love of Christ is Christ Himself.
Just as Christ is immeasurable,
So also is His love;
Hence, it is knowledge surpassing.
Yet we can know it by experiencing it.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">When Christ makes His home in our hearts,
And when we are full of strength to apprehend
With all the saints the dimensions of Christ
And to know by experience His knowledge surpassing love,
We will be filled unto all the fullness of God,
Which is the church, the corporate expression of God
For the fulfillment of His intention.</stanza>
