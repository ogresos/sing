    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Thank You, Lord Jesus, for dying for me.
It's Your precious blood cleansing all iniquities.
It's there on the cross where You bled and died for me.
Lord Jesus, I thank You, I'm fully justified in Thee.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Lord Jesus, I love You,
You're precious to me.
It's here in Your presence,
I've seen Your beauty.
You're matchless, You're priceless,
You're everything to me.
I'll love You forever&amp;mdash;
You are the only One for me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Daily I come to be supplied by Your word.
It's by this supply that I'm richly satisfied.
It's here that I'm strengthened to live the Christian life.
It's nothing I do, but Your overflowing grace to me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Each day as I wake up I come to You, Lord.
Our fellowship sweet must be daily restored.
Void of offense, keep my conscience so pure.
Soften me, Lord, so that You alone may have my heart.</stanza>
