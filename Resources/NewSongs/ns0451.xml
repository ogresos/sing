    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Lord, deeper make Thy home in me
'Til ev'ry room belong to Thee,
That Thou might fully make me Thee
And so full rest Thou have in me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">So also deeper into Thee
I'd make my home, my rest in Thee;
A pillar in Thy temple be
And stay in Thee eternally.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Thy precious blood was shed that we
Could closer, closer, closest be;
In resurrection brought to Thee
That we might be as one as Thee.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">My lovely Lord, my dear Bridegroom,
In trust I open ev'ry room;
This mind, emotion, will be Thine;
When Thou hast rest, that rest is mine.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Oh mystery of mysteries&amp;mdash;
Lord, Thou in me and I in Thee!
The church, Thy tabernacle, we;
Our temple, Thou eternally.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Lord, make Thy home more ev'ry day,
'Til one with Thee in ev'ry way,
'Til on me write Thy holy name,
'Til on me write Thy city's name.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Lord, Thou art me and I am Thee,
As lovers coinhering, we;
Soon then shall come eternity
When God and man dwell mutually.</stanza>
