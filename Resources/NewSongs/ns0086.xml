    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Come, all ye saints, and sing with me.
His love and joy have set me free.
The greatest Savior ever, He!
Come praise and sing in Jubilee!</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">He changed my life with one simple call.
He gained my heart to love Him o'er all.
And now I will praise Him, and tell the whole world.
I love my Jesus forevermore!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Our Lord has been anointed for
Announcing good news to the poor,
Release to captives&amp;mdash;ye much more&amp;mdash;
The blind, their sight He has restored.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">You, Lord, have sent away, released,
Those once oppressed, whose bondage ceased.
You have proclaimed today to be
God's promised year of Jubilee.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Lord, You have now fulfilled God's Word;
Your proclamation we have heard.
We join with You, our hearts You've stirred;
God's kingdom's here, the age has turned.</stanza>
