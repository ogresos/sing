    <stanza type="verse" number="1">It's so easy to love the Lord.
It's so easy to love the Lord.
It's so easy to love the Lord.
It's so easy to love the Lord.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">It's so easy, it's so easy&amp;mdash;Amen.
It's so easy, it's so easy&amp;mdash;love Him.
It's so easy, it's so easy&amp;mdash;Amen.
It's so easy, it's so easy&amp;mdash;love Him.
It's so easy to love the Lord.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">When we call on Him we see,
Just how beautiful is He.
Just one look&amp;mdash;it is enough,
For us all to fall in love.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Nothing else I need to do,
Just to "stop" and look anew.
Swells my heart with love divine,
When His Spirit flows in mine.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">There's no need to dwell on sin,
In His blood we've entered in.
Now in spirit we are free,
To enjoy reality!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Crazy love is filling me!
I don't care what I will be!
Only one thing matters still,
Lord e'en more my spirit fill!</stanza>
