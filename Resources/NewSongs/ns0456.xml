    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Lord Jesus Christ my sole desire,
My heart is fixed, alone, on Thee.
Among ten thousand Thou art peerless;
Chiefest of all art Thou to me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Thy matchlessness and worth surpassing,
Transcend all else exceedingly.
Oh, how supreme and prepossessing,
Is Thine unrivaled love to me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">My life-long quest is just to know Thee
Till more and more subjectively,
I would arrive at the full knowledge,
Of all the excellence of Thee.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Since the first day that I beheld Thee
I've longed to know Thee ever more
My heart doth love Thee most supremely
Thy preciousness, Lord, I adore.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Lost in Thee, Lord, I gaze intently
Drawn from all else to look away,
Thou, Magnet of my soul, hast charmed me
Far more today than yesterday.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">I'm captivated by Thy beauty,
Incomp'rable Thou art to me.
Counting all things as loss and refuse,
I'd pay the price of gaining Thee.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">My daily goal and aimâ€”to win Thee,
For this I press on desperately,
Forgetting all that is behind me
And stretching forward earnestly.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">Toward this goal I'm pressing onward
That I may lay hold of the Prize,
Gain me in full that I may gain Thee
Thy peerlessness to realize.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="9">Not I alone; we in the Body
Strive to delve into and explore
The rich dimensions of Thy vastness,
Thine endless wealth and treasure store.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="10">When Thou, our Christ, so all-inclusive,
We apprehend, know, and possess
Thine attributes divine, our virtues
Will all Thy fullness thus express.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="11">Thine excellency may we know, Lord,
That Thou, Thy home in us, may make
Till we arrive at Thy full knowledge
And, of Thy riches full, partake.</stanza>
