    <stanza type="verse" number="1">I once was dead&amp;mdash;dead in my sins;
Behaved myself in lust of flesh.
By nature such a child of wrath,
Even as the rest.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">But God being so merciful
Because of His great love to me
Enlivened me I'm now in Christ
Seated in the heavenlies.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">But that's not all! I'm with the saints.
Together we're His workmanship,
His masterpiece expressing Him
In the heavens and on earth.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">I was once apart from Christ, you know;
Alien from the wealth of Israel;
Not a hope&amp;mdash;not even one to tell,
Without God in the world.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Now in Christ He has become my peace;
By the blood of Christ I am released.
I am one with all the saints, since He's
Broken down the middle wall.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">He has died creating one new man.
Thus fulfilling God's eternal plan.
With all saints together, let us stand,
Shout and sing and praise the Lord!</stanza>
