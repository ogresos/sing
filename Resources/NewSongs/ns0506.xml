  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Noah's life was one that surely changed the age,
When he found the grace of God;
He was not afraid to stand against the world,
So he built the ark of wood.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Would you choose to be a living overcomer,
Be a person not ashamed to be a Jesus lover,
One who eats the tree of life,
And drinks the living water?
Would you choose to be a living overcomer,
To leave the world and consecrate
To be today's age-turner?
I give myself to You for Your return.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Moses was a person who was called by God,
He was meant to turn the age;
He was God's companion, he was for God's move,
He was faithful, meek, and sage.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Samuel ministered to be a God-pleasing priest,
He was absolute for Him;
Samuel gave himself to be a Nazarite,
Saved from death, the world, and sin.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Daniel had companions, and they ate God's Word,
From the world, they stood apart;
Through a praying spirit were aligned with God,
For His people, God's own heart.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">I will choose to be a living overcomer,
Be a person not ashamed to be a Jesus lover,
One who eats the tree of life,
And drinks the living water.
I will give myself to be an overcomer,
To see a heav'nly vision,
Keep my flaming spirit burning!
I give myself to You, to turn this age.</stanza>
