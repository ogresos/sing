  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">To live a life
In the Holy of Holies
We must become a captive of Christ.
Many times, reality is that
Christ is captive to us,
This becomes our own fleshly
Victory.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Conquer me,
Subdue me,
That I'd no longer be Your enemy.
Defeat me at any cost
That my own will would be lost.
Your desires make my own.
Never let me win.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">I'm willing,
Defeat me.
Put the world and sins beneath my feet.
Within me is rebellion.
Defeat it, conquer and subdue it.
Carry me away as Your captive.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Today	
There's a need
For us to become captives.	
We will see 		
The affect on those around us.
So become a little captive,
A living sacrifice,	
In the triumph of Christ.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">But thanks be to God
Who always leads us
In the triumph
In the Christ.</stanza>
