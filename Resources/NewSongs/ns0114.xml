  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Nothing's quite so precious
As Jesus in my spirit.
He takes away the care
And fills me with His peace.
He never leaves me,
E'en as the days grow weary.
His presence goes with me.
My soul delights to hide in His arms.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">I call His name, "Lord Jesus,
Help me in my weakness."
So faithfully each day in me
He proves His life is so sufficient.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Nothing's quite so precious
As Jesus in my spirit.
He turns my heart to Him,
To feast upon His life.
It's nothing I do&amp;mdash;
His mercy's just upon me.
And God's free gift of grace
Becomes an endless joy to me.</stanza>
