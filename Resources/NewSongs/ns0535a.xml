    <stanza type="verse" number="1">The altar of burnt offering
In God's economy,
Is Christ, the bronzed acacia wood,
Judged in humanity.
The altar of burnt offering
The cross of Christ displays,
One person&amp;mdash;Christ; one way&amp;mdash;the cross&amp;mdash;
Encompass all God's ways.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">The altar of burnt offering's
Where precious blood was shed;
The blood of Jesus is our plea
As forward we are led.
The altar of burnt offering
Is meeting God's demand,
God's righteousness and holiness
Are our eternal stand.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Come forward to the Holiest;
With God, in oneness, pray;
The precious blood's applied again,
God's economic way.
Anointing oil applied upon
Both altars clearly shows:
The move of God's eternal grace
Between two altars flows.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">The fire from heaven, which came down
To burn the offered Son,
Becomes the fire to incense burn,
As fragrance to God's throne;
The sweetness we experience
Through Christ's inclusive death,
Is sweetness unto God through our
Ascending, praying breath.</stanza>
