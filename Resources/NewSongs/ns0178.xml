  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Born of my father, descended from Adam,
A life in my flesh is God's enemy.
I have inherited God's condemnation,
Death and sin were reigning in me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">But love eternal appeared and He called me,
Out from the lost and hopeless race.
Into His Son now I have been transferred,
Born of the Spirit, into His grace.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">I am God's child now, free to enjoy Him.
The Spirit of Life is reigning in me.
Christ is my walking, my living, my breathing,
All that I have and ever will be.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Chosen and guided into His purpose,
From individual to corporate man.
Now in His Body, we can experience
All the unlimited grace of His plan.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">This is the mystery hidden from ages.
For this God brought us from sinner to son.
Practical church life, daily transforming
Into the oneness, God's expression.</stanza>
