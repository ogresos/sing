    <singingstanza>I've found the One who's all to me; He's be -- come re -- al -- i -- ty. Now He's in my life to stay; He is the truth, the life, the way. And Je -- sus is the One who came Down to earth to bear our shame, But that's not all, He lives in me. Once I was blind, but now I see.</singingstanza>

  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">I've found the One who's all to me;
He's become reality.
Now He's in my life to stay;
He is the truth, the life, the way.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">And Jesus is the One who came
Down to earth to bear our shame,
But that's not all, He lives in me.
Once I was blind, but now I see.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Now through His life we have the flow,
Showing us the way to go;
Keeping us in unity,
And this is His recovery.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Now Jesus is the Lord of all;
On His name we all must call.
Then our spirits find release,
And thus our hearts have found real peace.</stanza>
