    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Jesus, Jesus our Redeemer
Has become our Jubilee,
Sent to proclaim the release
Of all held in captivity.
To the blind recovered sight&amp;mdash;
The release of all oppressed.
To proclaim the year of the Lord,
Hallelujah Jubilee.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Jesus, Jesus our Redeemer
Has secured our liberty,
He has freed us from our bondage
Now in His life we are free.
From the darkness to the light&amp;mdash;
Now in Him reality.
We proclaim the year of our Lord,
Hallelujah Jubilee.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Jesus, Jesus our Redeemer
Has restored us to the land,
He has brought us to the Father
Now fore'er to dwell in Him.
From a distant land to home&amp;mdash;
His embrace now comforts us.
We proclaim the year of our Lord,
Hallelujah Jubilee.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Jesus, Jesus our Redeemer
Has restored the family,
Brothers, sisters we are here now
In God's house eternally.
No more strangers from His love&amp;mdash;
Now His children ere to be.
We proclaim the year of our Lord,
Hallelujah Jubilee.</stanza>
