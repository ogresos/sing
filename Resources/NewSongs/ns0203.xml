    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Lord, I have the life; but Lord, You know
That I need the lights of the fourth day.
I have the light from the first day already,
But I need the lights of the fourth day.
Lord Jesus, I need You as the Sun.
I need to contact You directly.
I want to be in Your presence
Day by day, I want to be under Your shining.
I also need the church, the moon,
And I need the stars;
I need the overcoming saints,
The ones who are shining, who turn many to righteousness,
I need those who can turn people
From darkness to light!</stanza>
