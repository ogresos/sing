    <stanza type="verse" number="">Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard
and which have not come up in man's heart;
things which God has prepared for those who love Him;
things which God has prepared for those who love Him.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="">But to us God has revealed them through the Spirit,
for the Spirit searches all things,
even the depths of God.
For who among men knows the things of man,
except the spirit of man which is in him?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="">In the same way, the things of God also
no one has known except the Spirit of God;
no one has known except the Spirit of God.</stanza>
