    <stanza type="verse" number="1">We must redeem the time!
Let it not slip away,
For we will stand before the Lord
That coming day.
Redeem the time!
Seize every opportunity;
  Redeem the time!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">We must redeem the time!
The Lord is drawing nigh.
And just around the bend
We'll hear the midnight cry.
Redeem the time!
Seize every opportunity;
  Redeem the time!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">We must redeem the time!
Each opportunity
Will come and pass
Ne'er to return eternally.
Redeem the time!
Seize every opportunity;
Redeem the time!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">We must redeem the time!
Buy back the time we've lost.
Forsaking all to pay the price
Is worth the cost.
Redeem the time!
Seize every opportunity;
  Redeem the time!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">We must redeem the time!
We have not time to spare;
Each moment He hath measured
For us to prepare.
Redeem the time!
Seize every opportunity;
Redeem the time!</stanza>
