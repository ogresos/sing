  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Let Him kiss me with the kisses of His mouth,
Whether bitter cold north wind or gentle south;
You are beautiful, my love,
With your eyes of turtledoves;
"Let Him kiss me with the kisses of His mouth".</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Lord I love You, I really love You,
You're the dearest, sweetest, precious love to me!
Lord I love You, I really love You,
Jesus, my Beloved, for eternity!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">She's become a lily, simple, pure and sweet,
Not relying on her naturalness and strength
She is trusting in Christ's life,
In His rich abundant life;
"Let Him kiss me with the kisses of His mouth".</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">She's become a garden, fountain, streams, and springs,
From which fragrant, luscious produce Christ's life brings,
Resurrection life expressed,
In ascension she can rest;
"Let Him kiss me with the kisses of His mouth".</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">She's become the New Jerusalem, His Bride,
Where His presence for eternity abides,
Here His faithfulness we prove,
And we serve Him for His move;
"Let Him kiss me with the kisses of His mouth".</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">In the final stage of love a kiss remains,
Where the lover and His love forever reign,
"When I find you here with Me, 
I will kiss you, all will see";
"Let Him kiss me with the kisses of His mouth".</stanza>
