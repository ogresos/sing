  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Christ lives in me, oh how can this be?
He breathed Himself as life to me.
How simple, and normal, His life becoming mine.
Yes, Lord, keep spreading in my being.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Christ lives in me, oh what a mystery.
Not seen nor heard, yet still lovely.
Beautiful and charming, I can't stop loving Him.
Jesus, most precious One to me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Christ lives in me, yes, my reality.
Oh Tree of Life, I eat freely.
Enjoying, day by day, I live because of Him.
Dear Lord, You taste so good to me.</stanza>
