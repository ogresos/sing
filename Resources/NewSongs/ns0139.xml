    <stanza type="verse" number="1">I thought I knew You, I did not love You;
I thought I met You, I had only heard of You.
You whispered to me, I shut my ears, Lord.
You tried to show me that You could be something more.

And then You caught me&amp;mdash;
The great love You had for me&amp;mdash;
I could not help but love Thee.
Lord, Your compassion had drawn me so entirely.
At last, I glimpsed Your beauty.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">I felt so filthy, You shone on my sin.
I asked Your pardon, then You cleansed me from within.
My eyes were opened, now I could see You.
You were more real than anything I ever knew.

And then You freed me&amp;mdash;
You hung and died on a tree&amp;mdash;
I wasn't even worthy.
Lord, then You found me and rescued me from my sins.
Lord, You are full of mercy.</stanza>
