  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">In contact through the ages, God designates Himself;
"Jehovah" is His title as He speaks to us.
Not distant and unknowable, but seen with Abraham
Whose contact, sweet and intimate.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">The "I Am Who I Am," the self-existing One,
What miracle that He would stoop to us;
Not formal ways from concept
But sweet relationship
That comes as conversation of two friends.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">While Abraham remained standing before Jehovah,
His purpose was to intercede for Lot, for Lot.
This glorious intercession that Abraham made
Was just a human conversation.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Not a stranger you talk to in the grocery store once,
Not a relative you call twice a month;
This human relationship between God and man
Comes from many interactions.</stanza>
