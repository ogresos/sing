    <stanza type="verse" number="">He brought me in, into His banqueting house,
And His banner high over me was just love.
Here I'm refreshed and sustained by His love,
For I'm sick, sick with love, in love with Him.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="">Sustain me love with the sweet raisin cakes,
And refresh me with the apples so sweet,
Here I am conquered by Your sweet, sweet love,
For I'm sick, sick with love, in love with You.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="">His left hand is under my head,
And His right hand embraces me.
I am held and embraced by Him,
Oh daughters of Jerusalem.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="">He brought me into His banqueting house,
And His banner over me was love,
I'm sick with love for Him.</stanza>
