    <stanza type="verse" number="1">I'm thankful that God has placed me
With you to build up His Body.
Christ in you is the hope for me!
You also need Christ lived in me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">I live, if you stand firm in the Lord.
You live, if I stand firm in the Lord.
My going on is for you,
Your going on is for me,
Not sep'rate entities,
I need you saints desp'rately!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Oh, what a sweet church life have we!
Built up in Him, His bride to be!
In Him steadfast, you help me be;
Encouraged by Christ whom I see.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Your faith in Christ helps me pursue;
My progress depends upon you!
As I seek Christ, with you in view,
My heart, full of prayers, is for you.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">God's heart longs, desires that we,
His lovers, seek Him corp'rately.
On each other spent constantly;
My life is for you, yours for me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">I want to encourage you all,
Without your supply I would fall.
Never think that your Christ is small.
Christ needs you, and so do we all.</stanza>
