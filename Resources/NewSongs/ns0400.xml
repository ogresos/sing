  <lyrics>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Bit by bit, day by day, His dear words of grace,
Ever fresh, ever sweet, warm my heart apace;
Spirit of wisdom and revelation grant,
Show us our glorious hope and inheritance;
Strengthen us, Lord, into our inner man with strength,
So that Christ may make His home in our hearts through faith. </stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Bit by bit, day by day, I His grace receive;
Grief and fears, pass away! How He cares for me!
In petition and prayer, tell Him everything
And the peace, peace of Christ, passes all we think. 
I pursue towards the goal, run to gain the prize;
Just to know my treasured Christ, all else I'd despise. </stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Bit by bit, day by day, pow'r of God is shown,
What is seen's temporal, what's unseen we'd know;
Treasure in jars of earth, show God's pow'r divine,
Sharing in Jesus' death, that His life may shine;  
We do not proclaim ourselves, Christ do we proclaim,
And ourselves as His bondslaves, this is all our aim.</stanza>
