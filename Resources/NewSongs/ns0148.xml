    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Just to behold You.
Lord, that's all I desire.
And just to love You.
Set my heart afire.

Just loving You and only You.
Lord, You're my goal and focus too.
Lord, I love You.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Just captivate me.
Lord, draw me closer to You.
And win me fully
To run after You.

Just seeking You and only You.
Lord, You're my goal and focus too.
Lord, I treasure You.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Just to pursue You.
Lord, I count all things as loss and
Stretch forward to You
And lay hold of You.

Pursuing You and only You.
Lord, You're my goal and focus too.
Lord, I pursue.</stanza>
