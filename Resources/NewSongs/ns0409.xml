    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Triune God,
Oh how much You love us.
Triune God,
You gave Yourself to us.
Triune God,
Now You're the Spirit in us,
We are one with You always.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="1">O God our loving Father,
You would receive back Your Son,
Christ the Son our Shepherd
And the Holy Spirit's sweeping
To bring us back to You always.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">God the Father's the staff,
Christ the rock smitten for us,
Once stricken, water poured out,
Issued in the Spirit flowing
That we may have His life always.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">The Triune God's dispensing
Himself to us as our life,
His grace is love expressed and
Fellowship keeps us together;
We're mingled now with Him always.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Triune God,
Oh how much we love You.
Triune God,
We give ourselves to You.
Triune God,
Now we open to You,
We are one with You always.</stanza>
