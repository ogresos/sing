    <stanza type="verse" number="1">When I first believed, and His life I received,
The seed was sown into me.
Now this seed must grow, and this zoe life flow
As on to maturity.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Am I a person of life?
Do I experience life?
Does my living bear the issues of life?
Good trees bear good fruit;
Healthy plant, healthy root;
Oh Lord! The ground in my heart!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">We know that life's seed is growing indeed
When fruits of life are expressed
Such as virtues of joy, peace, faithfulness, love.
Does my daily life pass the test?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">When these virtues show others surely will know
The beauty of life will shine,
And the gospel word of life will be heard
Bringing many to know life divine!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Lord grant me today, a new start in this way.
A person of life I would be&amp;mdash;
Just expressing You in all that I do.
Oh may this life flow out of me!</stanza>
