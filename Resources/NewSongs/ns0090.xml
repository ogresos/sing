    <stanza type="verse" number="1">How could this age be so dark, Lord?
All around persecute You.
Though cruel religion would slay You,
No one takes thought or concern.
While Your heart ached for God's chosen,
We were just lepers You cleansed.
While they reject Your speaking,
We were the dead ones You raised.
While they despised Your Person,
We are the grateful You saved.

Lord, we're so glad to be
The house in Bethany.
We bid You rest and eat,
Come, we've prepared for Thee.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Safe in this house, Lord You're cherished,
We treasure You above all!
We grasp the chance to be with You,
Your presence our greatest joy.
Comfort Your heart with our tears, Lord,
Wash the world's hatred away.
May we serve You a meal, Lord?
May we share in Your trial?
May we prepare Your Body?
May our love satisfy.

Oh! We are blessed to be,
Your house in Bethany.
Sharing Your table, we
Focus our gaze on Thee.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Lord, in our eyes You are worthy,
And what we have, Lord, we give.
Breaking our flask we anoint Thee,
What is most precious we spend.
All our heart's ointment so costly,
Lord, we pour out on Thee.
May all the house be filled, Lord,
With fragrance sweet to Thee.
May Your whole church then hunger,
With more desire for Thee.

Lord, may we always be,
With You in Bethany.
Our free will offering,
The best, poured out on Thee.</stanza>
