    <stanza type="verse" number="1">"I will impart My laws into their mind,"
Our covenanting God revealed to mankind;
"I will inscribe My laws upon their heart,"
God's highest law of life into us impart.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Christ is the title deed of all God is;
Christ is a testament with all its bequests;
Now the New Testament is ours to claim,
As we in spirit call upon His name.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">"I will be God to them" declares the Lord,
Christ, our inheritance, described in God's Word;
"And they will be to Me a people," possessed
As God's inheritance, His riches expressed.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">"For all will know Me" and consecrate,
Even the little ones and also the great;
All have capacity to live such a life;
All live in oneness, abiding in Christ.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">"I will propitiate," forgiving sin,
Cleansing the inward parts and washing within;
Christ's efficacious blood has set us free,
Restoring fellowship eternally.</stanza>
