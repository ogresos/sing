    <stanza type="verse" number="1">God wants His holy people to become His army;
Rise up, all ages! March on for His testimony;
Christ is our meaning of life, testimony and center,
In everything He's the way, the goal and the Leader.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">For God to gain His army, priesthood, and dwelling place,
Defilement must be dealt with, that to Him we'd be chaste,
Make us the same as You, Lord, truly righteous and holy,
Meeting Your strict requirements, becoming Your army.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">In our journey to gain Christ&amp;mdash;the good land giv'n by God,
Hindrances and trials would come when we walk with the Lord,
Through suff'rings we'd be humbled and in spirit contrite,
And be exposed through testing, thus purged and purified.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">To inherit the good land, we must be renumbered;
Make a willing vow to Him to fulfill His standard.
For the Lord's up-to-date move, let's fight and pay the price,
Enter and possess the land, our all-inclusive Christ!</stanza>
