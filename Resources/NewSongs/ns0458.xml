    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Dead in sin and void of purpose,
In pursuit of vanity;
Occupied with life's vainglory,
Groped I for my life's true meaning
In the world and without Thee,
In the world and without Thee.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Then one day I heard the gospel,
I believed and called on Thee;
Thou as life came in to fill me,
Making life so full of meaning
As the Son revealed in me,
As the Son revealed in me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">All-inclusive was the transfer,
Baptized&amp;mdash;four-fold&amp;mdash;into Thee,
Into Thy death, Body, and Person,
Thus to live and walk in newness;
One in life and living with Thee,
One in life and living with Thee.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Captivated by Thy beauty,
I left all to follow Thee;
All my hopes and dreams forsaking,
Counting all as loss and refuse;
Losing sight of all but Thee,
Losing sight of all but Thee.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Strengthening me with Thy power,
Through Thy Spirit inwardly;
From my spirit Thou art spreading,
All my soul Thou art transforming;
Thou art making home in me,
Thou art making home in me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">I'd grow up in Thee in all things
Till I am the same as Thee;
Till through me, Thou, once more living,
And my human virtues filling;
Art thus fully formed in me,
Art thus fully formed in me.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="7">Using all things, persons, and matters
Thou art disciplining me
Till by outer man consuming,
And my inner-man renewing;
'Tis no longer I but Thee
'Tis no longer I but Thee. </stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="8">Not alone but with Thy members
Thou art sweetly placing me;
Fitting me into Thy building,
Blending out all self distinctions,
That Thy church would builded be,
That Thy church would builded be.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="9">Till that day I stand before Thee;
Render my account to Thee,
Grant me grace that I'd live daily
One with Thee in Thine appearing;
Thou, my glorious hope, to be,
Thou, my glorious hope, to be.</stanza>
