    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Beloved we are children of God,
And through this life we onward trod;
When He is seen on earth again
We will be seen as only Him,
Even as He is.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Even as He is,
Even as He is,
Even as He is we will be;
Even as He is we will be.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">He who has this hope in Him
Is purified in how he lives;
By living Christ as righteousness,
He lives a life in blessedness,
Even as He is pure.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Little children don't be led astray,
We will see Him on judgment day;
He who is righteous and lives in light,
Will live Him out as He is right,
Even as He is right.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">In this we know that we are Him,
And while in Him we cannot sin;
We live in Him, live side by side,
We walk in Him, with Him abide,
Even as He walked.</stanza>
