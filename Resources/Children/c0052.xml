    <stanza type="verse" number="1">In God's green pastures feeding by His cool waters lie;
Soft in the evening walk my Lord and I,
All the sheep of His pasture
Fare so wondrously fine; His sheep am I.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Sisters: Waters cool,
Brothers: In the valley;
Sisters: Pastures green,
Brothers: On the mountain,
Sisters: In the evening
Brothers: In the evening
Everyone: Walk my Lord and I.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Sisters: Dark the night,
Brothers: In the valley,
Sisters: Rough the way,
Brothers: On the mountain,
Sisters: Step by step...
Brothers: Step by step.
Everyone: My Lord and I.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Through the streets of the city in the darkness of the night,
Far from the fold, He heard my lonely cry.
Now I sit at His table in the palace of light;
His sheep am I.</stanza>
