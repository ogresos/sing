    <stanza type="verse" number="1">We're gonna be God's serving children,
We're gonna serve someone today.
We'll look around; see what to do.
Work until the job is thru.
We're gonna be God's serving children,
We're gonna serve someone today.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">We're gonna be God's serving children,
Everyone help someone today.
Mom needs a hand; I have two for
Folding up the laundry and making stew.
We're gonna be God's serving children,
Everyone help someone today.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">We're gonna be God's serving children,
We're gonna serve someone today.
Dad needs a hand; I have two.
Taking out the trash is what I'll do.</stanza>
