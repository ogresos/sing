    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Remember your Creator
While you are young,
As a child, know the Scriptures
And seek out God's truth.
Oh, remember your Creator
While you are young,
And let Him have a way
In the days of your youth.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Remember your Creator
While you are young.
To remember our Creator
Means to love Him.
The Lord is the Creator,
Our source of life.
In the days of our youth
We would love only Him.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">We treasure the Word of God
While we are young,
As a child, we may read it
And read it again.
Yes, the Scriptures are able
To make us wise,
Wise unto salvation
In Jesus the Lord.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">We come to the light
When we come to God's Word,
How the light brightly shines
When we really love God!
As we love Him and seek Him,
God opens His Word,
So that God's light shines brightly
In His holy Word.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">We like to spend time
In the Word of our God,
To be faithful to read it
With diligent care.
Yes, we read and we pray,
And we pray what we read&amp;mdash;
In the days of our youth,
We would open God's Word.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Remember your Creator
While you are young,
From a child, know the Scriptures
And seek out God's truth.
Oh, remember your Creator
All your life long.
And let HIm have a way
All your days on the earth.</stanza>
