    <stanza type="verse" number="1">The heaven and the earth God made.
Foundations of the earth He laid.
And His great power was displayed&amp;mdash;
The angels sang for joy.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">The angels sang for joy,
The angels sang for joy,
The heavens and the earth God made,
The angels sang for joy.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">The earth became as dark as night,
And then God said, Let there be light,
And there was light, yes, there was light,
And God saw it was good.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">And God saw it was good,
And God saw it was good,
Let there be light: and there was light,
And God saw it was good.</stanza>
