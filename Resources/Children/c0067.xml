    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Remember your Creator
While you are young,
As a child, know the Scriptures
And seek out God's truth.
Remember your Creator
While you are young,
Let Him have a way
In the days of your youth.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Remember your Creator
While you are young.
To remember our Creator
Means to love Him.
The Lord is the Creator,
Our source of life.
In the days of our youth
We would love only Him.</stanza>
