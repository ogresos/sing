Can you say, "How do you do, how do you do?"
We can say, "How do you do?" and "I'm just fine and how are you?"
We can say, "How do you do, do you do?"</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Can you give a hand a shake, hand a shake, hand a shake?
Can you give a hand a shake, hand a shake?
We can smile and give a shake, a new friend then we will make,
We can give a hand a shake, hand a shake.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Can you look 'em in the eye, in the eye, in the eye?
Can you look 'em in the eye, in the eye?
We can look 'em in the eye, not the floor and not the sky!
We can look 'em in the eye, in the eye.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Can you greet with, "Buenos dias, buenos dias, buenos dias",
Can you greet with "Buenos dias, buenos dias."
We can greet with "Buenos dias, we're so glad you came to see us!"
We can greet with "Buenos dias, buenos dias."</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">Can you bow bending low and say, "Ahn nyeong hasayo?"
Can you bow low and say, "Ahn nyeong hasayo?"
We can bow bending low and say, "Ahn nyeong hasayo!"
To Koreans we say, "Ahn nyeong hasayo."</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="6">Can you nod and say, "Nee how," say, "Nee how,"say, "Nee how,"
Can you nod and say, "Nee how," say, "Nee how."
We can nod and say, "Nee how;" They'll say, "You know Chinese, WOW!"
We can nod and say, "Nee how," say, "Nee how."</stanza>
