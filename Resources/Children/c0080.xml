    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Oh, Lord, how we love the works of Your hands,
The works of Your hands, the works of Your hands!
Oh, Lord, how we love the works of Your hands,
The wonderful works of Your hands!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">The whispering pines in the forest so green;
A tree with a limb that can hold up a swing!
The geese who are honking, the robins that sing:
Are the wonderful works of Your hands!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">The sun shining brightly just after the rain,
A field that is waving with golden grain;
The weather and seasons which You have ordained:
Are the wonderful works of Your hands!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">The herbs and the plants and the flowers and trees,
The birds in the sky, the fish in the seas!
Plus animals, insects and people we see,
Are the wonderful works of Your hands!</stanza>
