    <stanza type="verse" number="1">People like to know how things have occurred.
How did things we see ever come to be?
Who, who, who was there? Who, who, who was there?
Who, who, who was there? Who was there with God?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">If you want to know Who made all things so,
Go right to the Source, which is God, of course!
Who, who, who was there? Who, who, who was there?
Who, who, who was there? Only God was there!</stanza>
