    <singingstanza>Once I thought the love of God was just for you and me. Once I thought we were the on -- ly ones. Now I know God's love can find all those from sea to sea; And when it finds them, they be -- come His sons. God's love is warm -- er than the warm -- est sun -- shine, Soft -- er than a sigh. God's love is deep -- er than the deep -- est o -- cean, Wid -- er than the sky. God's love is bright -- er than the bright -- est star That shines ev -- ery night a -- bove; And there is noth -- ing in this world That can ev -- er change His love.</singingstanza>

    <stanza type="verse" number="">Once I thought the love of God was just for you and me.
Once I thought we were the only ones.
Now I know God's love can find all those from sea to sea;
And when it finds them, they become His sons.
God's love is warmer than the warmest sunshine,
Softer than a sigh.
God's love is deeper than the deepest ocean,
Wider than the sky.
God's love is brighter than the brightest star
That shines every night above;
And there is nothing in this world
That can ever change His love.</stanza>
