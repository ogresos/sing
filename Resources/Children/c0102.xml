    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Why was a cup made?
To have a drink inside it.
Why was a shoe made?
To have a foot inside it.
Why was an envelope made?
To have a letter inside it.
Why were you and I made?
To have God's life in us.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Why was a glove made?
To have a hand inside it.
Why was a purse made?
To have some coins inside it.
Why was a flower vase made?
To have some flowers inside it.
Why were you and I made?
To have God's life in us.</stanza>
