    <singingstanza>When you see the fall -- ing rain out -- side, Are you sad that you can't play? But just think what good all those drops can do For the plants and trees that drink that way... Who has made all the rain clouds? That send drip -- drops a -- bun -- dant -- ly? It is God Who gives us rain to -- day, And it comes down won -- der -- f'lly!</singingstanza>

    <stanza type="verse" number="1">When you see the falling rain outside,
Are you sad that you can't play?
But just think what good all those drops can do
For the plants and trees that drink that way...</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Who has made all the rain clouds?
That send drip-drops abundantly?
It is God Who gives us rain today,
And it comes down wonderf'lly!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Streams and rivers and brooks and lakes,
There are oceans and waterfalls and seas.
We can swim, take a bath, jump in puddles too!
Wash our hands and drink a cuppa tea!</stanza>
