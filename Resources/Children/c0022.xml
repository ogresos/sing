    <stanza type="verse" number="1">All English children call Him, "Lord,"
And all the Spanish say, "Senor,"
With all the Germans who call Him, "Herr."
They are calling His name everywhere.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">"O Shuyo," call the Japanese,
"O Tju Ah," echo the Chinese,
"O Hallelujah," they all exclaim.
In each land they are praising His Name.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Children are meeting in Brazil,
Canada, Mexico, Taiwan,
England, New Zealand, and Germany.
Hear them all, as they sing joyfully.</stanza>
