    <stanza type="verse" number="1">In Matthew's house and at his table,
Jesus was there to eat with all the sinners.
Strong ones don't need a physician,
He came for those who are ill.</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Then Jesus went to visit,
To teach and preach and heal.
To shepherd all the lost ones,
Compassion He did feel.</stanza>

The harvest is great but the workers are so few!
Pray to the Lord of the harvest
