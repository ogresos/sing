    <stanza type="verse" number="1">We rush through the door and there's so much to say,
But Mom's on the bed and she looks kind of gray.
Shhhhh... This is when we're quiet.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">I'm in the library, looking at books,
If I make a noise then I get funny looks.
Shhhhh... This is when we're quiet.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Today's our meeting, my friends have all come,
We've sung and we've chatted, now story's begun.
Shhhhh... This is when we're quiet.</stanza>
