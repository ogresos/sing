    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Where are your shoes?
Where are your shoes?
Can't find them! Can't find them!
They are where you left them.
They are where you left them.
Where is that? Where is that?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">If you put them, if you put them,
In their place, in their place,
You'll know where to find them.
You'll know where to find them.
They'll be there! They'll be there!</stanza>
