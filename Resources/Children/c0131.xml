    <stanza type="verse" number="1">May your spirit and your soul
And your body be preserved,
To the coming of the Lord,
Be preserved! Be preserved!
Your whole spirit and whole soul
And your body be preserved,
Be kept blameless till He comes,
Be preserved! Be preserved!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">There's an outer part of me&amp;mdash;
That's my body&amp;mdash;you can see,
But there's more to me than this&amp;mdash;
More than this, more than this.
Yes, my body's where I live&amp;mdash;
Like my house, I am inside,
Like the clothes that I may wear,
I'm inside! I'm inside!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Deeper than the part you see
Is my soul&amp;mdash;yes, that is me!
And this soul has its own parts:
Mind and will! Feelings, too!
With my soul I feel and think,
With this soul my choices make,
With my soul I love and choose&amp;mdash;
Love the Lord! Choose the Lord!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="4">Deep within this inner part
There's a special part of me&amp;mdash;
It's my spirit&amp;mdash;for the Lord!
Deepest part! For the Lord!
This one part just matches God&amp;mdash;
Here my conscience speaks for Him,
It's reserved just for the Lord&amp;mdash;
Deepest part! For the Lord!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="5">May your spirit and your soul
And your body be preserved,
Your whole being, sanctified
By our God! God of peace!
Without blame before the Lord,
Your whole being, till He comes,
Be kept blameless and so pure,
Be preserved! Be preserved!</stanza>
