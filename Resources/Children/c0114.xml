    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Plants, fish, birds, and animals and man,
All things created by God through His Word.
Among all these He made one specially,
Specially to love Him.
Now which one could it be?</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Plants, fish, birds, and animals and man,
All things created God through His Word.
If you look upon the face of all the land,
Only one can love the Lord.
The only one is man!</stanza>
