    <stanza type="verse" number="1">All things, all things
Came into being, came into being;
All things, all things
Came into being thru Him.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Green frogs, pink hogs
Came into being, came into being;
Big blue whales, slimy snails
Came into being thru Him.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">Skies of blue, morning dew
Came into being, came into being;
Streams that flow, falling snow
Came into being thru Him.</stanza>
