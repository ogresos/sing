    <stanza type="verse" number="">I want to thank God for making me,
So very specially.
Each part so perfectly,
He made me awesomely!
I want to thank God for making me,
He made me wonderfully,
For He created me!</stanza>
    <stanza type="chorus" number="">Oh yes, my bones, my muscle, stomach
And my lungs, my heart and brain,
My external parts, my skin, body and head.
Your works are wonderful
And my soul knows it well.
I will give thanks;
Thank You Lord for I am
Wonderfully made.</stanza>
