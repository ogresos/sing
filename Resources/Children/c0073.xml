    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Open up to your parents, open up.
Open up to your parents, open up.
For you know your parents love you,
They're the best ones who can help you,
But it's up to you to come and open up.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Come and tell your troubles to them, open up.
Come and tell your troubles to them, open up.
Let them know how you are feeling,
For you know that they are caring
About everything you're sharing, open up.</stanza>
