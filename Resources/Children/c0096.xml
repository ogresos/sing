    <stanza type="verse" number="1">Drawing near to Jerusalem,
Jesus sent two out to find a colt,
A colt no one had ever ridden on.
"Untie it and bring it back with you.
Tell them the Lord Himself has need of it
And will return it back to them."
People threw their garments on the
Colt for Him to sit on,
And spread them on the road where He would go.</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="2">Cutting branches from the palm trees,
Branches full of tender leaves,
The people layered them up on the road,
Rejoicing and praising their King.
Hosanna, blest is He who's coming,
Coming in the name of the Lord.
Blessed is the coming kingdom
Of our father David,
Hosanna in the highest to our King!</stanza>
    <stanza type="verse" number="3">"Fear not, daughter of Zion;
Behold, your King comes on a colt."
Disciples walked before Him and behind
And for His works of power loudly praised.
Peace in heaven, glory in the highest!
The Pharisees asked Jesus to hush them.
Jesus answered, if they're silent,
Stones themselves will cry out!
And into Jerusalem He went.</stanza>
