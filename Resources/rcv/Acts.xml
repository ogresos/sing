        <note num="2">Luke's Gospel ends with the Lord's ascending into heaven ([link]Luke 24:51[/link]), and his Acts begins with it. His Gospel is a narrative of the ministry of the incarnated Jesus on earth; his Acts is a record of the continuing ministry of the resurrected and ascended Christ in heaven, carried out through His believers on earth. In the Gospels His ministry on earth, carried out by Himself, only sowed Himself as the seed of the kingdom of God into His believers, with no church being built up yet. In the Acts His ministry in heaven, carried out through His believers in His resurrection and ascension, spread Him as the development of the kingdom of God for the building up of the church ([link]Matt. 16:18[/link]) throughout the entire world to constitute His Body, which is His fullness ([link]Eph. 1:23[/link]) for His expression, and which is even the fullness of God ([link]Eph. 3:19[/link]) for God's expression.</note>
        <note num="3">The Lord's ascension points to His coming back. Between these two events is the dispensation of grace that He, as the pneumatic Christ, the life-giving Spirit ([link]1 Cor. 15:45[/link]), might apply His all-inclusive redemption to God's chosen people for their full salvation, that He might produce and build up the church as His Body for the establishing of the kingdom of God on earth.</note>

        <note num="5">This vision of Christ's ascension into heaven strengthened the disciples' faith in Him and in what He had done for them through His death and resurrection. It broadened their view of God's heavenly economy, which had brought them into cooperation with Christ's ministry in the heavens for the carrying out of God's New Testament economy on the earth. The believers should have such a vision concerning Christ's ascension.</note>

They did not contend among themselves but were burdened to continue steadfastly with one accord in prayer, even before the day of Pentecost, when they would receive the outpoured Spirit of power economically ([link]ch. 2[/link]). This is a strong sign and proof that they had received the indwelling Spirit of life essentially on the day of the Lord's resurrection ([link]John 20:22[/link]).

Yet He still needed His chosen people to pray for this. As God in heaven, He needs men on earth to cooperate with Him for the carrying out of His plan.

It was the fulfillment of the Feast of Weeks ([link]Deut. 16:10[/link]), which was also called the Feast of Harvest ([link]Exo. 23:16[/link]), and was counted from the day of the offering of a sheaf of the firstfruits of the harvest, to the day after the seventh Sabbath ([link]Lev. 23:10-11[/link], [link]15-16[/link]). The sheaf of the firstfruits offered before God was a type of the resurrected Christ offered to God on the day of His resurrection ([link]John 20:17[/link]), which was the day after the Sabbath ([link]John 20:1[/link]). From that day to the day of Pentecost there were exactly fifty days (cf. [link]1:3[/link]). The Feast of Harvest typifies the enjoyment of the rich produce brought in by the resurrected Christ. This rich produce is the all-inclusive Spirit of the processed Triune God, given by Him to His chosen people as the blessing of the gospel ([link]Gal. 3:14[/link]) that they may enjoy the all-inclusive Christ (the very embodiment of the Triune God) as their good land. This signifies that the believers, by receiving the bountiful Spirit on the day of Pentecost, not only have entered into the good land but also have participated in the bountiful riches of the all-inclusive Christ ([link]Eph. 3:8[/link]) in His resurrection and ascension, as God's full allotment in His New Testament economy.</note>

        <note num="2">Gk.

According to its usage in this book, [i]pleroo[/i] denotes the filling of a vessel within, as the wind filled the house inwardly in [link]v. 2[/link], and [i]pletho[/i] denotes the filling of persons outwardly, as the Spirit filled the disciples outwardly in this verse. The disciples were filled ([i]pleroo[/i]) inwardly and essentially with the Spirit ([link]13:52[/link]) for their Christian living, and were filled ([i]pletho[/i]) outwardly and economically with the Spirit for their Christian ministry. The inward filling Spirit, the essential Spirit, is in the disciples ([link]John 14:17[/link]; [link]Rom. 8:11[/link]), whereas the outward filling Spirit, the economical Spirit, is upon them ([link]1:8[/link]; [link]2:17[/link]). Every believer in Christ should experience both aspects of the Holy Spirit. Even Christ as a man experienced the same thing: He was born of the Holy Spirit essentially ([link]Luke 1:35[/link]; [link]Matt. 1:18[/link], [link]20[/link]) for His being and living, and He was anointed with the Holy Spirit economically ([link]Matt. 3:16[/link]; [link]Luke 4:18[/link]) for His ministry and move. The essential Spirit was within Him and the economical Spirit was upon Him.[br][br]The outward filling of the poured out Spirit was the ascended Head's baptizing of His Body into the Spirit. On the day of Pentecost the Jewish believers, the first part of His Body, were baptized; in the house of Cornelius the Gentile believers, the second part of His Body, were baptized in the same way ([link]10:44-47[/link]). By these two steps He baptized once for all His entire Body into the Spirit ([link]1 Cor. 12:13[/link]), who is the application and realization of Himself. His baptizing His Body into the Spirit was His baptizing it into Himself. This was the accomplishment of the baptism in the Holy Spirit promised in [link]1:5[/link] by Christ, the Head of the Body.</note>

        <note num="1">Calling on the name of the Lord is not a new practice that began with the New Testament. Rather, it began with Enosh, the third generation of mankind, in [link]Gen. 4:26[/link]. It was continued by Job ([link]Job 12:4[/link]; [link]27:10[/link]), Abraham ([link]Gen. 12:8[/link]; [link]13:4[/link]; [link]21:33[/link]), Isaac ([link]Gen. 26:25[/link]), Moses and the children of Israel ([link]Deut. 4:7[/link]), Samson ([link]Judg. 15:18[/link]; [link]16:28[/link]), Samuel ([link]1 Sam. 12:18[/link]; [link]Psa. 99:6[/link]), David ([link]2 Sam. 22:4[/link], [link]7[/link]; [link]1 Chron. 16:8[/link]; [link]21:26[/link]; [link]Psa. 14:4[/link]; [link]17:6[/link]; [link]18:3[/link], [link]6[/link]; [link]31:17[/link]; [link]55:16[/link]; [link]86:5[/link], [link]7[/link]; [link]105:1[/link]; [link]116:4[/link], [link]13[/link], [link]17[/link]; [link]118:5[/link]; [link]145:18[/link]), the psalmist Asaph ([link]Psa. 80:18[/link]), the psalmist Heman ([link]Psa. 88:9[/link]), Elijah ([link]1 Kings 18:24[/link]), Isaiah ([link]Isa. 12:4[/link]), Jeremiah ([link]Lam. 3:55[/link], [link]57[/link]), and others ([link]Psa. 99:6[/link]), all of whom practiced this in the Old Testament age. Isaiah charged the seekers of God to call upon Him ([link]Isa. 55:6[/link]). Even the Gentiles knew that the prophets of Israel had the habit of calling on the name of God ([link]Jonah 1:6[/link]; [link]2 Kings 5:11[/link]). The Gentile raised up by God from the north also called upon His name ([link]Isa. 41:25[/link]). It is God's commandment ([link]Psa. 50:15[/link]; [link]Jer. 29:12[/link]) and desire ([link]Psa. 91:15[/link]; [link]Zeph. 3:9[/link]; [link]Zech. 13:9[/link]) that His people call on Him. This is the joyful way to drink from the fountain of God's salvation ([link]Isa. 12:3-4[/link]) and the enjoyable way to delight oneself in God ([link]Job 27:10[/link]), that is, to enjoy Him. Hence, God's people must call upon Him daily ([link]Psa. 88:9[/link]). Such a jubilant practice was prophesied by Joel ([link]Joel 2:32[/link]) concerning the New Testament jubilee.[br][br]In the New Testament, calling on the name of the Lord was first mentioned by Peter, here, on the day of Pentecost, as the fulfillment of Joel's prophecy. This fulfillment is related to God's outpouring of the all-inclusive Spirit economically upon His chosen people that they may participate in His New Testament jubilee. Joel's prophecy and its fulfillment concerning God's New Testament jubilee have two aspects: on God's side, He poured out His Spirit in the ascension of the resurrected Christ; on our side, we call on the name of the ascended Lord, who has accomplished all, attained unto all, and obtained all. Calling on the Lord's name is vitally necessary in order for us, the believers in Christ, to participate in and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ with all He has accomplished, attained, and obtained ([link]1 Cor. 1:2[/link]). It is a major practice in God's New Testament economy that enables us to enjoy the processed Triune God for our full salvation ([link]Rom. 10:10-13[/link]). The early believers practiced this everywhere ([link]1 Cor. 1:2[/link]), and to the unbelievers, especially the persecutors, it became a popular sign of Christ's believers ([link]9:14[/link], [link]21[/link]). When Stephen suffered persecution, he practiced this ([link]7:59[/link]), and his practice surely impressed Saul, one of his persecutors ([link]7:58-60[/link]; [link]22:20[/link]). Later, the unbelieving Saul persecuted the callers ([link]9:14[/link], [link]21[/link]) by taking their calling as a sign. Immediately after Saul was caught by the Lord, Ananias, who brought Saul into the fellowship of the Body of Christ, charged him to be baptized, calling on the name of the Lord, to show others that he too had become such a caller. By his word to Timothy in [link]2 Tim. 2:22[/link], Paul indicated that in the early days all the Lord's seekers practiced such calling. Undoubtedly, he was one who practiced this, since he charged his young co-worker Timothy to do this that Timothy might enjoy the Lord as he did.[br][br]The Greek word for [i]call on[/i] is composed of [i]on[/i] and [i]call[/i] (by name); thus, it is to call out audibly, even loudly, as Stephen did ([link]7:59-60[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">The name denotes the person. Jesus is the Lord's name, and the Spirit is His person. When we call, "Lord Jesus," we receive the Spirit.</note>
        <note num="3">This is the conclusion of the quotation of Joel's prophecy, which began in [link]v. 17[/link], indicating that the issue of God's pouring out of His Spirit upon all flesh is their salvation through calling on the name of the Lord. God's outpouring of His Spirit is the applying of the Lord's salvation to His chosen people. To be saved is to receive this Spirit, who is the blessing of the gospel in God's New Testament economy ([link]Gal. 3:2[/link], [link]5[/link], [link]14[/link]). This Spirit is the Lord Himself as the breath ([link]John 20:22[/link]) and the living water ([link]John 4:10[/link], [link]14[/link]) to us. To breathe Him in as our breath and drink Him as our living water, we need to call on Him. [link]Lamentations 3:55-56[/link] indicates that our calling on the Lord is our breathing, and [link]Isa. 12:3-4[/link] indicates that our calling on the Lord is our drinking. After we believe in the Lord, we need to call on Him that we may not only be saved but also enjoy His riches ([link]Rom. 10:12-13[/link]). When we exercise our spirit to call on Him, breathe Him in, and drink Him, we enjoy His riches; this is the real worship to God. The Lord connected such worship ([link]John 4:24[/link]) to the drinking of the living water given by Him ([link]John 4:14[/link]).</note>

        <note num="3">The New Testament uses three different prepositions to describe baptism's relationship to the Lord:[br][br](1) [i]En,[/i] in ([link]10:48[/link]). To be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ is to be baptized in the sphere of the name of Jesus Christ, within which is the reality of the baptism.[br][br](2) [i]Eis,[/i] into ([link]Matt. 28:19[/link]; [link]Acts 8:16[/link]; [link]19:5[/link]; [link]Rom. 6:3[/link]; [link]Gal. 3:27[/link]). To be baptized into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, or into the name of the Lord Jesus, is to be baptized into a spiritual union with the all-inclusive Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God. See notes [link]16[sup]2[/sup] in ch. 8[/link] and [link]19[sup]4[/sup] in Matt. 28[/link].[br][br](3) [i]Epi,[/i] upon, or on ([link]v. 38[/link]). To be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ is to be baptized upon the ground of what the name of Jesus Christ stands for. It stands for all that the person of Jesus Christ is and all that He has accomplished, both of which constitute the belief (the faith) of God's New Testament economy. It is on this ground that the believers in Christ are baptized.</note>
        <note num="4">The name denotes the person.</note>
        <note num="5">Forgiveness of sins is based on the redemption of Christ, which was accomplished through His death ([link]10:43[/link]; [link]Eph. 1:7[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 15:3[/link]); it is the initial and basic blessing of God's full salvation. Based on it the blessing of God's full salvation goes forward and consummates in the receiving of the gift of the Holy Spirit.</note>
        <note num="6">Not any gift distributed by the Spirit, such as is mentioned in [link]Rom. 12:6[/link], [link]1 Cor. 12:4[/link], and [link]1 Pet. 4:10[/link], but the gift that is the Holy Spirit Himself, given by God to the believers in Christ as the unique gift that produces all the gifts mentioned in [link]Rom. 12[/link], [link]1 Cor. 12[/link], and [link]1 Pet. 4[/link]. Those gifts are the abilities and capacities for the service of God, and they come from this unique gift, the Holy Spirit.</note>
        <note num="7">The all-inclusive Spirit of the processed Triune God in His New Testament economy, both essential for life and economical for power, given to the believers at the time of their believing in Christ ([link]Eph. 1:13[/link]; [link]Gal. 3:2[/link]), as the all-inclusive blessing of God's full gospel ([link]Gal. 3:14[/link]) that they may enjoy all the riches of the Triune God ([link]2 Cor. 13:14[/link]).[br][br]The apostles preached and ministered Christ, but when their hearers repented and believed in Him, they received this wonderful Spirit of the Triune God. This implies that this Spirit is just the resurrected and ascended Christ Himself. The receiving of the Spirit here is both essential and economical, in a general and all-inclusive sense, differing from the receiving of the Spirit in [link]8:15-17[/link] and [link]19:2-6[/link], which is particularly the receiving of the Spirit in His falling upon the believers economically.</note>

At the time of Pentecost, everything concerning God's full salvation had been prepared, and the Holy Spirit was poured out as the application and full blessing of God's salvation, ready for man to receive. In this matter God is waiting for man, and man needs to take the initiative. Man, be saved!</note>
        <note num="3">At the conclusion of his message Peter did not say, "Be saved from God's condemnation," or "from eternal perdition," but, "Be saved from this crooked generation." The crooked generation refers to the perverted Jews in that age, who rejected God's Christ ([link]v. 36[/link]) and were considered by God as the "present evil age" ([link]Gal. 1:4[/link]). For the crooked Jews to be saved from their present evil age required a genuine repentance concerning their crookedness toward God and a real turn to God. This indicates that they needed to turn to God not only from their sins but also from their generation, their Jewish society, including their Jewish religion. The result of such a salvation was not their entering into heaven but their entering into a new generation &amp;#8212; the church. Thus, the saved ones were separated from the Jewish society into the church. Being saved in this way implies being saved from God's condemnation and eternal perdition unto God's eternal purpose and His pleasure ([link]Eph. 3:11[/link]; [link]1:9[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">The first group of believers produced through the apostles' preaching and ministering of Christ on the day of Pentecost continued steadfastly in four things: teaching, fellowship, breaking of bread, and prayers. Teaching is the unveiling of God's New Testament economy concerning Christ and the church; fellowship is the communion and communication between the believers in their communion and communication with God the Father and Christ the Son; breaking of bread is the remembrance of the Lord in His accomplishing of God's full redemption; and prayer is cooperation with the Lord in heaven for the carrying out of God's New Testament economy on earth. The first two, teaching and fellowship, conjoined by [i]and[/i] to be one group, are of the apostles, but breaking of bread and prayers are not, indicating that besides the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, the believers in Christ should not have any other teaching and fellowship. In God's New Testament economy there is only one category of teaching revealed and recognized by God &amp;#8212; the teaching of the apostles &amp;#8212; and only one category of fellowship that is of God and is acceptable to Him &amp;#8212; the fellowship of the apostles, which is with the Father and the Son, Jesus Christ ([link]1 John 1:3[/link] and note 3), and which is the unique fellowship of the unique church, the Body of Christ. The last two, the breaking of bread and prayer, also conjoined by [i]and[/i] to be another group, are practices of the believers in their Christian life and are not related directly to God's economy for the keeping of the oneness of the church, the Body of Christ. Hence, they are not of the apostles, who brought in God's New Testament revelation and His fellowship among all the believers in Christ.</note>

It was not only the early believers who were not clear concerning God's New Testament economy in relation to the Judaic temple; even the early apostles did not have a clear vision concerning God's abandoning of the Judaic things. Hence, even after God poured out the Spirit upon them on the day of Pentecost to initiate a new dispensation, they still would not separate themselves from the Judaic temple. At the initial stage God tolerated their ignorance in this matter. But this led to a mixture of the church with Judaism, which was not condemned by the early church in Jerusalem (cf. [link]21:20-26[/link]). Eventually, the temple was destroyed by Titus with his Roman army in A.D. 70, as prophesied by the Lord in [link]Matt. 23:38[/link] and [link]24:2[/link].

        <text>And on the next day their rulers and elders and scribes were [note]1[/note]gathered together in Jerusalem,</text>
        <note num="1">This was a gathering of the Jewish Sanhedrin ([link]v. 15[/link]). In the four Gospels this Sanhedrin, composed of the Jewish leaders, became the strongest opponent of the Lord Jesus and His ministry and condemned Him to death ([link]Matt. 26:59[/link]). Now, in this book, the same Sanhedrin, with the same constituents, began the persecution of the apostles and their ministry ([link]5:21[/link]; [link]6:12[/link]; [link]22:30[/link]). This indicates that Judaism had fallen into the hand of God's enemy, Satan the devil, and was being used by him in his attempt to frustrate and even destroy God's move in His New Testament economy for the carrying out of His eternal purpose, that is, to bring His kingdom to the earth by establishing and building up the churches through the preaching of the gospel of Christ.</note>

        <note num="1">This word was spoken by the Lord in [link]Matt. 21:42[/link] (see note 1 there), quoted from [link]Psa. 118:22[/link]. It unveiled the Jewish leaders' rejection of Him and God's honoring of Him for the building of His habitation among His people on the earth. By this word Peter learned to know the Lord as the precious stone held in honor by God, as he expounded concerning Him in his first Epistle ([link]1 Pet. 2:4-7[/link]). Peter's quoting of this word indicates that he preached Christ not only as the Savior for the sinners' salvation but also as the stone for God's building. It is such a Christ who is the unique salvation to sinners, and it is in His unique name under heaven, a name despised and rejected by the Jewish leaders but honored and exalted by God ([link]Phil. 2:9-10[/link]), that sinners must be saved ([link]v. 12[/link]) not only from sin ([link]Matt. 1:21[/link]) but also to participate in God's building ([link]1 Pet. 2:5[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">Jesus' incarnation made Him a man, His human living on earth qualified Him to be man's Savior, His crucifixion accomplished full redemption for man, His resurrection vindicated His redemptive work, and His exaltation inaugurated Him to be the ruling Leader that He might be the Savior. This exalting of Him was the ultimate step in His being perfected to be the Savior of man ([link]Heb. 2:10[/link]; [link]5:9[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">Or, Prince; the same Greek word as for [i]Author[/i] in [link]3:15[/link]. See note 1 there. God exalted the man Jesus, who had been rejected and killed by the Jewish leaders, as the highest Leader, the Prince, the Ruler of the kings to rule over the world ([link]Rev. 1:5[/link]; [link]19:16[/link]), and the Savior to save God's chosen people. [i]Leader[/i] is related to His authority, and [i]Savior[/i] to His salvation. He rules sovereignly over the earth with His authority that the environment might be fit for God's chosen people to receive His salvation (cf. [link]17:26-27[/link]; [link]John 17:2[/link]).</note>
        <note num="3">To give repentance and forgiveness of sins to God's chosen people requires Christ to be exalted as a ruling Leader and Savior. His sovereign ruling causes and leads God's chosen people to repent, and His salvation, which is based on His redemption, affords them forgiveness of sins.</note>
        <note num="4">Repentance is for forgiveness of sins ([link]Mark 1:4[/link]). On God's side, forgiveness of sins is based on Christ's redemption ([link]Eph. 1:7[/link]); on man's side, forgiveness of sins is through man's repentance.</note>

        <note num="1">This indicates that words must have been circulating among the believers concerning the destruction of the temple, as prophesied by the Lord in [link]Matt. 23:37-39[/link] and [link]24:2[/link], and concerning the termination of the dispensation of law, as spoken by the Lord in [link]Matt. 11:13[/link]. The opposing Jews twisted the believers' words, just as in [link]Matt. 27:40[/link], when they crucified the Lord, they twisted the word that the Lord spoke in [link]John 2:19[/link]. Undoubtedly, the Jews' opposition was instigated by Satan to frustrate God's New Testament economy. But the ground used by Satan for his instigation was the change of dispensation, which contradicted the Judaic traditions. God's New Testament economy is to have a new dispensation absolutely separated from Judaism. This offended the Jews by touching the traditions they had inherited for generations, and it stirred up their opposition, which began with the Lord's ministry in the Gospels and grew more fierce at the time of the apostles' ministry in this book, during which the Lord's New Testament move was passing through a transitional period. According to Luke's narration in Acts, the church among the Jews, including the early apostles, did not pass through this transition successfully, because of the remaining influence of their Judaic background and the entangling opposition from their Jewish kinsmen. This problem returned to trouble them again and again in this book ([link]11:1-3[/link]; [link]15:1-5[/link]; [link]21:18-26[/link]). Even the apostle Paul was in danger of being brought back to the Judaic practices in his last visit to Jerusalem ([link]21:20-26[/link]).

But they had not yet received the Spirit economically to identify them with the Body of Christ. The reason the Holy Spirit did not fall upon them outwardly and economically was so that the apostles, through whom the practical establishing of the church had been initiated in Jerusalem, might come to bring them into identification with the Body of Christ. This case is different from that of the ones in the house of Cornelius, who, when they believed in the Lord, received the Holy Spirit both essentially within them for regeneration and economically upon them for baptism into the Body of Christ ([link]1 Cor. 12:13[/link]) and identification with the Body of Christ. That was because the gospel was preached then directly by Peter, who played the main role in the initiation of the practical establishing of the church.</note>

See notes [link]38[sup]3[/sup] in ch. 2[/link] and [link]19[sup]4[/sup] in Matt. 28[/link].[br][br]In [link]Matt. 28:19[/link] the Lord charged the disciples to baptize the believers into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. But later, in practice, the believers were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus, here and in [link]19:5[/link], and into Christ, in [link]Rom. 6:3[/link] and [link]Gal. 3:27[/link]. This indicates that (1) to be baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus is equivalent to being baptized into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, because the Lord Jesus is the Triune God, the embodiment of God Himself ([link]Col. 2:9[/link]), and (2) to be baptized into the name of the Triune God or into the name of the Lord Jesus is equivalent to being baptized into the person of Christ.</note>
        <note num="3">Since the Samaritan believers had been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus, that is, into the Lord Himself, they surely must have received the Spirit of life essentially within them that they might be not only born of the Lord but also joined to the Lord ([link]1 Cor. 6:17[/link]), although they had not received the Spirit of power outwardly and economically.</note>

Peter and John were sent to Samaria not only to confirm the preaching of the gospel by Philip, one of the seven appointed to serve tables, but also to bring the church in Samaria, composed of Samaritans, with whom the Jews had no dealings, into identification with the Body of Christ by laying their hands on them. The Holy Spirit honored this laying on of hands and fell upon the Samaritans, signifying their identification with the Body of Christ. In this way the Samaritan believers received the Holy Spirit economically in addition to their having received the Holy Spirit essentially when they believed in the Lord Jesus.</note>

        <note num="1">This indicates that Philip preached water baptism to the eunuch. In this gospel case, water baptism was particularly emphasized, but no mention was made of Spirit baptism. This should give us strong instruction that we must pay attention to water baptism, which signifies the believers' identification with Christ's death and resurrection ([link]Rom. 6:3-5[/link]; [link]Col. 2:12[/link]), as well as to Spirit baptism. Spirit baptism produces the reality of the believers' union with Christ in life essentially and in power economically, whereas water baptism is the believers' affirmation of the Spirit's reality. Both are needed (cf. [link]10:47[/link]), and neither can replace the other. All believers in Christ should properly have both, just as the children of Israel were baptized in the cloud (signifying the Spirit) and in the sea (signifying water) &amp;#8212; [link]1 Cor. 10:2[/link].

        <text>And [xref]a[/xref]Ananias went away and entered into the house; and [note]1[/note][xref]b[/xref]laying his hands on him, he said, Saul, brother, the Lord has sent me &amp;#8212; Jesus, who appeared to you on the road on which you were coming &amp;#8212; so that you may [xref]c[/xref]receive your sight and be [note]2[/note]filled with the Holy Spirit.</text>
        <note num="1">Saul's case was a particular one also because, as the most significant persecutor, he had been saved directly by the Lord from heaven while on his way to persecute the believers. Hence, like the Samaritan believers ([link]8:14-17[/link] and note [link]17[sup]1[/sup][/link]) and the twelve disciples in Ephesus ([link]19:1-7[/link]), he needed a member of the Body of Christ to initiate him into identification with the Body of Christ by the laying on of hands.</note>
        <note num="2">Filled outwardly (see note [link]4[sup]2[/sup] in ch. 2[/link]). According to the principle of salvation in God's New Testament economy, Saul must have received the Holy Spirit of life essentially at the time of his conversion, prior to Ananias's coming and laying his hands on him. Before Ananias came, Saul was praying to the Lord ([link]v. 11[/link]), indicating that he had believed in the Lord and was calling on Him (cf. [link]Rom. 10:13-14[/link]) like those believers whom he had ravaged and was going to arrest ([link]vv. 21[/link], [link]14[/link]). But since he had not been saved through any member of the Body of Christ, the Holy Spirit did not fall upon him economically ([link]2:17[/link] and note 2) until Ananias came as the representative of the Body to identify him with the Body of Christ.</note>

        <note num="1">Outwardly and economically (see note [link]8[sup]2[/sup] in ch. 1[/link]). In the case of the house of Cornelius, the Holy Spirit's entering into the believers essentially for life and falling upon them economically for power occurred simultaneously when they believed in the Lord. However, only His falling upon them economically is noted here, because it was outward and could be realized by others through their speaking in tongues and magnifying God ([link]v. 46[/link]). His entering into them occurred silently and invisibly. They received both aspects of the Holy Spirit directly from Christ the Head, without any mediatorial channel, before they were baptized in water by other members of the Body of Christ. This indicates emphatically that the spreading of the gospel of the kingdom of God to the Gentiles was of the Lord, and that the Head of the Body baptized the Gentile believers into His Body directly, without the laying on of hands of any member of His Body, in contrast to the cases of the Samaritan believers and Saul of Tarsus ([link]8:17[/link]; [link]9:17[/link]).</note>

Hence, speaking in tongues is not the only evidence of receiving the Holy Spirit economically; neither is it the necessary evidence, because there is at least one case of the receiving of the Holy Spirit economically, the case of the Samaritan believers ([link]8:15-17[/link]), which does not mention speaking in tongues. In the case of Saul of Tarsus ([link]9:17[/link]) concerning this matter, there again is no mention of speaking in tongues, although he told us later, in [link]1 Cor. 14:18[/link], that he spoke in tongues.</note>

        <note num="1">Like the early apostles and the Jewish believers on the day of Pentecost ([link]2:4[/link]), the Gentile believers in the house of Cornelius received the Holy Spirit economically directly from the ascended Head. Only these two instances in the New Testament are considered the baptism in the Holy Spirit ([link]1:5[/link]; [link]11:15-16[/link]). By these two steps the Head of the Body baptized all His believers, both Jewish and Gentile, once for all into His one Body ([link]1 Cor. 12:13[/link]). Hence, the baptism in the Spirit is an accomplished fact carried out by Christ in His ascension, on the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius. None of the other cases &amp;#8212; the Samaritan believers in [link]ch. 8[/link], Saul of Tarsus in [link]ch. 9[/link], and the twelve Ephesian believers in [link]ch. 19[/link] &amp;#8212; are considered the baptism in the Holy Spirit according to the revelation of the New Testament. These other cases were merely the believers' experiences of the once-for-all-accomplished baptism in the Holy Spirit.[br][br]In this book, concerning the believers' receiving of the Holy Spirit economically, that is, the Holy Spirit's falling upon them, only five cases are mentioned. Two of them are for the accomplishing of the baptism in the Holy Spirit. These are the instances that occurred on the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius. The other three &amp;#8212; the cases of the Samaritan believers, Saul of Tarsus, and the twelve believers in Ephesus &amp;#8212; are considered extraordinary, in that some members of the Body of Christ were needed to identify those believers with the Body by the laying on of hands. Besides these five cases, in many cases of conversion, such as the three thousand ([link]2:41[/link]), the five thousand ([link]4:4[/link]), the Ethiopian eunuch ([link]8:36[/link], [link]38-39a[/link]), the many who believed in Antioch ([link]11:20-21[/link], [link]24[/link]), the many instances in [link]chs. 13[/link] and [link book="Acts"]14[/link] under Paul's preaching ministry, Lydia in Philippi ([link]16:14-15[/link]), the jailer in Philippi ([link]16:33[/link]), the believers in Thessalonica ([link]17:4[/link]), the believers in Berea ([link]17:10-12[/link]), the believers in Athens ([link]17:34[/link]), the ruler of the synagogue and many other believers in Corinth ([link]18:8[/link]), and the believers in Ephesus ([link]19:18-19[/link]), there is no mention of the believers' receiving of the Holy Spirit economically &amp;#8212; the Holy Spirit's falling upon the believers &amp;#8212; because in all these cases the believers were brought into the Body of Christ in a normal way through their believing and had no particular need for a member of the Body of Christ to bring them into identification with the Body by the laying on of hands. According to the principle of God's New Testament economy, they all must have received the Holy Spirit essentially for life and economically for power in a normal way through their believing into Christ.</note>

        <note num="3">This was a great step taken by the Lord for the spread of the gospel of His kingdom to the Gentile world. It was begun from Antioch, a Gentile center in Syria, without the organizing of a mission, without the raising of funds, without human ordination, and without any human plan or method. It was initiated by five faithful and seeking members of the Body of Christ, who gave the Head of the Body an opportunity through their ministering and fasting, that He, as the Spirit, might set them apart to carry out His great commission to spread His kingdom for the establishing of His church in the Gentile world through the preaching of His gospel. This major step had nothing to do with the church in Jerusalem organizationally, and it was not under the authority and direction of Peter and the other eleven apostles in Jerusalem. It was begun solely and purely from a Gentile center, far away from the atmosphere and influence of any Judaic background and practice and even from the practice and influence of the church in Jerusalem. It was absolutely a move by the Spirit, in the Spirit, and with the Spirit through the coordination of the faithful and seeking members of the Body of Christ on the earth with the Head in the heavens. Hence, this was not a religious movement with a human schedule. From Antioch the Lord's move on the earth for God's New Testament economy had an entirely new start. Although the flow of the Lord's move began from Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost and later came to Antioch and went on from Antioch to the Gentile world, it had a purified start by the Spirit at its turn in Antioch.</note>

        <note num="1">The Greek word for [i]the holy things[/i] here is in the plural. The same Greek word is used for [i]Holy One[/i] in the next verse, but in the singular. However, it is not the regular word for [i]holy;[/i] it is a Greek equivalent of the Hebrew word [i]chesed,[/i] which is translated [i]mercies[/i] in [link]Isa. 55:3[/link], and also in [link]2 Chron. 6:42[/link] and [link]Psa. 89:1[/link] in both the Septuagint and the KJV. In [link]Psa. 89[/link], the word [i]mercies[/i] in plural in [link]v. 1[/link] is the same word as for [i]Holy One[/i] in singular in [link]v. 19[/link]. This Holy One is Christ, the Son of David, in whom God's mercies are centered and conveyed. Hence, [i]the holy things of David, the faithful things[/i] refers to the resurrected Christ. This is fully proved by the context, especially by [i]Your Holy One[/i] in the next verse, and by the verse following [link]Isa. 55:3[/link].</note>

The responsibility for the problem should rest with Barnabas, because after this incident he no longer appears in the divine record in Acts concerning the Lord's move in God's New Testament economy. The reason for his failure might have been his natural relationship with Mark, his cousin ([link]Col. 4:10[/link]), who left Barnabas and Paul in a negative way in their first ministry journey ([link]13:13[/link] and note 1). Mark was later recovered to Paul's ministry ([link]2 Tim. 4:11[/link]; [link]Philem. 24[/link]), but Barnabas was not.

        <note num="1">The Epicurean philosophers were the followers of the Greek philosopher Epicurus (341-270 B.C.), whose philosophy was materialism. They did not recognize the Creator and His providence over the world but sought sensuous pleasures, especially in eating and drinking. Some of Paul's words to the Philippians ([link]Phil. 3:18[/link] and note 1) and the Corinthians ([link]1 Cor. 15:32[/link] and note 3) referred to the Epicureans.</note>
        <note num="2">The Stoic philosophers were members of a school of philosophy founded by Zeno (340-265 B.C.). They were pantheists who believed that everything was governed by fate and that all happenings were the result of the divine will, and therefore that man should calmly accept them, free from all passion, grief, or joy. They emphasized that the highest good is virtue and that virtue is the reward given to the soul. Some of the words in Paul's Epistle to the Philippians referred to the Stoics ([link]Phil. 4:11[/link] and note 1).</note>

[link]1 Cor. 11:6[/link], where it is shown that there is a difference between shearing and shaving). Paul was a Jew and kept the vow, but he would not and did not impose it on the Gentiles. According to the principle of his teaching concerning God's New Testament economy, Paul should have given up all the Jewish practices, which belonged to the Old Testament dispensation. However, he still had this vow, and it seems that God tolerated it, probably because it was a vow carried out in private outside Jerusalem and would not have had much effect on the believers.</note>

        <note num="1">The purpose was to carry out Paul's loving concern for the need of the poor saints in Jerusalem. At that time Paul was in Ephesus on his third ministry journey, busy with a heavy burden to carry out his ministry in Asia ([link]1 Cor. 16:8-9[/link]) and in Macedonia and Achaia ([link]1 Cor. 16:5-7[/link]; [link]Acts 20:1-3[/link]). Nonetheless, he still had a burden to spare part of his time for the needy saints in Jerusalem. When he arrived in Corinth, he wrote his Epistle to the saints in Rome, expressing the purpose of his trip and begging them to pray for him concerning this purpose ([link]Rom. 15:25-31[/link]). Although he was an apostle set apart by God for the Gentiles ([link]22:21[/link]; [link]Gal. 2:8[/link]), Paul was still concerned for the Lord's interest among the Jews. His primary concern was for the Body of Christ universally, not merely for his part of the New Testament ministry among the Gentiles.[br][br]Besides this, his purpose in going to Jerusalem at this juncture might also have been to fellowship with James and the other apostles and elders in Jerusalem regarding the Judaic influence on the church there. According to Paul's teachings in the Epistles to the Galatians and the Romans, the decision made by the conference of the apostles and elders in [link]ch. 15[/link] to resolve the problem concerning circumcision must not have been fully satisfactory to him. This undoubtedly troubled him because of his concern for God's New Testament economy, which is to build up the Body of Christ. James's word in [link]21:20-22[/link], after Paul had arrived in Jerusalem ([link]21:17-18[/link]), and his proposal that Paul participate in the four Jewish believers' Nazarite vow ([link]21:23-24[/link]) seem to confirm this view.</note>
        <note num="2">Since the Lord the Spirit dwelt in Paul's spirit ([link]2 Tim. 4:22[/link]; [link]Rom. 8:10-11[/link]), Paul must have purposed according to the leading of the Lord the Spirit. See note [link]16[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 17[/link].</note>

Therefore, he begged the saints in Rome to pray for him concerning his return to Jerusalem ([link]Rom. 15:25-26[/link], [link]30-31[/link]). This might also have been the reason that he was bound in his spirit to go to Jerusalem ([link]v. 22[/link]).

        <note num="2">The apostles appointed the elders in every church ([link]14:23[/link]). But here Paul, the leading one, who did the appointing, said that the Holy Spirit did it, indicating that the Holy Spirit was one with the apostles in their appointing of the elders, and that the apostles did it according to the leading of the Holy Spirit.</note>
        <note num="3">I.e., the elders of the church ([link]v. 17[/link]), proving that [i]overseer[/i] and [i]elder[/i] are synonymous terms denoting the same person. To make an overseer a bishop of a district to rule over the elders of various localities in that district is grossly erroneous. That is what Ignatius did. His erroneous teaching became the basis for the establishing of rank and brought in the hierarchy (see note [link]2[sup]1[/sup] in 1 Tim. 3[/link]).</note>
        <note num="4">The main responsibility of the elders as overseers is not to rule over but to shepherd, to take all-inclusive tender care of the flock, the church of God (see notes [link book="1 Pet." chapter="5"]2[sup]1[/sup][/link] and [link]3[sup]1[/sup] in 1 Pet. 5[/link]).</note>
        <note num="5">Indicating the precious love of God for the church and the preciousness, the exceeding worth, of the church in the eyes of God. Here the apostle did not touch the divine life and nature of the church as in [link]Eph. 5:23-32[/link], but the value of the church as a treasure to God, a treasure which He acquired with His own precious blood. Paul expected that the elders as overseers would treasure the church as God did.[br][br]Both the Holy Spirit and God's own blood are divine provisions for the church that He treasures. The Holy Spirit is God Himself, and God's own blood denotes God's work. God's redemptive work acquired the church; now God Himself, the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit ([link]1 Cor. 15:45[/link]), cares for the church through the overseers.[br][br]God's own blood is the blood of Jesus Christ. This implies that the Lord Jesus is God.</note>

        <note num="1">To be purified with the Nazarites was to become a Nazarite with them, joining them in the fulfilling of their vow. The same word is used in the Septuagint in [link]Num. 6:3[/link] in describing the Nazarite's duties. To take the Nazarite vow was a purification before God.</note>
        <note num="2">The cost of the offerings, which a Nazarite had to pay for the completion of his purification ([link]Num. 6:13-17[/link]). This was very expensive for the poor Nazarites. It was a custom among the Jews, and was considered proof of great piety, that a rich person would pay for the poor the expenses of the offerings.</note>
        <note num="3">To be done at the completion of the Nazarite vow ([link]Num. 6:18[/link]). This shaving differed from the shearing in [link]18:18[/link] (see note 1 there), which was for a private vow.</note>

        <text>Then Paul took the men [i]and[/i] on the following day, [note]1[/note]being purified with them, entered into the temple, giving notice of the [note]2[/note]completion of the days of the purification, until the [xref]a[/xref]offering was offered for each one of them.</text>
        <note num="1">I.e., participating in their Nazarite vow (see note [link]24[sup]1[/sup][/link]). To do this Paul had to enter into the temple and remain there with the Nazarites until the completion of the seven days of the vow; then the priest would offer the offerings for each one of them, including him. Surely he was clear that such a practice was of the outdated dispensation, which, according to the principle of his teaching in the New Testament ministry, should be repudiated in God's New Testament economy. Yet he went through with it, probably because of his Jewish background, which had also been manifested earlier in his private vow in [link]18:18[/link], and probably because he was practicing his word in [link]1 Cor. 9:20[/link]. However, his toleration jeopardized God's New Testament economy; this God would not tolerate. At this point he must have felt that he was in a predicament, and he must have been deeply troubled, longing to be delivered from it. Just at the time when their vow was to be concluded, God allowed an uproar to rise up against him, and what they intended to accomplish was blown away ([link]v. 27[/link]). Moreover, by God's sovereignty Paul was rescued out of his predicament.[br][br]The mixing of Judaic practices with God's New Testament economy was not only erroneous in relation to God's dispensation but also abominable in the eyes of God. This gross mixture was terminated by Him a mere ten years or so later with the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple, the center of Judaism, through Titus and his Roman army. This rescued and absolutely separated the church from the devastation of Judaism.[br][br]God might have tolerated Paul's carrying out of a private vow in [link]18:18[/link], but He would not allow Paul, a vessel chosen by Him not only for the completing of His New Testament revelation ([link]Col. 1:25[/link]) but also for the carrying out of His New Testament economy ([link]Eph. 3:2[/link], [link]7-8[/link]), to participate in the Nazarite vow, a strict Judaic practice. In going to Jerusalem, Paul's intention might have been to clear up the Judaic influence on the church there (see note [link]21[sup]1[/sup], par. 2, in ch. 19[/link]), but God knew that the church there was incurable. Hence, in His sovereignty God allowed Paul to be arrested by the Jews and imprisoned by the Romans that he might write his last eight Epistles (see note [link]11[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 25[/link]), which completed the divine revelation ([link]Col. 1:25[/link]) and gave the church a clearer and deeper view concerning God's New Testament economy ([link]Eph. 3:3-4[/link]). Thus, God left the Judaism-influenced church in Jerusalem to remain as it was until the devastating mixture was terminated with the destruction of Jerusalem. For Paul to write his last eight Epistles to complete God's New Testament revelation was far more important and necessary than for him to accomplish some outward works for the church.</note>

Hence, it offended the Jews and was opposed to the law and the temple, for which they were zealous, and it stirred up their jealousy and hatred to the uttermost, so that they made a plot ([link]20:3[/link]) to do away with Paul ([link]vv. 31[/link], [link]36[/link]).</note>

        <note num="2">Paul faced his opponents in a way different from Christ's way. For the accomplishing of His redemption, Christ was like a lamb brought to the slaughter; and like a sheep dumb before its shearer, He did not open His mouth when judged by men ([link]Isa. 53:7[/link]; [link]Matt. 26:62-63[/link]; [link]27:12[/link], [link]14[/link]). But as a faithful and bold apostle sent by the Lord, Paul needed to make a defense and exercise his wisdom to save his life from his persecutors that he might fulfill the course of his ministry. Although he was willing and ready to sacrifice his life for the Lord ([link]20:24[/link]; note [link]12[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 21[/link]; [link]21:13[/link]), he still endeavored to live longer that he might carry out the Lord's ministry as much as possible.

In order for Paul to wash away, before God and before all the believers, the sins that he had committed in persecuting and arresting the Lord's callers, he was charged by Ananias to call on the name that he had formerly abhorred.

        <note num="3">After man's fall and his being sent out of the garden of Eden ([link]Gen. 3:23[/link]), God in His dispensation wanted man to be responsible to his own conscience. But man failed to live and walk according to his conscience and fell further into wickedness ([link]Gen. 6:5[/link]). After the judgment of the flood, God ordained that man should be under human government ([link]Gen. 9:6[/link]). Man failed in this also. Then, before fulfilling His promise to Abraham concerning the blessing of the nations in his seed, Christ ([link]Gen. 12:3[/link]; [link]Gal. 3:8[/link]), God put man under the test of the law ([link]Rom. 3:20[/link]; [link]5:20[/link]). Man failed this test utterly. All these failures indicate that man has fallen from God to his conscience, from his conscience to human government, and from human government to lawlessness; that is, man has fallen to the uttermost. Hence, to conduct oneself in all good conscience before God, as Paul did, was a great return to God from man's fall. Paul spoke this word to vindicate himself before those who accused him of being a lawless and even reckless person. In his defense he referred again to his conscience in [link]24:16[/link]. This showed his high standard of morality, in contrast to the hypocrisy of the Jewish religionists and the crookedness of the Roman (Gentile) politicians.

Now, through the commander of the Roman cohort, God in His sovereignty again rescued Paul, this time from the hand of the rioting Jews, who had attempted to kill him, that He might separate him from all the dangerous situations and entrapments and send him to a quiet prison. This was to afford him a quiet environment and give him time, whether in Caesarea ([link]24:27[/link]) or in the city of Rome ([link]28:16[/link], [link]23[/link], [link]30[/link]), that through his last Epistles he might release exhaustively to the church throughout the generations the revelation of the mystery of God's New Testament economy that he received from the Lord.

        <note num="4">To carry out His heavenly ministry for the propagating of Himself that the kingdom of God might be established for the building up of the churches as His fullness, the ascended Christ wanted to use not a group of preachers trained by man's teaching to do a preaching work, but a body of His witnesses, martyrs, who bore a living testimony of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ (see notes [link]8[sup]3[/sup] in ch. 1[/link] and [link]16[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 26[/link]). Satan could instigate the Jewish religionists and utilize the Gentile politicians to bind the apostles and their evangelistic ministry, but he could not bind Christ's living witnesses and their living testimonies. The more they bound the apostles and their evangelistic ministry, the stronger and brighter these martyrs of Christ and their living testimonies became. In His appearing to the apostle, the Lord indicated that He would not rescue him immediately from his bonds but would leave him in bonds and bring him to Rome that he might testify concerning Him, as he had done in Jerusalem.

        <note num="1">For his defense Paul wanted to appeal to Caesar (see notes [link]1[sup]2[/sup] in ch. 22[/link] and [link]32[sup]2[/sup] in ch. 26[/link]). This would allow him to fulfill his desire to see Rome for the furtherance of the Lord's testimony ([link]19:21[/link]) and was according to the Lord's indication to him ([link]23:11[/link]). Without this appeal he would have been killed by the Jews who plotted against him (cf. [link]23:12-15[/link]; [link]25:1-3[/link], [link]9[/link]) and would not have been able to write his last eight Epistles. Before his appeal to Rome, he had written only six Epistles: 1 and 2 Thessalonians, Galatians, Romans, and 1 and 2 Corinthians. During his first imprisonment in Rome he wrote Colossians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Philemon. After that imprisonment he wrote 1 Timothy, Titus, and Hebrews. Then, during his second imprisonment he wrote 2 Timothy. Without these last eight Epistles, what a lack the divine revelation would have and what a loss the church would have suffered! His appeal did render great profit and benefit to the Lord's interest.</note>

The first item of the spiritual and divine blessings of the New Testament jubilee, which are the blessings of the gospel of God, is to open the eyes of those who are fallen and turn them from darkness to light, that they may see the divine things in the spiritual realm. To see these things requires spiritual sight and divine light.</note>

        <note num="6">Lit., a portion; referring to a portion of an inheritance. This inheritance is the Triune God Himself with all He has, all He has done, and all He will do for His redeemed people. The Triune God is embodied in the all-inclusive Christ ([link]Col. 2:9[/link]), who is the portion allotted to the saints as their inheritance ([link]Col. 1:12[/link]). The Holy Spirit, who has been given to the saints, is the foretaste, the pledge, and the guarantee of this divine inheritance ([link]Rom. 8:23[/link]; [link]Eph. 1:14[/link]), which we are sharing and enjoying today as a foretaste in God's New Testament jubilee, and which we will enjoy in full in the coming age and for eternity ([link]1 Pet. 1:4[/link]). In the type of the jubilee in [link]Lev. 25:8-13[/link], the main blessings are the liberty proclaimed and the returning of every man to his own possession. In the fulfillment of the jubilee here, liberation from the authority of darkness and the receiving of the divine inheritance are the primary blessings (cf. note [link]32[sup]3[/sup] in ch. 20[/link]).</note>
        <note num="7">Not only positionally but also dispositionally ([link]Rom. 6:19[/link] and note 2, [link chapter="6"]22[/link]). To be sanctified positionally is only to have a change in position and purpose; to be sanctified dispositionally is to be transformed in nature by and with the holy nature of God ([link]2 Cor. 3:18[/link]). To be sanctified is to be saturated with God as our possession for our enjoyment today. Our sanctification will consummate in our maturity in the divine life that we may resemble God and be qualified to fully possess and enjoy Him as our inheritance in the coming age and for eternity.</note>

This life was fully dignified, with the highest standard of human virtues expressing the most excellent divine attributes, a life that resembled the one that the Lord Himself had lived on the earth years before. This was Jesus living again on the earth in His divinely enriched humanity! This was the wonderful, excellent, and mysterious God-man, who lived in the Gospels, continuing to live in the Acts through one of His many members! This was a living witness of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and God-exalted Christ! Paul in his voyage lived and magnified Christ ([link]Phil. 1:20-21[/link]).

This life was a part of the heavenly kingdom life on the Satan-darkened and man-inhabited earth. Apparently, the apostle, as a prisoner in bonds, had entered the region of the dark capital of the Satan-usurped empire; actually, as the ambassador of Christ with His authority ([link]Eph. 6:20[/link]; [link]Matt. 28:18-19[/link]), he had come into another part of the participation in the Body life of Christ's church in the kingdom of God on earth. While he was suffering the persecution of religion in the empire of Satan, he was enjoying the church life in the kingdom of God. This was a comfort and an encouragement to him.</note>

        <note num="2">The kingdom of God is one of the matters emphasized in this book. Luke's writing here both begins ([link]1:3[/link]) and ends with the kingdom of God.[br][br]This book was not actually ended; rather, it was left open that more may be added. The reason for this must have been that the work of the Holy Spirit in preaching Christ for His propagation, multiplication, and spread through the believers of Christ was not yet completed and needed to be continued for a long period of time. Such an evangelistic work for Christ's propagation, multiplication, and spread is according to God's New Testament economy for the producing of many sons for God ([link]Rom. 8:29[/link]) that they might be the members of Christ to constitute His Body ([link]Rom. 12:5[/link]) for the carrying out of God's eternal plan and the fulfillment of His eternal will. This is revealed in detail in the twenty-one Epistles and the book of Revelation, which follow this book. The church produced by Christ's propagation and multiplication is the sphere in which God is expressed and in which He reigns in Christ; hence, the church becomes the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God, along with Christ's propagation and multiplication, grows out of and spreads from God's life. Acts is a record of the spreading of Christ; it is also a record of the kingdom of God, because the kingdom of God is the expansion of Christ. The gospel that is widely preached in this book is the very Christ as the gospel ([link]5:42[/link]), the gospel of Christ, and it is also the kingdom of God as the gospel ([link]8:12[/link]), the gospel of the kingdom of God. The preaching of such a gospel will continue and advance until the whole earth becomes the kingdom of Christ ([link]Rev. 11:15[/link]).[br][br]In the four Gospels God was incarnated, passed through human living, died, and resurrected, thus completing Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God ([link]Col. 2:9[/link]). In Acts this embodiment of God, as the life-giving Spirit ([link]1 Cor. 15:45[/link]), spreads Christ into His believers, i.e., works the processed Triune God into His chosen, redeemed, and transformed people to make them the constituents of the church, through which God may be expressed. The ultimate issue of the church will be the New Jerusalem in eternity future as God's full and eternal expression, which will also be God's eternal kingdom as the sphere in which He reigns in His divine life in eternity forever and ever. This should be the reality and goal of all gospel preaching today.</note>
