        <text>Now in the days when the [xref]a[/xref]judges [note]1[/note]ruled, there was a [note]2[/note][xref]b[/xref]famine in the land.

        <note num="1">Lit., judged. Ruth is an appendix to the book of Judges, contemporary with the first half of Judges. Judges is a book of Israel's miserable history, dark and foul; Ruth is the record of a couple's excellent story, bright and aromatic. The main character in this story is like a lily growing out of brambles and a bright star in the dark night.[br/][br/]The book of Ruth is an important part of the genealogy of Christ ([link]Matt. 1:5[/link]), which is the record concerning the incarnation of Christ. As a Moabitess ([link]v. 4[/link]), Ruth was excluded from the congregation of God's holy people ([link]Deut. 23:3[/link]). Nevertheless, she was brought into the holy elect of God and became an important ancestor of Christ through her marriage to Boaz, the great-grandfather of King David ([link]4:21-22[/link]; [link]Matt. 1:5-6[/link]), which became a factor that ushered in the incarnation of Christ ([link]Matt. 1:5-16[/link]). Hence, Ruth became an important ancestor to bring Christ into humanity through the marvelous incarnation, which made God one with man ([link]Matt. 1:18[/link], [link]20b-23[/link]). This is the intrinsic significance of the content of the book of Ruth. See note [link]5[sup]3[/sup] in Matt. 1[/link].</note>
        <note num="2">The famine in the good land was a lack of life supply for living and satisfaction. It was sent by God to His people as a punishment ([link]Lev. 26:26[/link]; [link]Ezek. 14:13[/link]) because of their forsaking God as their source and Husband and their turning to idols. See note [link]1[sup]1[/sup], par. 1, in Judg. 1[/link].</note>
        <note num="3">Bethlehem, the city of David, would be designated as the birthplace of the coming Christ ([link]Micah 5:2[/link]; [link]Luke 2:4-7[/link]), and Judah was the land of the royal tribe among Israel ([link]Gen. 49:8-10[/link]), the top part of the God-promised land ([link]Exo. 3:8b[/link]), which was the good land ([link]Deut. 8:7-10[/link]), the land of Immanuel ([link]Isa. 8:8[/link]).</note>
        <note num="4">The matter of rest is the key to the book of Ruth. Israel, as God's elect, was living in the God-promised land for the carrying out of God's economy. Remaining in the good land that God had promised and given was the genuine rest ([link]Deut. 12:9[/link]; [link]Heb. 4:8[/link]). Israel's rest, their prosperity for their enjoyment and their contentment, was related to their situation with God in His economy. For an Israelite to leave the good land meant that he was cutting himself off from God's eternal economy. Elimelech was in the good land and had a portion of it, and he should have remained there. However, he foolishly swerved from the ground, the standing, which gave him the opportunity to enjoy the rest in the good land, a rest that ultimately resulted in the bringing of Christ into humanity through incarnation to be the real rest to God's people (see notes [link]2[sup]1[/sup], par. 3, in Gen. 2[/link] and [link]9[sup]1[/sup] in Heb. 4[/link]).</note>
        <note num="5">Elimelech swerved from Bethlehem in Judah to Moab, a country of the descendants of Lot who were born through his incestuous union with his daughter ([link]Gen. 19:30-38[/link]), a place that was rejected and condemned by God ([link]Deut. 23:3-6[/link]), and a country of idolatry ([link]v. 15[/link]; [link]Judg. 10:6[/link]).</note>

        <text>And the man's name was Elimelech, and his wife's name was Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem in Judah. And they went to the country of Moab and remained there.</text>

        <text>And Elimelech, Naomi's husband, [note]1[/note]died; and she was left with her two sons.</text>
        <note num="1">The death of Elimelech and his two sons ([link]vv. 3[/link], [link]5[/link]) was a chastisement from God on the house of Elimelech ([link]v. 20[/link]). It left Elimelech's wife, Naomi, and her two daughters-in-law as widows without children in a foreign country. That was the pitiful result of Elimelech's swerving from the rest in God's eternal economy.</note>

        <text>And they took wives for themselves from among the [note]1[/note]Moabite women. One's name was Orpah, and the second's name was [note]2[/note][xref]a[/xref]Ruth. And they dwelt there about ten years.</text>
        <note num="1">The Moabites, a people born of incest ([link]Gen. 19:30-38[/link]), typify all sinners, who were born of "incest" through the "marriage" union of Adam and a fellow creature, Satan ([link]John 8:41[/link], [link]44a[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">In this bright and aromatic story, Ruth typifies the church in four ways. First, Ruth was a woman in Adam in God's creation and a Moabitess (a sinner &amp;#8212; see note [link]4[sup]1[/sup][/link]) in man's fall. Through the fall the God-created man became a sinner and thus became the old man ([link]Eph. 4:22[/link]; [link]Col. 3:9[/link]) consisting of two parts &amp;#8212; a natural (good) part created by God ([link]Gen. 1:27[/link], [link]31[/link]) and a fallen (evil) part corrupted by sin ([link]Rom. 5:18a[/link], [link]19a[/link]). As a created and fallen person with these two aspects, Ruth typifies the church, before its salvation, as men in God's creation and sinners in man's fall being "our old man" ([link]Rom. 6:6[/link]).[br/][br/]Second, Ruth, the widow of the dead husband, was redeemed by Boaz, who cleared the indebtedness of her dead husband to recover the lost right to her dead husband's property ([link]4:9-10[/link]). In this aspect Ruth typifies the church, whose old man is her crucified husband ([link]Rom. 7:4a[/link]; [link]6:6[/link]), being redeemed by Christ, who cleared away her old man's sin for the recovery of the lost right of her fallen God-created natural man ([link]Eph. 5:25[/link]). Ruth's old husband, Mahlon, typifies the fallen part of our old man, and his indebtedness typifies our sin caused by our fallen part, because of which we lost our right as a God-created being. Ruth herself, as the wife, typifies our natural man, who was created by God to be God's counterpart, His wife, and who was redeemed and regenerated to be the new man as the wife of Christ ([link]Rom. 7:1-4[/link] and notes). Christ's death on the cross destroyed the fallen part of our old man, redeemed the part created by God, and cleared our sin caused by the fallen part, thereby recovering the right of the God-created part.[br/][br/]Third, Ruth, after being redeemed by Boaz, became a new wife to him ([link]4:13[/link]). As such, she typifies the church, which, after being saved, became the counterpart of Christ in the organic union with Him through the regeneration of the church's natural man ([link]John 3:6b[/link], [link]29a[/link]; [link]Rom. 7:4b[/link]). When Ruth married Boaz, she was redeemed from her indebtedness, and she became his new wife for the producing of the needed heirs. In the fulfillment of this type, Christ, our new Husband, died to redeem us and to clear the indebtedness caused by the sins of our old man. Then in resurrection He, as the life-giving Spirit ([link]1 Cor. 15:45b[/link]), regenerated us to make us a new creation ([link]2 Cor. 5:17[/link]) married to Him. After being redeemed and regenerated, our natural man, excluding our fallen part, becomes our new man ([link]Eph. 4:24[/link]) and takes Christ as our new Husband in the divine organic union with Him. Now, in the organic union between Christ and us, we can bring forth Christ and spread Christ by ministering Him to all men universally for His increase ([link]John 3:30[/link]).[br/][br/]Fourth, Ruth (a Gentile sinner) being united to Boaz that she might participate in the inheritance of God's elect typifies the redeemed and regenerated Gentile sinners (the main constituents of the church) being attached to Christ that they may partake of the inheritance of God's promise ([link]Eph. 3:6[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">Ruth chose the goal of participating with God's elect in the enjoyment of Christ, and she even became an important ancestor of Christ, one who helped bring forth Christ into mankind. This was more than just a resolution on the part of the Moabite widow; it was a goal, a choosing. Ruth chose God and His kingdom for the carrying out of God's economy concerning Christ.</note>

        <note num="1">Barley, which ripens earlier than other grains ([link]2 Sam. 21:9[/link]), typifies the resurrected Christ ([link]1 Cor. 15:20[/link]). Barley and wheat ([link]2:23[/link]) typify Christ as the material for making food for both God and His people ([link]Lev. 2[/link]; [link]John 6:9[/link], [link]33[/link], [link]35[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">In this book Boaz typifies Christ in two aspects: (1) As a man, rich in wealth and generous in giving ([link]2:1[/link], [link]14-16[/link]; [link]3:15[/link]), Boaz typifies Christ, whose divine riches are unsearchable and who takes care of God's needy people with His bountiful supply ([link]Eph. 3:8[/link]; [link]Luke 10:33-35[/link]; [link]Phil. 1:19b[/link]). (2) As the kinsman ([link]v. 3[/link]; [link]3:9[/link], [link]12[/link]) who redeemed the lost right to Mahlon's property and took Mahlon's widow as his wife for the producing of the needed heirs ([link]4:9-10[/link], [link]13[/link]), Boaz typifies Christ, who redeemed the church and made the church His counterpart for His increase ([link]Eph. 5:23-32[/link]; [link]John 3:29-30[/link]).

        <note num="1">The field of the God-promised good land ([link]vv. 2-3[/link]) typifies the all-inclusive Christ, who is the source of all the spiritual and divine products as the life supply to God's elect ([link]Phil. 1:19b[/link]; see note [link]7[sup]1[/sup] in Deut. 8[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">God's ordinance concerning the reaping of the harvest was that Jehovah would bless the children of Israel if they left the corners of their fields and the gleanings for the poor, the sojourners, the orphans, and the widows ([link]Lev. 19:9-10[/link]; [link]23:22[/link]; [link]Deut. 24:19[/link]). This not only shows the lovingkindness of God and how great, fine, and detailed He is, but also shows the rich produce of the good land.[br/][br/]In the ordinance of the law given by God through Moses regarding reaping, the size of the corners of the field was not specified. The size depended on the landlord's faith in Jehovah. The larger one's faith in Jehovah was, the larger the corners of the field would be (cf. [link]2 Cor. 9:6-10[/link]). Boaz obeyed this ordinance, thereby testifying to his great faith in Jehovah. Under God's sovereignty this ordinance seems to have been written for one person &amp;#8212; Ruth.</note>

        <text>So she went. And she came and [note]1[/note]gleaned in the field after the reapers; and she happened [i]to glean[/i] in a portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was from Elimelech's family.</text>
        <note num="1">Ruth, as one who had returned to God from her heathen background, exercised her right to partake of the rich produce of the inheritance of God's elect. According to her threefold status as a sojourner, a poor one, and a widow, Ruth exercised her right to glean the harvest. Her gleaning was not her begging but her right. Ruth, a Moabitess, a heathen sinner alienated from God's promises ([link]Deut. 23:3[/link]; cf. [link]Eph. 2:12[/link]), being given the right to partake of the gleaning of the harvest of God's elect typifies the Gentile "dogs" who are privileged to partake of the crumbs under the table of the portion of God's elect children ([link]Matt. 15:21-28[/link] and note [link]27[sup]1[/sup][/link]). Just as Ruth had the right to enjoy the produce of the good land after coming into the land, so we have the right to enjoy Christ as our good land after believing in Him. Ruth's exercising of her right to gain and possess the produce of the good land signifies that, after believing into Christ and being organically joined to Him, we must begin to pursue Christ in order to gain, possess, experience, and enjoy Him ([link]Phil. 3:7-16[/link]).[br/][br/]This book portrays the way, the position, the qualification, and the right of sinners to participate in Christ and to enjoy Christ. According to God's ordination we who have believed into Christ have been qualified and positioned to claim our right to enjoy Christ ([link]Col. 1:12[/link]). This means that we do not need to beg God to save us; rather, we can go to God to claim His salvation for ourselves. We have the position, the qualification, and the right to claim salvation from God. This is the highest standard of receiving the gospel.</note>

        <note num="1">Lit., shall I not seek...? Naomi realized that the proper person to be Ruth's husband was Boaz. Hence, Naomi acted as a "middleman" in order to prod Ruth to get married. The genuine ministers of the New Testament are like Naomi in that they stir up the believers in Christ to love Him as their Bridegroom that they may take Him as their Husband ([link]2 Cor. 11:2[/link]; [link]Rev. 19:7[/link]; [link]21:9-10[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">Or, security. After coming to the good land and exercising her right to enjoy its rich produce, Ruth still needed a home so that she could have rest. This kind of rest could come only through marriage. Although we may be saved and love the Lord, in order to have a home for our rest we must marry the Lord Jesus, taking Him as our Husband, and live together with Him in the church as our home ([link]Rom. 7:4[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 11:2[/link]; [link]Eph. 5:23-32[/link]). Christ as our Husband and the church as our home are a complete unit for us to have a proper and adequate rest.[br/][br/]Considered in the light of [link]Matt. 1:5-6[/link] and [link]16[/link], Ruth's seeking for her rest was actually for the continuation of the genealogy to bring in Christ.</note>

        <note num="1">By gaining a husband and a home for a resting place, Ruth received a reward, a gain, for God's economy. First, she gained a redeeming husband, who typifies Christ as the redeeming Husband of the believers ([link]Rom. 7:4[/link]). Second, Ruth was redeemed by the capable Boaz from the indebtedness of her dead husband ([link]vv. 1-9[/link]), typifying the believers being redeemed by Christ, the almighty, omnipotent Redeemer, from the sin of their old man, their old husband. Third, Ruth became a crucial ancestor in the genealogy that brought in the royal house of David for the producing of Christ ([link]vv. 13b-22[/link]; [link]Matt. 1:5-16[/link]). This indicates that Ruth had an all-inclusive and all-extensive gain with the position and capacity to bring Christ into the human race. She is thus a great link in the chain that is bringing Christ to every corner of the earth. Finally, Ruth also continued the line of the God-created humanity for the incarnation of Christ ([link]Matt. 1:17[/link]). Through Boaz and Ruth the line of humanity that was for Christ's incarnation was prolonged.[br/][br/]Ruth, a Gentile and even a Moabitess, was joined to God's holy elect and became an heir to partake of the holy inheritance through her union with the one of the holy elect who redeemed her. This is not merely a type but a complete prefigure of the Gentile sinners' being brought, with Israel, God's elect, into the divine inheritance through the redemption of Christ in their union with Him ([link]Acts 26:16-18[/link]; [link]Eph. 3:6[/link]).</note>

As illustrated by Samson, the judges moved in God's Spirit of power but not in His Spirit of life. God's Spirit came upon Samson ([link]Judg. 13:25[/link]; [link]14:6[/link], [link]19[/link]), but Samson and many of the judges had no control over their indulgence in lust (see notes [link book="Judg."]16[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 8[/link], [link]5[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 9[/link], and [link]1[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 14[/link] of Judges). In contrast, the book of Ruth is a book not of power but of life. Naomi, Ruth, and Boaz were persons in life to the uttermost. Not one judge was a forefather of Christ. It was Ruth and Boaz who participated in keeping the line in humanity to bring Christ forth out of eternity into time, to bring Christ forth with His divinity into humanity. This shows that only life can bring Christ forth. Only life can keep the lineage, maintaining the thin line to bring God into humanity, to produce Christ, to minister Christ, and to supply the entire human race with Christ. This was done not by the judges but by Ruth and Boaz, who took the way of life.</note>
