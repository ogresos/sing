        <text>[note]1[/note]Paul, an [xref]a[/xref]apostle of Christ Jesus through the [note]2[/note]will of God, to the [note]3[/note][xref]b[/xref]saints who are [note]4[/note]in [xref]c[/xref]Ephesus and are [note]5[/note][xref]d[/xref]faithful in Christ Jesus:</text>
        <note num="1">This book speaks particularly of the church and unveils the church in its seven aspects as (1) the Body of Christ, the fullness, the expression, of the One who fills all in all ([link]v. 23[/link]; [link]4:13[/link]); (2) the new man ([link]2:15[/link]), a corporate man, having not only the life of Christ but also His person; (3) the kingdom of God ([link]2:19[/link]), with the saints as citizens possessing its rights and bearing its responsibilities; (4) the household of God ([link]2:19[/link]), a family full of life and enjoyment; (5) the dwelling place of God, in which He may live ([link]2:21-22[/link]) &amp;#8212; universally, a holy temple in the Lord, and locally, the dwelling place of God in our spirit; (6) the bride, the wife, of Christ ([link]5:24-25[/link]) for Christ's rest and satisfaction; and (7) the warrior ([link]6:11-12[/link]), a corporate fighter, who deals with and defeats God's enemy to accomplish God's eternal purpose.[br][br]A particular characteristic of this book is that it speaks from the viewpoint of God's eternal purpose, from eternity, and from the heavenlies. It is positioned in the New Testament immediately after the revelation concerning Christ versus religion (Galatians). It is followed by a book on the practical experience of Christ (Philippians), and it leads to Christ, the Head (Colossians). Thus, these four books are the heart of the New Testament revelation concerning God's eternal economy.</note>
        <note num="2">Paul was made an apostle of Christ not by man but through the will of God, according to God's economy. This standing gave him authority to put forth in this Epistle the revelation of God's eternal purpose concerning the church. The church is built on this revelation ([link]2:20[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">Lit., well spoken of; i.e., praised with adoration. In this section the Triune God is well spoken of, praised with adoration: the Father in His selection and predestination for God's eternal purpose ([link]vv. 3-6[/link]), the Son in His redemption for the accomplishment of God's eternal purpose ([link]vv. 7-12[/link]), and the Spirit in His sealing and pledging for the application of God's accomplished purpose ([link]vv. 13-14[/link]). Through all the virtues of the Divine Trinity, we, the fallen sinners, become the church, the Body of Christ, the fullness, the expression, of the One who fills all in all.</note>

        <note num="5">Lit., in.</note>
        <note num="6">All the blessings with which God has blessed us, being spiritual, are related to the Holy Spirit. The Spirit of God is not only the channel but also the reality of God's blessings. In this verse God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit are all related to the blessings bestowed on us. God's blessing us is actually His dispensing Himself into us.</note>
        <note num="7">Lit., good speech, or, utterance, well speaking, fair speech; implying bounty and benefit. God has blessed us with His good, fine, and fair speakings. Every such speaking is a blessing to us. [link]Verses 4-14[/link] are an account of such speakings, such blessings. All these blessings are spiritual, in the heavenlies, and in Christ.</note>
        <note num="8">[i]Heavenlies[/i] here indicates not only the heavenly place but also the heavenly nature, state, characteristic, and atmosphere of the spiritual blessings with which God has blessed us. These blessings are from the heavens, having a heavenly nature, heavenly state, heavenly characteristic, and heavenly atmosphere. The believers in Christ are enjoying on earth these heavenly blessings, which are spiritual as well as heavenly. They are different from the blessings with which God blessed Israel. Those blessings were physical and earthly. The blessings bestowed on us are of God the Father, in God the Son, through God the Spirit, and in the heavenlies. They are the spiritual blessings bestowed by the Triune God on us, the believers in Christ. They are the blessings in the heavenlies, having a heavenly nature, state, character, and atmosphere.</note>
        <note num="9">Christ is the virtue, the instrument, and the sphere in which God has blessed us. Outside of Christ, apart from Christ, God has nothing to do with us; but in Christ He has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies.</note>

        <note num="1">After [link]v. 3[/link], [link]vv. 4-14[/link] present a list of all the spiritual blessings with which God has blessed us, beginning from His choosing us in eternity and reaching to the producing of the Body of Christ to express Himself for eternity. Hence, God's choosing is the first blessing that He bestowed on us. His choosing is His selection. From among numberless people He selected us, and this He did in Christ. Christ was the sphere in which we were selected by God. Outside of Christ we are not God's choice.</note>
        <note num="2">This was in eternity past. Before He created us, God chose us according to His infinite foresight. This implies that the world, which is the universe, was founded for man's existence to fulfill God's eternal purpose.[br][br]The book of Romans begins with fallen men on earth; Ephesians begins with God's chosen ones in the heavenlies.</note>
        <note num="3">[i]Holy[/i] means not only sanctified, separated unto God, but also different, distinct, from everything that is common. Only God is different, distinct, from all things. Hence, He is holy; holiness is His nature. He chose us that we should be holy. He makes us holy by imparting Himself, the Holy One, into our being, that our whole being may be permeated and saturated with His holy nature. For us, God's chosen ones, to be holy is to partake of God's divine nature ([link]2 Pet. 1:4[/link]) and to have our whole being permeated with God Himself. This is different from mere sinless perfection or sinless purity. This makes our being holy in God's nature and character, just like God Himself.</note>
        <note num="4">A blemish is like a foreign particle in a precious gem. God's chosen ones should be saturated with only God Himself, having no foreign particles, such as the fallen natural human element, the flesh, the self, or worldly things. This is to be without blemish, without any mixture, without any element other than God's holy nature. The church, after being thoroughly washed by the water in the word, will be sanctified in such a way ([link]5:26-27[/link]).</note>
        <note num="5">[i]Before Him[/i] indicates that we are holy and without blemish in the eyes of God according to His divine standard. This qualifies us to remain in and enjoy His presence.</note>
        <note num="6">[i]In love[/i] could be joined with the first phrase of [link]v. 5[/link].</note>
        <note num="7">Love here refers to the love with which God loves His chosen ones and His chosen ones love Him. It is in this love, in such a love, that God's chosen ones become holy and without blemish before Him. First, God loved us; then this divine love inspires us to love Him in return. In such a condition and atmosphere of love, we are saturated with God to be holy and without blemish, just as He is.</note>

        <text>[note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]Predestinating us unto [note]2[/note][xref]b[/xref]sonship [note]3[/note]through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the [note]4[/note][xref]c[/xref]good pleasure of His [xref]d[/xref]will,</text>
        <note num="1">Or, marking us out beforehand. Marking out beforehand is the process, whereas predestination is the purpose, which is to determine a destiny beforehand. God selected us before the foundation of the world, marking us out beforehand unto a certain destiny.</note>
        <note num="2">God's marking us out beforehand was to destine us unto sonship. We were predestinated to be sons of God even before we were created. Hence, as God's creatures we need to be regenerated by Him that we may participate in His life to be His sons. Sonship implies having not only the life but also the position of a son. God's marked-out ones have the life to be His sons and the position to inherit Him. To be made holy &amp;#8212; to be sanctified by God by His putting Himself into us and then mingling His nature with us &amp;#8212; is the process, the procedure, whereas to be sons of God is the aim, the goal, and is a matter of our being joined to the Son of God and conformed to a particular form or shape, the very image of the firstborn Son of God ([link]Rom. 8:29[/link]; [link]Col. 1:15[/link]), that our whole being, including our body ([link]Rom. 8:23[/link]), may be "sonized" by God.</note>
        <note num="3">[i]Through Jesus Christ[/i] means through the Son of God, the Redeemer. Through Him we were redeemed to be the sons of God, having the life and position of God's sons.</note>
        <note num="4">This reveals that God has a will, in which is His good pleasure. God predestinated us to be His sons according to His pleasure, according to His heart's delight. Unlike the book of Romans, the book of Ephesians does not speak from the standpoint of man's sinful condition; rather, it speaks from the standpoint of the good pleasure of God's heart. Hence, Ephesians is deeper and higher.</note>

        <note num="1">The praise of the glory of God's grace is the result, the issue, of sonship ([link]v. 5[/link]). God's predestinating us unto sonship is for the praise of His expression in His grace, that is, for the praise of the glory of His grace. Eventually, every positive thing in the universe will praise God for sonship ([link]Rom. 8:19[/link]), thus fulfilling what is spoken in this verse.</note>
        <note num="2">Glory is God expressed ([link]Exo. 40:34[/link]). [i]The glory of His grace[/i] indicates that God's grace, which is Himself as our enjoyment, expresses Him. As we receive grace and enjoy God, we have the sense of glory.</note>
        <note num="3">This puts us into the position of grace that we may be the object of God's grace and favor, that is, that we may enjoy all that God is to us.</note>
        <note num="4">The Beloved is God's beloved Son, in whom He delights ([link]Matt. 3:17[/link]; [link]17:5[/link]). Hence, in gracing us God makes us an object in whom He delights. This is altogether a pleasure to God. In Christ we have been blessed by God with every blessing. In the Beloved we were graced, made the object of God's favor and pleasure. As such an object we enjoy God, and God enjoys us in His grace in His Beloved, who is His delight. In His Beloved we too become His delight.</note>

        <note num="1">We were chosen and predestinated. But after being created, we became fallen. Hence, we need redemption, which God accomplished for us in Christ through His blood. This is another item of God's blessings that He has bestowed on us.</note>
        <note num="2">The forgiveness of our offenses is the redemption through the blood of Christ. Apart from the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sins ([link]Heb. 9:22[/link]). Redemption is what Christ accomplished for our offenses; forgiveness is the application of Christ's accomplishment to our offenses.</note>

What God planned in eternity in His wisdom, He is now executing in time in His prudence.</note>

In His wisdom and prudence He has made this hidden mystery known to us through His revelation in Christ, that is, through Christ's incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</note>
        <note num="3">It was the pleasure of God's heart to make the mystery of His will known to us.</note>
        <note num="4">God's good pleasure was what He purposed in Himself unto the economy of the fullness of the times ([link]v. 10[/link]), indicating that God Himself is the initiation, the origination, and the sphere of His eternal purpose, which nothing can overthrow, for which everything is working, and regarding which He did not take counsel with anyone.</note>

        <note num="1">Or, plan. The Greek word, [i]oikonomia,[/i] means [i]house law, household management or administration,[/i] and derivatively, [i]administrative dispensation,[/i] plan, economy (see note [link]4[sup]3[/sup] in 1 Tim. 1[/link]). The economy that God, according to His desire, planned and purposed in Himself is to head up all things in Christ at the fullness of the times. This is accomplished through the dispensing of the abundant life supply of the Triune God as the life factor into all the members of the church that they may rise up from the death situation and be attached to the Body.</note>
        <note num="2">[i]The times[/i] refers to the ages. The fullness of the times will be when the new heaven and new earth appear after all the dispensations of God in all the ages have been completed. Altogether there are four ages: the age of sin (Adam), the age of the law (Moses), the age of grace (Christ), and the age of the kingdom (the millennium).</note>
        <note num="3">God made Christ the Head over all things ([link]v. 22[/link]). Through all the dispensations of God in all the ages, all things will be headed up in Christ in the new heaven and new earth. That will be God's eternal administration and economy. Thus, the heading up of all things is the issue of all the items covered in [link]vv. 3-9[/link]. [link]Verse 22[/link] reveals further that this heading up is to the church so that the Body of Christ may share in all that is of Christ as the Head, having been rescued from the heap of the universal collapse in death and darkness, which was caused by the rebellion of the angels and the rebellion of man. The believers participate in this heading up by being willing to be headed up in the church life, by growing in life, and by living under Christ's light ([link]John 1:4[/link]; [link]Rev. 21:23-25[/link]). When everything is headed up in Christ, there will be absolute peace and harmony ([link]Isa. 2:4[/link]; [link]11:6[/link]; [link]55:12[/link]; [link]Psa. 96:12-13[/link]), a full rescue out of the collapse. This will begin from the time of the restoration of all things ([link]Acts 3:21[/link]).</note>

Since God is our inheritance, the Holy Spirit is a pledge to us of this inheritance. God gives His Holy Spirit to us not only as a guarantee of our inheritance, securing our heritage, but also as a foretaste of what we will inherit of God, affording us a taste beforehand of the full inheritance. In ancient times the Greek word for [i]pledge[/i] was used in the purchasing of land. The seller gave the purchaser some soil as a sample from the land. Hence, a pledge, according to ancient Greek usage, is also a sample. The Holy Spirit is the sample of what we will inherit of God in full.</note>

The Holy Spirit today is a guarantee, a foretaste, and a sample of our divine inheritance, until our body is transfigured in glory, at which time we will inherit God in full.

        <note num="5">We, God's redeemed ones, the church, are God's possession, which He acquired with the precious blood of Christ ([link]Acts 20:28[/link]).

        <note num="1">Third, the power that God caused to operate in Christ subjected all things under His feet.

        <note num="2">Fourth, God's power that He caused to operate in Christ gave Christ to be Head over all things to the church. Christ's headship over all things is a gift from God to Him. It was through God's surpassingly great power that Christ received the headship in the universe.[br][br]It was as a man, in His humanity with His divinity, that Christ was raised from the dead, was seated in the heavenlies, had all things subjected to Him, and was given to be Head over all things.[br][br]Thus, there are four aspects of the power that operated in Christ: resurrection power ([link]v. 20a[/link]), ascending power ([link]v. 20b[/link]), subjecting power ([link]v. 22a[/link]), and heading-up power ([link]v. 22b[/link]). This fourfold power is transmitted to the church, the Body of the Head.</note>
        <note num="3">[i]To the church[/i] implies a kind of transmission. Whatever Christ, the Head, has attained and obtained is transmitted to the church, His Body. In this transmission the church shares with Christ in all His attainments: the resurrection from the dead, His being seated in His transcendency, the subjection of all things under His feet, and the headship over all things.[br][br][i]Toward us who believe[/i] ([link]v. 19[/link]) and [i]to the church[/i] indicate that the divine power, which includes all that the Triune God has passed through, has been installed into us once for all and is being transmitted into us continually, causing us to enjoy Christ richly and to have the proper church life as His Body, His fullness, the issue of God's blessing mentioned previously.</note>
        <note num="4">Here this book uses the term [i]church[/i] for the first time, pointing out the main subject of this book.

        <text>Which is His [note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]Body, the [note]2[/note][xref]b[/xref]fullness of the One who [note]3[/note][xref]c[/xref]fills all in all.</text>
        <note num="1">The Body of Christ is not an organization but an organism constituted of all the regenerated believers for the expression and activities of the Head. The Body of Christ is the issue of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ, who has come into the church. By means of the ascended Christ's heavenly transmission, we are made one with Him, and thus His Body is produced.</note>
        <note num="2">The Body of Christ is His fullness. The fullness of Christ issues from the enjoyment of the riches of Christ ([link]3:8[/link]). Through the enjoyment of Christ's riches, we become His fullness to express Him.</note>
        <note num="3">Christ, who is the infinite God without any limitation, is so great that He fills all things in all things. Such a great Christ needs the church to be His fullness for His complete expression.[br][br]In this chapter there are seven crucial things requiring the same basic factor for their accomplishment: God's selection that we should be made holy and without blemish ([link]v. 4[/link]); God's predestination that we may become His sons ([link]v. 5[/link]); the sealing of the Holy Spirit that we may be fully redeemed ([link]vv. 13-14[/link]); the hope of God's calling; the glory of God's inheritance in the saints ([link]v. 18[/link]); God's power that causes us to participate in Christ's attainment ([link]vv. 19-22[/link]); and the Body of Christ, the fullness of the all-filling Christ. All these are accomplished by the Triune God being dispensed and wrought into our being. The issue of such a divine dispensing into our humanity is the fullness of the One who fills all in all and the praise of God's expressed glory. Actually, this chapter is a revelation of God's marvelous and excellent economy, from His choosing of us in eternity to the producing of the Body of Christ to express Himself for eternity.</note>

        <note num="1">In comparison with the book of Romans, the book of Ephesians does not consider us sinners; it considers us dead persons. As sinners, we need God's forgiveness and justification, as revealed in the book of Romans. But as dead persons, we need to be made alive. Forgiveness and justification bring us back to God's presence to enjoy His grace and participate in His life, whereas being made alive causes us, the living members of the Body of Christ, to express Him. God made us alive by imparting His eternal life, which is Christ Himself ([link]Col. 3:4[/link]), into our dead spirit through His Spirit of life ([link]Rom. 8:2[/link]). He has enlivened us together with Christ.</note>

Then God came in to call a race &amp;#8212; Abraham and his descendants &amp;#8212; out of fallen mankind. For the accomplishing of His purpose, God commanded them to be circumcised, that is, to put away their flesh. This meant that they were separated from fallen mankind and delivered out of the fallen condition. Circumcision made a tremendous distinction between them and the rest of mankind. The circumcised people were called "the circumcision," those who were separated from the fallen situation. The rest of mankind was called "the uncircumcision," those who remained in the fallen state.

        <note num="1">Christ broke down the middle wall of partition between the Jews and the Gentiles by abolishing the law of the commandments in ordinances. When He was crucified on the cross, all the ordinances were nailed there ([link]Col. 2:14[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">Because mankind became flesh ([link]Gen. 6:3[/link]) and was therefore kept from God and His purpose, God ordained that His chosen people be circumcised, that they put away the flesh. The ordinance of circumcision was instituted because of man's flesh. It was in the flesh that Christ was crucified. When He was crucified, His flesh, which was typified by the veil separating the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies in the temple, was rent ([link]Heb. 10:20[/link]).</note>
        <note num="3">This is not the law of the moral commandments but the law of the ritual commandments, composed principally of the practice of circumcision, the observance of dietary regulations, and the keeping of the Sabbath. These ordinances were the main "columns" of Judaism. The moral commandments will never be abolished, but the ritual commandments were in force only during a particular time dispensationally and are therefore not permanent.</note>
        <note num="4">I.e., rituals, the forms or ways of living and worship, which create enmity and division. To practice the proper church life, all ordinances should be repudiated and dropped.</note>
        <note num="5">Christ created the one new man, the church, by working God's divine nature into humanity. The working of the divine nature into humanity was something new. Hence, it was a creating. In the old creation God did not work His nature into any of His creatures, not even into man. In the creating of the one new man, however, God's nature was wrought into man to make His divine nature one entity with humanity.</note>
        <note num="6">Christ is not only the Creator of the one new man, the church, but also the sphere in which and the means by which the one new man was created. He is the very element of the new man, making God's divine nature one entity with humanity. The Greek word rendered [i]in[/i] here can also have an elemental significance, meaning also [i]with,[/i] implying that the new man was created with Christ as its divine essence.</note>
        <note num="7">The Jews and the Gentiles were separated to the uttermost by the separating ordinances. But both were created in Christ with the divine essence into one new entity, which is a corporate man, the church.</note>
        <note num="8">The church is not only the church of God, the Body of Christ (the fullness, the expression, of the all-filling One &amp;#8212; [link]1:23[/link]), and the household or family, the house, the temple, and the dwelling place of God ([link]2:19[/link], [link]21-22[/link]); it is also the one new man, which is corporate and universal, created of two peoples, the Jews and the Gentiles, and composed of all the believers, who, though they are many, are one new man in the universe.[br][br]God created man as a collective entity ([link]Gen. 1:26[/link]). The corporate man created by God was damaged through man's fall; hence, there was the need for God to produce a new man. This was accomplished through Christ's abolishing in His flesh the ordinances and through His creating of the new man in Himself.</note>
        <note num="9">By Christ's abolishing in His flesh the separating ordinances, that is, His slaying the enmity, and by His creating the Jewish and the Gentile believers into one new man, peace was made between all believers.</note>

        <note num="2">The foundation of the church is Christ ([link]1 Cor. 3:11[/link]).

After unveiling in [link]chs. 1[/link] and [link book="Eph."]2[/link] God's blessings to the church and what the church is and how it is produced, the apostle began, from this chapter, to beseech the saints to walk according to his revelation in a way worthy of God's calling. In order that the church might be constituted and realized in a practical, experiential way, he presented himself as a steward ([link]v. 2[/link]), as one who had received grace ([link]v. 2[/link]) and revelation ([link]vv. 3[/link], [link]5[/link]) and had become a minister of the high gospel, announcing the riches of Christ as the gospel for the producing of the church.</note>
        <note num="2">The apostle Paul considered himself a prisoner of Christ. Apparently, he was confined in prison; actually, he was imprisoned in Christ. On the basis of such a status, the status in which he actually lived, he besought the saints. In releasing in [link]chs. 1[/link] and [link book="Eph."]2[/link] the revelation of God's mystery concerning the church, Paul assumed his status as an apostle of Christ through the will of God. That status was the basis of the authority of his revelation concerning the church. In beseeching the saints to walk worthily of God's calling, he used his status as a prisoner of the Lord. His status as an apostle of Christ qualified him to release God's revelation, whereas his status as a prisoner of the Lord spoke forth his walk in the Lord, by which he could inspire and beseech the saints to walk in the Lord as he did. If we enjoy Christ as our prison, we too will walk in the Lord for the constituting of the church.</note>

The stewardship of the grace is for the dispensing of the grace of God to His chosen people for the producing and building up of the church.

Yet, as to the grace he received, he was less than the least of all saints. This implies that all the saints can receive the grace that he received. This is similar to the receiving of the same lifeblood by all the members of our physical body, however small they may be. But the ability (gift) that comes out of the lifeblood differs among the members. All the members of the Body of Christ can have the same grace of life that Paul had, but their gifts are not the same as Paul's.</note>

When the riches of God are in God Himself, they are His riches. But when the riches of God are expressed, they become His fullness ([link]John 1:16[/link]). All the fullness of God dwells in Christ ([link]Col. 1:19[/link]; [link]2:9[/link]). Through His indwelling, Christ imparts the fullness of God into our being that we may be filled even unto the fullness of God to be the practical manifestation of the church, in which God may be glorified in His expression ([link]v. 21[/link]).</note>
        <note num="3">In the New Testament the fullness is the expression through the completeness of the riches. This is the reason that in [link]v. 8[/link] Paul speaks of the unsearchable riches of Christ and that in [link]1:23[/link] and then in [link]4:13[/link] he speaks of the fullness of Christ. The riches of Christ are all that Christ is and has and all that He has accomplished, attained, and obtained. The fullness of Christ is the result and issue of our enjoyment of these riches. When the riches of Christ are assimilated into our being metabolically, they constitute us to be the fullness of Christ, the Body of Christ, the church, as His expression. First, in [link]1:23[/link] this expression is the fullness of Christ, and then in this verse it is the fullness of God, for the fullness of Christ, the embodiment of God, is the very fullness of the Triune God.</note>

        <note num="1">[link]Verses 16-19[/link] are the apostle's prayer. The word but makes [link]vv. 20-21[/link] a doxology. In his prayer the apostle prayed that the Father would strengthen the saints according to the riches of His glory. This implies that the glory of God can be wrought into the saints. In the doxology he said, "To Him be the glory" ([link]v. 21[/link]), implying that the glory of God, which has been wrought into the saints, returns to God. First, the glory of God is wrought into us; then it returns to God for His glorification. Isaac's wealth was first given to Rebekah for her beautification; then all the wealth came back to Isaac, with Rebekah, for his glorification ([link]Gen. 24:47[/link], [link]53[/link], [link]61-67[/link]). The apostle prayed that God would strengthen the saints according to His glory, "but" eventually God's glory, after being wrought into them, returns to Him along with the strengthened saints. This is the way in which God is glorified in the church.</note>
        <note num="2">Strictly, [i]ask or think[/i] here is in regard to the spiritual things related to the church, not in regard to material things. Concerning these spiritual things, we need to think as well as to ask. We might think more than we ask.

By means of this two-way traffic the church, as the firstfruits in the universe ([link]James 1:18[/link]), takes the lead to give glory to God. All the other families both in heaven and on earth will follow the church to glorify Him.</note>

        <note num="4">In the church the sphere of God's glorification is narrow, being limited to the household of the faith.

The basic charge is that we should walk worthily of God's calling, which is the totality of the blessings bestowed on the church, as revealed in [link]1:3-14[/link]. In the church, under the Triune God's abundant blessing, the saints should walk worthily of the Father's selection and predestination, the Son's redemption, and the Spirit's sealing and pledging. Hence, in [link]chs. 4-6[/link] we see, on the one hand, the living that the church should have, and, on the other hand, the responsibility that the church should bear.</note>

The fact that the virtues are mentioned here, before the oneness of the Spirit in [link]v. 3[/link], indicates that we must have these virtues in order to keep the oneness of the Spirit. This implies that in the uniting Spirit there is the transformed humanity, the humanity transformed by the resurrection life of Christ.</note>

        <note num="2">To walk worthily of God's calling, to have the proper Body life, we first need to care for the oneness. This is crucial and vital to the Body of Christ. Strictly, oneness differs from unity. Unity is the state in which many people are united together, whereas oneness is the one entity of the Spirit within the believers, which makes them all one. This oneness is a person, Christ Himself, who is the Spirit dwelling within us. It is similar to the electricity flowing within many lamps, making them all one in the shining. In themselves, the lamps are separate, but in the electricity they are one.</note>
        <note num="3">Christ abolished on the cross all the differences that were due to ordinances. In so doing He made peace for His Body. This peace should bind all believers together and should thus become the uniting bond. The uniting bond of peace is the issue of the working of the cross. When we remain on the cross, we have peace with others. This peace becomes the uniting bond in which we keep the oneness of the Spirit.</note>

        <note num="1">In exhorting us to safeguard the oneness, the apostle pointed out seven things that form the base of our oneness: one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God. These seven "ones" are of three groups. The first three form the first group, that of the Spirit with the Body as His expression. This Body, having been regenerated and being saturated with the Spirit as its essence, has the hope of being transfigured into the full likeness of Christ. The next three form the second group, that of the Lord with faith and baptism that we may be joined to Him. The last of the seven forms the third group, the one God and Father, who is the Originator and source of all. The Spirit as the Executor of the Body, the Son as the Creator of the Body, and God the Father as the Originator of the Body &amp;#8212; all the three of the Triune God &amp;#8212; are related to the Body. The Third of the Trinity is the first mentioned in [link]vv. 4-6[/link] because the main concern here is the Body, of which the Spirit is the essence and the life and life supply. The course is then traced back to the Son and to the Father.</note>

In the Gospel of John it is the Son into whom we believe ([link]John 3:16[/link]), but in the Acts it is the Lord into whom we believe ([link]Acts 16:31[/link]). In the Epistles of John, the Son is for the imparting of life ([link]1 John 5:12[/link]), whereas in the Acts, the Lord, after His ascension, is for the exercising of authority ([link]Acts 2:36[/link]), a matter which concerns His headship. Hence, our believing in Him is related to both life and authority, for He is both our life and our Head. As the Head of the Body ([link]1:22[/link]), He is the Lord. Christians are divided because they neglect the Head; that is, they neglect the Lord's headship and authority.</note>

Through faith and baptism we have been transferred out of Adam into Christ, thereby being joined to the Lord ([link]1 Cor. 6:17[/link]).

[i]Vanquished foes[/i] may refer to Satan, to his angels, and to us the sinners, again indicating Christ's victory over Satan, sin, and death.

In this corporate new man Christ is all and in all &amp;#8212; He is all the people and in all the people. See note [link]11[sup]9[/sup] in Col. 3[/link].[br][br]This book reveals first that the church is the Body of Christ ([link]1:22-23[/link]), the kingdom of God, the household of God ([link]2:19[/link]), and the temple, the dwelling place of God ([link]2:21-22[/link]). Here it reveals in addition that the church is the new man. This is the highest aspect of the church. The church is an assembly of the called-out ones. This is the initial aspect of the church. From here, the apostle went on to mention the fellow citizens of the kingdom of God and the members of the household of God. These are higher than the initial aspect, but not as high as the church as the Body of Christ. Yet the new man is higher still than the Body of Christ. Thus, the church is not just an assembly of believers, a kingdom of heavenly citizens, a household of God's children, or even a Body for Christ. It is in its ultimate, uttermost aspect a new man to accomplish God's eternal purpose. As the Body of Christ, the church needs Christ as its life, whereas as the new man, the church needs Christ as its person. This new corporate person should live a life like that which Jesus lived on earth, that is, a life of reality that expresses God and causes God to be realized as the reality by man. Hence, the new man is the focus of the apostle's exhortation in this section ([link]vv. 17-32[/link]).</note>
        <note num="3">The old man was created outwardly according to the image of God but without God's life and nature ([link]Gen. 1:26-27[/link]), whereas the new man was created inwardly according to God Himself and with God's life and nature ([link]Col. 3:10[/link]).</note>
        <note num="4">Righteousness is to be right with God and with man according to God's righteous way, while holiness is godliness and devoutness before God (see note [link]75[sup]1[/sup] in Luke 1[/link]). Righteousness is mainly toward men, and holiness is mainly toward God.</note>
        <note num="5">The article here is emphatic. As the deceit in [link]v. 22[/link], related to the old man, is the personification of Satan, so the reality here, related to the new man, is the personification of God. The deceit is the devil, and the reality is God. This reality was exhibited in the life of Jesus, as mentioned in [link]v. 21[/link]. In the life of Jesus, righteousness and holiness of the reality were continuously manifested. It was in the righteousness and holiness of this reality, which is God realized and expressed, that the new man was created.</note>

Grace is the expression of love, and love is the source of grace. Truth is the revelation of light, and light is the origin of truth. God is love and God is light ([link]1 John 4:8[/link]; [link]1:5[/link]). When God is expressed and revealed in the Lord Jesus, His love becomes grace and His light becomes truth. After we have, in the Lord, received God as grace and realized Him as truth, we come to Him and enjoy His love and light. Love and light are deeper than grace and truth. Hence, the apostle first took grace and truth as the basic elements for his exhortation, and then love and light. This implies that he wanted our daily walk to grow deeper, to progress from the outward elements to the inward.[br][br]Love is the inner substance of God, whereas light is the expressed element of God. The inward love of God is sensible, and the outward light of God is visible. Our walk in love should be constituted of both the loving substance and the shining element of God. These should be the inner source of our walk. They are deeper than grace and truth.</note>
        <note num="2">In [link]4:32[/link] the apostle presented God as the pattern of our daily walk. Here he set forth Christ as the example of our living. In [link]4:32[/link] God in Christ is our pattern, since in that section God's grace and reality (truth) expressed in the life of Jesus are taken as the basic elements. But here Christ Himself is our example, since in this section love expressed by Christ to us ([link]vv. 2[/link], [link]25[/link]) and light shined by Christ upon us ([link]v. 14[/link]) are taken as the basic elements.</note>

        <note num="1">The thought here is this: although husbands are not the saviors of their wives in the way that Christ is the Savior of the church, wives still need to be subject to their husbands as the church is to Christ.</note>
        <note num="2">According to the divine ordination, the subjection of wives to their husbands should be absolute, without any choice. This does not mean that they should obey their husbands in everything. Obeying is different from being subject. With obedience, the emphasis is on compliance, whereas with subjection, the emphasis is on subordination. In sinful things, things against God and the Lord, wives should not obey their husbands. However, they should still be in subjection to them. In a similar situation, Daniel's three friends disobeyed the Babylonian king's order to worship the idol, yet still subjected themselves to the king's authority ([link]Dan. 3:13-23[/link]).</note>

In married life, the wife's obligation is to be subject and the husband's is to love. The wife's subjection plus the husband's love constitutes a proper married life and typifies the normal church life, in which the church is subject to Christ and Christ loves the church. Love is the very element, the inner substance, of God ([link]1 John 4:8[/link], [link]16[/link]). The goal of this book is to bring us into God's inner substance that we may enjoy God as love and enjoy His presence in the sweetness of the divine love, and thereby love others as Christ did.</note>

        <note num="1">Christ's purpose in giving Himself up for the church is to sanctify her, not only separating her to Himself from everything common but also saturating her with His element that she may be His counterpart. He accomplishes this by cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word.</note>
        <note num="2">Lit., laver. In Greek the definite article is used before this word, causing it to refer to [i]the[/i] laver, the laver that was known to all the Jews. In the Old Testament the priests used the laver to wash away their earthly defilement ([link]Exo. 30:18-21[/link]). Now the laver, the washing of the water, washes us from defilement.</note>
        <note num="3">According to the divine concept, water here refers to the flowing life of God, which is typified by flowing water ([link]Exo. 17:6[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 10:4[/link]; [link]John 7:38-39[/link]; [link]Rev. 21:6[/link]; [link]22:1[/link], [link]17[/link]). The washing of the water here is different from the washing of the redeeming blood of Christ. The redeeming blood washes away our sins ([link]1 John 1:7[/link]; [link]Rev. 7:14[/link]), whereas the water of life washes away the blemishes of the natural life of our old man, such as the "spot or wrinkle or any such things" mentioned in [link]v. 27[/link]. In separating and sanctifying the church, the Lord first washes away our sins with His blood ([link]Heb. 13:12[/link]) and then washes away our natural blemishes with His life. We are now in such a washing process, that the church may be holy and without blemish ([link]v. 27[/link]).</note>
        <note num="4">The Greek word denotes an instant word. The indwelling Christ as the life-giving Spirit is always speaking an instant, present, living word to metabolically cleanse away the old and replace it with the new, causing an inward transformation. The cleansing by the washing of the water of life is in the word of Christ. This indicates that in the word of Christ there is the water of life. This is typified by the laver situated between the altar and the tabernacle ([link]Exo. 38:8[/link]; [link]40:7[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">In the past, Christ as the Redeemer gave Himself up for the church ([link]v. 25[/link]) for redemption and the impartation of life ([link]John 19:34[/link]); in the present, He as the life-giving Spirit is sanctifying the church through separation, saturation, transformation, growth, and building up; and in the future, He as the Bridegroom will present the church to Himself as His counterpart for His satisfaction. Therefore, Christ's loving the church is to separate and sanctify her, and His separating and sanctifying the church are to present her to Himself.</note>
        <note num="2">In this section of exhortation the apostle presented another aspect of the church, that of the bride. This aspect reveals that the church comes out of Christ, as Eve came out of Adam ([link]Gen. 2:21-22[/link]), that it has the same life and nature as Christ, and that it becomes one with Him as His counterpart, as Eve became one flesh with Adam ([link]Gen. 2:24[/link]). The church as the new man is a matter of grace and reality, whereas the church as the bride of Christ is a matter of love and light. The apostle's exhortation in [link]ch. 4[/link] is focused on the new man, which has grace and reality as its basic elements, whereas his exhortation in this chapter is focused on the bride of Christ, which has love and light as its basic substances. In grace and reality we should walk as the new man, and in love and light we should live as the bride of Christ.</note>
        <note num="3">Glory is God expressed. Hence, to be glorious is to be God-expressing. Eventually, the church presented to Christ will be a God-expressing church.</note>

        <note num="1">In exhorting the children and the parents, the apostle dealt with the children first, since trouble comes mostly from the children.[br][br][link]Verses 1-9[/link], which deal with the relationship between children and fathers and between slaves and masters, are inserted between the section on the church as the bride ([link]5:22-33[/link]) and the section on the church as the warrior ([link]vv. 10-20[/link]). If we neglect the points dealt with in [link]vv. 1-9[/link], we cannot be a proper bride or a proper warrior. In the exhortations in these verses, Paul made one key point, which is a very important lesson for us to learn: for the sake of the church life, we need to have a proper human living in this present age.</note>
        <note num="2">[i]In the Lord[/i] indicates that children need to obey their parents (1) by being one with the Lord, (2) not by themselves but by the Lord, and (3) not according to their natural concept but according to the Lord's word.</note>

To be righteous is to be right with both God and man. If we are just a little wrong with either God or man, Satan will accuse us, and there will be holes in our conscience through which all our faith and boldness will leak out. Hence, we need the covering of righteousness to protect us from the enemy's accusation. Such righteousness is Christ ([link]1 Cor. 1:30[/link]).</note>

Christ made peace for us, with both God and man, on the cross, and this peace has become our gospel ([link]2:13-17[/link]). This gospel of peace has been established as a firm foundation, as a readiness with which our feet may be shod. Being thus shod, we will have a firm footing that we may stand to fight the spiritual warfare. The peace for such a firm foundation also is Christ ([link]2:14[/link]).</note>

        <note num="2">We need to have our loins girded with truth, our conscience covered with righteousness, our feet shod with peace, and our entire being protected with the shield of faith. If we live by God as reality (truth), we have righteousness ([link]4:24[/link]), and righteousness issues in peace ([link]Heb. 12:11[/link]; [link]Isa. 32:17[/link]). Having all these, we can easily have faith as a shield against the evil one's flaming darts. Christ is the Author and Perfecter of such faith ([link]Heb. 12:2[/link]). For us to stand firmly in the battle, we need to be equipped with all these four items of God's armor.</note>
        <note num="3">The flaming darts are Satan's temptations, proposals, doubts, questions, lies, and attacks. Flaming darts were used by fighters in the apostle's time. The apostle used this term to illustrate Satan's attacks on us.</note>

        <note num="1">Receiving the helmet of salvation is for covering our mind, our mentality, against the negative thoughts shot in by the evil one. Such a helmet, such a covering, is God's salvation. Satan injects threats, worries, anxieties, and other weakening thoughts into our mind. God's salvation is the covering that we take up against all these. Such a salvation is the saving Christ whom we experience in our daily life ([link]John 16:33[/link]).</note>

        <text>[note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]Peace to the brothers and [note]2[/note][xref]b[/xref]love with faith [note]3[/note]from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</text>
        <note num="1">In the beginning of the book the apostle's greeting is first with grace as the enjoyment and then with peace as the result of the enjoyment ([link]1:2[/link]). But in the conclusion the elements are presented vice versa, progressing from the result, peace, to the enjoyment, grace. After we have come into peace, we still need grace, indicating that our experience is from grace to grace.</note>
        <note num="2">The reason the apostle inserted [i]love[/i] between [i]peace[/i] and [i]grace[/i] is that the only way we can be kept in a situation of peace is by continually enjoying the Lord in love. Paul realized that love is crucial. He spoke of love in relation to peace and grace, indicating thereby that love is needed to preserve us in a condition of peace.[br][br]Love with faith is the means by which we partake of and experience Christ ([link]1 Tim. 1:14[/link]). Faith is for receiving Him ([link]John 1:12[/link]), and love is for enjoying Him ([link]John 14:23[/link]). Here it is not faith and love nor love and faith, but love [i]with[/i] faith. This indicates that we need faith as a match and support for our love. Love with faith is needed. This is the conclusion of the book on the church. The church needs to enjoy Christ in love with faith, which operates through love ([link]Gal. 5:6[/link]). Love comes from God to us, and faith goes from us to God. By means of this traffic of love and faith, peace remains our portion. We are kept in peace by the coming of God's love to us and by the going of our faith to Him. This traffic also keeps us in the continual supply of grace, in the enjoyment of the Lord ([link]v. 24[/link]).</note>
        <note num="3">Love is from God; it originates with God, not with us. Eventually, however, God's love becomes our love. God's love for us becomes our love for Him.</note>

        <note num="1">Grace is needed for us to live a church life that fulfills God's eternal purpose and solves God's problem with His enemy.</note>
        <note num="2">The enjoyment of the Lord as grace is with those who love Him. In this book the phrase [i]in love,[/i] which is rich in feeling, is used repeatedly ([link]1:4[/link]; [link]3:17[/link]; [link]4:2[/link], [link]15-16[/link]; [link]5:2[/link]). Later, the church in Ephesus was rebuked by the Lord because she had lost her first love toward Him ([link]Rev. 2:4[/link]). One of the main points revealed in this book is that the church, which is the Body of Christ, is also the bride of Christ, Christ's wife. With the Body, the emphasis is on taking Christ as life; with the wife, the emphasis is on loving Christ. Therefore, this book emphasizes and also concludes with our love toward the Lord. The church in Ephesus, the recipient of this Epistle, failed in the matter of loving the Lord. Such a failure became the source of and main reason for the failure of the church throughout the ages ([link]Rev. 2-3[/link]).</note>
        <note num="3">For the proper church life we need to love the Lord in incorruptibility, that is, in and according to all the crucial things revealed and taught in the six chapters of this book, such as the church as the Body of Christ, the new man, the economy of God's mystery, the oneness of the Spirit, reality and grace, light and love, and the items of God's armor, all of which are incorruptible. For the sake of the church, our love toward the Lord must be in these incorruptible things.</note>
