        <verse num="1">
        <text>[note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]Blessed is the man / Who does not walk / In the counsel of the wicked, / Nor stand on the path of sinners, / Nor [xref]b[/xref]sit in the seat of mockers;</text>
        <note num="1">Or, Happy. Psalms is not a book of doctrines or of any kind of teaching. It is a book of divine revelation composed of the expressions, sentiments, feelings, impressions, and experiences of godly men concerning (1) God and the way He is in His dealing with them; (2) the law of God as the holy Word with the divine revelation; (3) the house of God, the temple, and Mount Zion, on which the temple was seated, as the center of God's dwelling place on earth; (4) the holy city of God, Jerusalem, as the encompassing protection of the house of God; (5) the holy people of God, Israel, as God's beloved elect among the nations; (6) Israel's love toward God, their fellowship with God, their blessings received of God, their sufferings under God's dealings, and their environment; (7) their captivity; and (8) their thanksgivings and praises to Jehovah their God, whom they tasted and enjoyed. Through the godly expressions of the psalmists Christ is revealed and the church as God's house and God's city is typified.[br][br]The Psalms were written according to two kinds of concepts: the human concept of the holy writers and the divine concept of God. The human concept of the holy writers was produced out of their good nature created by God, formed with the traditions of their holy race, constituted with the teachings of the Holy Scriptures, promoted by their practice of a holy life, and uttered out of their holy sentiments and impressions. The divine concept of God as the divine revelation in the Psalms concerns three major items: (1) God's eternal economy, of which Christ is the centrality and universality; (2) Christ in His divinity, humanity, human living, all-inclusive death, life-imparting and church-producing resurrection, glorification, ascension, appearing in glory, and reigning forever; and (3) God's heart's desire, His good pleasure, in Christ as His centrality and universality, in the church as His fullness for His expression, in the kingdom for His eternal administration, and in the recovery of the earth for His eternal kingdom in eternity. In the Psalms only what is written out of the divine concept of God, and not what is written out of the human concept of the psalmists, should be considered as part of the divine revelation from God concerning His divine economy.[br][br]According to the divine concept, the central thought of the book of Psalms is Christ, as revealed in plain words ([link]Luke 24:44[/link]), and the church as the house of God and the city of God for His kingdom, as typified by the temple and by the city of Jerusalem. The spirit, the reality, the characteristic, of the divine revelation in the book of Psalms is Christ as the centrality and universality of the eternal economy of God. For this, Christ is first the embodiment of the Triune God ([link]Col. 2:9[/link]), then the house, the habitation, of God (signified by the temple &amp;#8212; [link]John 2:19-21[/link]), the kingdom of God (signified by the city of Jerusalem &amp;#8212; [link]Luke 17:21[/link]; [link]Rev. 22:3b[/link]), and the Ruler of the entire earth from the house of God and in the kingdom of God ([link]Dan. 2:34-35[/link]). Thus, He is all in all in the entire universe (cf. [link]Eph. 1:23[/link]; [link]Col. 3:11[/link]). Such a divine revelation is the same as what is revealed in the entire Holy Scriptures. The only particular point related to the divine revelation in the book of Psalms is that such a high revelation, even the highest peak of the divine revelation, is prophesied in the expressions of the sentiments of the ancient godly saints. Thus, it is mixed with their comfort in sufferings and with the cultivation of godliness. The consummation of this highest divine revelation is the city of New Jerusalem as a sign of the habitation, the tabernacle, of God ([link]Rev. 21:1-3[/link]), through which the processed and consummated Triune God will be manifested and expressed in the all-inclusive Christ and will reign on the new earth in the new universe for eternity.</note>

        <note num="1">Psalms 1 and 2 portray a contrast between the human concept and the divine revelation. The human concept exalts the law and the law-keeper as one blessed by God, whereas the divine revelation proclaims Christ as the One anointed of God in God's economy. In Psa. 1 the psalmist, according to his human, ethical concept, appreciated and uplifted the law to the uttermost. This is contrary to the divine concept in God's New Testament economy. In its nature the law is holy, righteous, good, and spiritual ([link]Rom. 7:12[/link], [link]14a[/link]), but in its position, the law is not in the main line of God's economy; rather, it entered in alongside the main line of God's economy ([link]Rom. 5:20a[/link]). God created man in His image and according to His likeness ([link]Gen. 1:26[/link]) with the intention that man would receive God as life in the tree of life ([link]Gen. 2:8-9[/link], [link]16-17[/link]) so that man could live God and express God. This is the main line of God's economy. But while this main line was proceeding, Satan came in to deceive man and constitute man with sin ([link]Gen. 3:1-6[/link]; [link]Rom. 5:19[/link]). In order to continue His purpose with man after man's fall, God added the law to the main line of His economy ([link]Gal. 3:19[/link] and notes 1 and 2). According to [link]Gal. 4:24-25[/link] (see note [link book="Gal." chapter="4"]24[sup]5[/sup][/link] there), the position of the law is that of a concubine. A concubine does not have an orthodox position. Thus, to appreciate and uplift the law is to bring a "concubine" into God's economy. This is absolutely against God's ordination.[br][br]The entire book of Psalms presents a contrast between the law and Christ. Only Christ Himself, not the law, can make us members of Christ and conform us to Christ that we may be His complement ([link]Eph. 5:30-32[/link]; [link]Rom. 8:29[/link]). The spirit of the Scriptures does not exalt anything or anyone other than Christ ([link]Matt. 17:1-5[/link]; [link]Phil. 3:7-8[/link]; [link]Col. 1:15-19[/link]). Eventually, by the end of the Psalms the only thing that remains is Christ with His complement, which is His Body, His church, the house and kingdom of God in God's economy to fulfill God's eternal purpose.[br][br]In the book of Psalms, as in the entire Bible, there are two lines: the line of the tree of life, the line of life, and the line of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the line of death ([link]Gen. 2:8-9[/link], [link]16-17[/link] and note [link chapter="2"]9[sup]3[/sup][/link], par. 2). In addition to these two lines, the line of the law runs alongside the line of life. God's purpose in giving the law was to lead His people to Christ ([link]Gal. 3:23-24[/link]), i.e., to the line of life (see note [link]1[sup]1[/sup] in Exo. 25[/link]). However, if the law as the side line is exalted improperly, it becomes part of the line of the tree of knowledge, the line of death ([link]Rom. 7:7-11[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 3:6b[/link]). God has ordained Christ to be the centrality and universality of His economy to fulfill His good pleasure ([link]Eph. 1:9-10[/link]; [link]3:8-11[/link]). The law has been ended by Christ ([link]Rom. 10:4a[/link]), and the believers are no longer under the law ([link]Rom. 6:14[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">The human concept here is that the man who delights in the law of God prospers in everything, whereas the wicked man suffers loss ([link]vv. 4-5[/link]). But the experience of the psalmist in [link]Psa. 73[/link] was the opposite ([link]73:1-7[/link], [link]12-14[/link]). This seeming contradiction troubled the psalmist until he was instructed, in the sanctuary of God, to take only God Himself as his portion, not anything other than God ([link]73:16-17[/link], [link]25-26[/link]). According to the Lord's teaching in the New Testament, those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness (not those who are prosperous) are blessed ([link]Matt. 5:10[/link]). In his pursuing of Christ, the apostle Paul did not prosper outwardly but suffered the loss of all things and counted them as refuse that he might gain Christ ([link]Phil. 3:8[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">[link]Psalm 1[/link], concerning the law in man's appreciation, is for the personal benefit of the saints, such as their being blessed in prosperity ([link]1:1-3[/link]). Psalm 2, concerning Christ and His attainments, is for the accomplishing of God's economy. The human concept of the holy writers uplifts the law to the extent that they treasured the law and desired to remain in it for their whole life. The divine concept of the unveiling God exalts Christ in order to turn the holy writers' concept from the law to Christ in accordance with the divine concept of the divine revelation.</note>

He came in His incarnation as the anointed One to accomplish God's eternal plan ([link]Luke 2:11[/link]; [link]Matt. 1:16[/link]; [link]16:16[/link]).

In His resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit ([link]1 Cor. 15:45[/link]) for the purpose of being God's Anointed, and in His ascension He was made both Lord and Christ ([link]Acts 2:36[/link]), becoming God's Anointed in an official way to carry out God's commission, mainly in His heavenly ministry.

        <note num="1">[link]Verses 4-6[/link] of this psalm are God's declaration concerning Christ. In His ascension Christ was installed, enthroned, as God's King in the heavens for God's kingdom to fulfill His economy ([link]Mark 16:19[/link]; [link]Acts 2:36[/link]; [link]5:31[/link]; [link]Rev. 1:5a[/link]). This kingdom includes all the nations as Christ's inheritance and the limits of the earth as Christ's possession ([link]v. 8[/link]; [link]Matt. 28:18-20[/link]). Eventually, in His universal kingdom Christ will rule the nations with an iron rod ([link]v. 9[/link]; [link]Rev. 19:15[/link]).[br][br]This psalm reveals the steps of Christ in God's economy, beginning from His being anointed in eternity in His divinity ([link]v. 2[/link]) and continuing with His resurrection (implying His death also &amp;#8212; [link]v. 7[/link]; cf. [link]Acts 13:33[/link]), His ascension ([link]v. 6[/link]), His setting up His universal kingdom ([link]Rev. 11:15[/link]) with the nations as His inheritance and the ends of the earth as His possession ([link]v. 8[/link]), and His ruling the nations with an iron rod ([link]v. 9[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">God proclaimed that He had installed His King on Mount Zion, not Mount Sinai. Mount Sinai was the place where the law was given, and Mount Zion in the heavens is the place where Christ is today in His ascension ([link]Rev. 14:1[/link]). The New Testament believers have come not to Mount Sinai but to Mount Zion ([link]Heb. 12:18-22[/link]). Mount Sinai produces children of slavery under the law, but our mother, the Jerusalem above, which is in the heavens at Mount Zion, produces children of promise who inherit the promised blessing &amp;#8212; the all-inclusive Spirit ([link]Gal. 4:24-26[/link], [link]28[/link]; [link]3:14[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">Psalms 3-7 show David's concept concerning a godly life. Psalms 3 and 7, and probably 4-6, were written by David in his flight from his son Absalom's rebellion ([link]2 Sam. 15:1-19:8a[/link]), which was the outcome, under God's chastisement, of David's sin of murdering Uriah and robbing him of his wife ([link]2 Sam. 11[/link]). David's prayers in these psalms, concerning his sufferings, his desire to be avenged of his adversaries, his condemning of others, and his self-righteousness and integrity, are according to his human concept and for his personal interest. They cannot compare with the spiritual prayers of the apostle Paul in [link]Eph. 1:15-23[/link] and [link]3:14-21[/link], which are for the fulfillment of God's economy.</note>

        <note num="1">David's prayer for vengeance against his enemies is contrary to the New Testament, which teaches us to love our enemies and to bless those who persecute us and pray for them ([link]Matt. 5:44[/link]; [link]Luke 6:27[/link], [link]35[/link]; [link]Rom. 12:14[/link], [link]20[/link]). In the Psalms the words concerning the psalmists' hating their enemies, their asking God to avenge them, and their cursing others are not the words of God but are words that issued from the psalmists' natural sentiment while they were praising God. They are recorded by the Spirit of God in the Holy Scripture to serve God's purpose of exposing the psalmists' spiritual condition, i.e., that although the psalmists loved God and sought Him, they were natural, not spiritual, in their sentiment.</note>

        <note num="1">In this psalm David felt that he had done no wrong, and he asked God to judge him according to his righteousness and his integrity ([link]v. 8[/link]). This shows that David had not been enlightened and convicted by God concerning his own sinfulness (cf. [link]Psa. 51[/link]; [link]Isa. 64:6[/link]; [link]Rom. 7:18[/link]; [link]Luke 18:9-14[/link]; [link]1 Tim. 1:15[/link]).[br][br]Like the book of Job, many of the psalms give us the impression that we need to be godly, to fear God and trust in Him, to keep the law, to maintain our integrity, and to be righteous, upright, just, and perfect (cf. note [link]1[sup]4[/sup], par. 1, in Job 1[/link]). Such a concept, however, is not according to the divine revelation of the New Testament; it is altogether the concept of the Old Testament under the law according to the knowledge of good and evil. The New Testament reveals that we have been crucified with Christ ([link]Gal. 2:20[/link]) and buried with Him ([link]Rom. 6:4[/link]). Death has liberated us from the law ([link]Rom. 7:1-6[/link]; [link]Gal. 2:19[/link]). Now we should simply receive Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, and let Him live in us, no longer caring for our righteousness, justice, or integrity but caring only for Christ, the living One ([link]Phil. 3:6b-9[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">Signifying the people of the kingdom of the heavens, who are like little children ([link]Matt. 18:3[/link]; [link]19:14[/link]). The Lord's salvation, including His redemption, regeneration, sanctification, renewing, and transformation, stops all our natural, human activity and makes us babes and sucklings to praise Him.</note>
        <note num="2">The Septuagint translates, perfected praise (cf. [link]Matt. 21:16[/link]).</note>
        <note num="3">Signifying Satan, who is God's adversary within God's kingdom, God's enemy outside God's kingdom, and the avenger who roves to and fro over the earth (cf. [link]Job 1:7[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 5:8[/link]). Above the heavens is God's splendor, and on the earth is the excellent name of Jesus; but between the earth and heavens are the adversary, the enemy, and the avenger ([link]Eph. 2:2[/link]; [link]6:12[/link]). The Lord stops these three categories of negative ones by establishing strength and perfecting praise out of the mouths of babes and sucklings, the youngest, smallest, and weakest ones. In this psalm the perfected praise includes the praise for the Lord's glory above the heavens, His excellency on the earth ([link]v. 1[/link]), and His incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, ascension, and coming kingdom ([link]vv. 4-8[/link]). To praise the Lord in such a perfected way requires strength. The highest consummation of the Lord's work in His redemption is to strengthen the weakest and smallest ones and perfect the praise they offer to Him out of their mouths.</note>

Christ's all-inclusive death ([link]Heb. 2:9[/link]), which preceded His resurrection and ascension, is implied.[br][br]This verse portrays all the steps of the Triune God's process in Christ: incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension.

        <note num="1">This psalm combined with [link]Psa. 10[/link] is one of the alphabetical, or acrostic, psalms. In the acrostic psalms the first letters of each verse, or sometimes of each line of poetry, follow the order of the Hebrew alphabet.</note>

        <text>When my [note]1[/note]enemies turn back, / They stumble and perish at Your presence.</text>
        <note num="1">This psalm expresses David's concept concerning God's judgment on his enemies among the nations, and in [link]Psa. 10-14[/link] David speaks of man's condition before God. David's concept in these six psalms is according to the law given by God (see note [link]2[sup]1[/sup] in Psa. 1[/link]) and is based on the principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil ([link]Gen. 2:9[/link]). Nothing in these psalms is related to God's economy, to God's interest, to God's kingdom, or to God's plan. Everything is concerning David's personal benefit, personal interest, personal safety, and personal peace. The New Testament believers, who live by Christ as the tree of life for the carrying out of God's economy, should not take David here as a model.</note>

        <verse num="4">
        <text>For You have upheld my right and my cause; / You sit on the throne, [note]1[/note]judging righteously.</text>
        <note num="1">David's thought here and in [link]vv. 7-8[/link] is that God sits as the King on the throne only to judge the world in righteousness and with equity, i.e., with justice. His concept is according to the law and according to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. In contrast, the principal concept of the New Testament is that Christ rules the world to save the world in mercy and grace ([link]Acts 5:31[/link] and note 2). In the New Testament God's throne is mainly the throne of grace ([link]Heb. 4:16[/link]), the throne of a loving Savior, not the throne of judgment. From eternity to eternity God's intention is to love the world, which is composed of fallen men, and to favor man with His mercy and grace ([link]Hosea 6:6[/link], cf. [link]Matt. 9:13[/link]; [link]John 3:16[/link]; [link]1 Tim. 2:3-4[/link]; [link]Titus 3:4-7[/link]). Of course, the New Testament also reveals that God's throne is the throne of God's authority and that God will judge His own people and the world in His righteousness ([link]2 Tim. 4:8[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 4:17[/link]; [link]Rom. 3:19[/link]; [link]Rev. 4:2[/link]; [link]6:12-20:15[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">Psalms 15 and 16 are a pair showing a comparison between the keeping of the law and the participation in Christ. Psalm 15 is full of the concept of good and evil, whereas in Psa. 16 Christ, the person, replaces good and evil.</note>

        <note num="1">According to [link]vv. 2-5[/link], David's concept was that the man who is perfect according to the law may dwell with God for His heart's desire and good pleasure. Thus, [link]v. 5[/link] says that he who does the good things of the law will not be shaken forever (cf. [link]16:8[/link]). However, [link]Psa. 16[/link] reveals that only Christ, the God-man, can satisfy God's desire and fulfill His good pleasure ([link]Matt. 3:17[/link]; [link]17:5[/link]). Only He &amp;#8212; the very God who became a man, lived a human life full of the divine attributes expressed in human virtues, died, resurrected, and ascended to the right hand of God &amp;#8212; is perfect according to the law and can sojourn in God's tabernacle and dwell with God on His holy mountain. In God's economy only the God-man Christ as the firstborn Son of God with His many brothers as the many sons of God ([link]Rom. 8:29[/link]) can satisfy God's desire and fulfill His good pleasure.</note>

        <note num="1">David's prayer in [link]vv. 12-14[/link] indicates that David was endeavoring to keep the law to the extent of being dealt with in his secret faults, in his presumptuous sins, in the words of his mouth, and in the meditation of his heart. However, even if David could have been perfect, this would not have pleased God. According to the entire principle of the Bible, God does not want anything merely from man. Regardless of how good a thing is, as long as it is merely human, God will put it aside. What God wants is not a good man, or even a perfect man, but a God-man. God's desire was to be incarnated as a man by the name of Jesus, to die on the cross, to be resurrected, and in resurrection to become a life-giving Spirit ([link]1 Cor. 15:45b[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 3:6[/link], [link]17a[/link]) to indwell us ([link]Rom. 8:11[/link]), to live in us ([link]Gal. 2:20[/link]), and to live Himself out of us ([link]Phil. 1:21a[/link]). This psalm should be evaluated in view of the entire principle of the Bible, which is that God's main purpose is to make Himself one with man and to make man one with Him, that He and man may have one life, one nature, and one living. Those who are one with God are God's organism, the Body of Christ, which will consummate in the holy city, New Jerusalem ([link]Rev. 21:2-22:5[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">Psalms 22-24 are a group of psalms revealing Christ from His crucifixion to His kingship in the coming age. Psalm 22 concerns Christ's death, His resurrection, and His many brothers produced in His resurrection to form His church. [link]Psalm 23[/link] concerns Christ as the Shepherd in His resurrection. [link]Psalm 24[/link] concerns Christ as the coming King in God's kingdom.[br][br]The subject of Psa. 22 is the Christ who passed through the redeeming death and entered into the church-producing resurrection. [link]Verses 1-21[/link] give a detailed picture of Christ in His suffering of death (cf. [link]Isa. 53[/link]), as typified by David in his suffering, and [link]vv. 22-31[/link] refer to Christ in His resurrection, as typified by Solomon in his kingly reign.</note>
        <note num="2">The question at the beginning of this psalm was spoken by David in his suffering, but it became a prophecy concerning Christ in His suffering of His redeeming death. While Christ was on the earth, God the Father was with Him all the time ([link]John 8:29[/link]), but at a certain point in His crucifixion, God left Him ([link]Matt. 27:45-46[/link]). God's leaving Him was economical, not essential. God could never leave Christ essentially, but economically God forsook Him for a time. Nevertheless, Christ died as the Son of God, a God-man; hence, in His death there is a divine and eternal element ([link]Acts 20:28[/link]; [link]1 John 1:7[/link]; [link]Heb. 9:12[/link]). See notes [link]22[sup]1[/sup] in Luke 3[/link], [link book="Matt." chapter="27"]45[sup]1[/sup][/link] and [link]46[sup]2[/sup] in Matt. 27[/link], and [link]7[sup]4[/sup], par. 1, in 1 John 1[/link].</note>

        <note num="1">In the third stage of His shepherding, we experience the presence of the resurrected pneumatic Christ as we walk through the valley of the shadow of death, i.e., through the troubles and sufferings of life. When we walk through the valley, we do not fear any evil, for the pneumatic Christ is with us ([link]Matt. 28:20b[/link]; [link]2 Tim. 4:22[/link]). His presence is a comfort, a rescue, and a sustaining power to us. When we are in the valley, we should simply remain there and rest in the Lord. Our resting in the Lord will shorten the valley, reduce the shadow, and remove the death.</note>
        <note num="2">The rod is for protection, and the staff is for training, for guidance, and also for sustenance. In the valley of the shadow of death, the Lord's protection, guidance, and sustenance comfort us.</note>

        <note num="1">In the fourth stage of His shepherding, in the deeper and higher enjoyment of the resurrected Christ, the Lord spreads a table, a feast (Christ with His riches for our enjoyment), before us in the presence of our adversaries. If we fight the spiritual battle and defeat the adversaries, we will have a rich enjoyment of the Lord as our feast at His table (cf. [link]Gen. 14:17-18[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">The Hebrew word refers to the anointing done at a festal banquet. In the fourth stage of His shepherding, the Lord anoints our head with oil (the oil of exultant joy &amp;#8212; [link]Heb. 1:9[/link]), signifying the compound Spirit as the compound ointment ([link]Exo. 30:23-26[/link] and notes [link]25[sup]1[/sup][/link] and [link]26[sup]1[/sup][/link]). To anoint the head is to anoint the whole body ([link]133:2[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 1:21[/link]). This is the anointing of the compound, life-giving Spirit in Christ's resurrection ([link]1 John 2:20[/link] and note 1).</note>
        <note num="3">In the fourth stage of Christ's shepherding, our cup (the cup of blessing &amp;#8212; [link]1 Cor. 10:16a[/link]; [link]Matt. 26:27[/link] and note) runs over. In this verse the Triune God is implied &amp;#8212; the Son as the table, the feast ([link]1 Cor. 11:23-26[/link]), the Spirit as the anointing oil ([link]Luke 4:18[/link]), and the Father as the source of the blessing ([link]Eph. 1:3[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">The fifth stage of Christ's shepherding is the lifelong enjoyment of the divine goodness and lovingkindness in the house of Jehovah. Under the organic shepherding of the pneumatic Christ, goodness and lovingkindness follow us "all the days of [our] life," referring to the present age. [i]Goodness[/i] refers to the grace of Christ, [i]lovingkindness[/i] refers to the love of the Father, and [i]follow[/i] implies the fellowship of the Spirit ([link]2 Cor. 13:14[/link]). Eventually, this enjoyment of the processed and consummated Triune God ushers us into the enjoyment of God in the house of God (Christ, the church, and the New Jerusalem &amp;#8212; [link]John 1:14[/link]; [link]2:21[/link]; [link]1 Tim. 3:15-16[/link]; [link]Rev. 21:2-3[/link], [link]22[/link]), where we will dwell "for the length of [our] days," referring to the present age, the coming age, and eternity.</note>

        <note num="1">This psalm is one of the alphabetical, or acrostic, psalms. See note [link]1[sup]1[/sup] in Psa. 9[/link]. [link]Psalms 25-41[/link] show the mixed expressions of the psalmist's sentiments in his enjoyment of God in God's house. The enjoyment of Christ, as portrayed in [link]Psa. 2[/link], [link book="Psa."]8[/link], [link book="Psa."]16[/link], and [link book="Psa."]22-24[/link], led the psalmist to another state of enjoyment &amp;#8212; the enjoyment of God in the house of God. Although God is universal and omnipresent, He has located Himself in His house so that men may contact Him and enjoy Him ([link]23:6[/link]; [link]27:4[/link]). In the Old Testament time God's house, His dwelling place, was both in the heavens ([link]1 Kings 8:30b[/link], [link]39a[/link], [link]43a[/link]) and in the temple on Mount Zion ([link]Psa. 76:2b[/link]; [link]135:21[/link]; [link]Isa. 8:18[/link]). God's physical house in the Old Testament is a type of His spiritual house in the New Testament ([link]1 Pet. 2:5[/link]). God's house in the New Testament is, first, Christ as God's tabernacle and God's temple ([link]John 1:14[/link]; [link]2:21[/link]; [link]Col. 2:9[/link]); second, it is the church, the enlargement of Christ, as God's enlarged temple ([link]1 Cor. 3:16[/link]; [link]Eph. 2:21-22[/link]; [link]1 Tim. 3:15[/link]; [link]Heb. 3:6[/link]). Consummately, God's house will be the New Jerusalem, a composition of God's redeemed as the tabernacle ([link]Rev. 21:2-3[/link]) for God to dwell in and enjoy His redeemed, and the redeeming God Himself as the temple ([link]Rev. 21:22[/link]) for His redeemed to dwell in and enjoy Him &amp;#8212; a mutual dwelling of both God and man for their mutual enjoyment. We enjoy God in His house by being in Christ and in the church in this age, and ultimately in the New Jerusalem in the next age and in eternity.</note>

In the New Testament, however, the apostle Paul did not complain about his distress (cf. [link]Col. 1:24[/link]).

        <note num="1">In the beginning of this psalm David confessed his sins ([link]vv. 1-5[/link]), but at the end he justified himself as righteous and upright in heart. In reality, apart from Christ no one is righteous and upright in heart ([link]Rom. 3:10[/link]; [link]Jer. 17:9[/link]). David's writing here is that of a person who tried to keep the law apart from Christ. In His economy God does not want us to endeavor to keep the law. He wants us to live Christ, the God-man, that He may be magnified ([link]Phil. 1:19-21a[/link]). To live Christ in order to magnify Him is to enjoy Him.</note>

        <note num="1">Figuratively, [i]fatness[/i] means abundance; specifically, the word refers to the (fatty) ashes of sacrifices (Strong). Thus, the fatness of God's house comes from the sacrifices, the offerings, all of which typify the all-inclusive Christ ([link]Heb. 10:5-10[/link]). The fatness of God's house, therefore, refers to the riches of Christ ([link]Eph. 3:8[/link]). The fatty ashes of the offerings are the signs of Christ's accomplishment through His death (cf. notes [link]12[sup]1[/sup] in Lev. 4[/link] and [link]10[sup]1[/sup] in Lev. 6[/link]).[br][br][link]Verses 8-9[/link] reveal the Divine Trinity in His divine dispensing as the enjoyment of God's people in His house. The fatness refers to Christ, the Son; the river of the divine pleasures, to the Spirit as the river of water of life ([link]John 7:37-39[/link]; [link]Rev. 22:1[/link]); and the fountain of life and light ([link]v. 9[/link]), to the Father as the source of life and light ([link]John 1:4[/link]; [link]1 John 1:5[/link]; [link]Rev. 21:23[/link]; [link]22:1-2[/link], [link]5[/link]). These verses indicate that even in the dispensation of law, before the dispensation of grace in the New Testament age, the seeking saints enjoyed the Triune God in His dwelling place on earth. They indicate further that the entire Bible was written according to the controlling vision that the Triune God is working Himself into His chosen and redeemed people to be their life and life supply in order to saturate their entire being with the Divine Trinity, that is, with the Father as the fountain, the Son as the fatness, and the Spirit as the river.</note>
        <note num="2">The house of God here refers to the temple in the Old Testament, which typifies the church as the Body of Christ in the New Testament (see note [link]2[sup]1[/sup] in John 14[/link]). Ultimately, the house of God will consummate in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth ([link]Rev. 21:3[/link], [link]22[/link]). In the proper church life we enjoy Christ as the fatness, the Spirit as the river, and the Father as the fountain of life and light ([link]v. 9[/link]). This enjoyment leads us ultimately to the enjoyment of the tree of life, the river of water of life, and the light of life in the New Jerusalem ([link]Rev. 22:1-2[/link], [link]5[/link]).</note>

Our realizing that our condition is sinful ([link]Psa. 38[/link]) and our situation is one of vanity opens the way for Christ to crucify us and enter into us to replace us by living Himself through us and causing us to live together with Him in an organic union, as expressed by Paul in [link]Gal. 2:20[/link]. This is the divine concept of God according to the divine revelation of the New Testament.</note>

        <note num="1">The word in [link]vv. 6-8[/link] is actually the word of Christ, as quoted by Paul in [link]Heb. 10:5-7[/link]. The prophecy in [link]vv. 6-8[/link] is one of the greatest revelations concerning the all-inclusive Christ in the commission that God committed to Christ in His first coming through incarnation, which was to put away the animal sacrifices of the old covenant and to establish Himself, in His body, as the sacrifice of the new covenant (see notes [link book="Heb." chapter="10"]7[sup]2[/sup][/link] and [link]9[sup]1[/sup] in Heb. 10[/link]). This is to terminate God's Old Testament economy and to initiate God's New Testament economy, in which Christ replaces all the offerings as well as all things, all matters, and all persons (cf. [link]Matt. 17:4-8[/link]; [link]Col. 2:16-17[/link]; [link]3:10-11[/link]).[br][br]The prophecy in [link]vv. 6-8[/link] concerning Christ is the goal and destination of the revelation of Christ in [link]Psa. 2[/link], [link book="Psa."]8[/link], [link book="Psa."]16[/link], and [link book="Psa."]22-24[/link]. In this prophecy Christ comes through His incarnation to terminate God's old economy and initiate God's new economy, His New Testament economy, by replacing the animal sacrifices and establishing Himself as the unique sacrifice of the new covenant. As such a sacrifice, Christ is the factor that enacts God's New Testament economy ([link]Matt. 26:28[/link]) that He may be its centrality and universality for the producing and building up of the church as His organic Body, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem. Hence, Christ has changed the age for the consummating of God's new creation out of God's old creation ([link]2 Cor. 5:17[/link]; [link]Gal. 6:15[/link]). His changing of the age is greater than the creation of the universe mentioned in [link]Gen. 1[/link].</note>
        <note num="2">A sacrifice is for sin and sins before God, and an offering is for fellowship with God. These two things were the elements upon which the old covenant was established, and the old covenant was the centrality and universality of God's economy in the Old Testament. God's not delighting in and not requiring sacrifice and offering points to the termination of His economy in the Old Testament. This is the importance and the greatness of this prophecy.</note>
        <note num="3">Lit., bored my ears. This was quoted by the apostle Paul in [link]Heb. 10:5[/link] as "a body You have prepared for Me." The boring of the slave's ears indicates that the master required the slave's obedience ([link]Exo. 21:6[/link]). It signifies that God required obedience of Christ, who in His humanity was God's slave ([link]Phil. 2:7[/link]). This obedience, spoken of by Paul in [link]Phil. 2:8[/link], was for Him to do the will of God by being the sacrifice and the offering in His crucifixion in the flesh, the body ([link]Col. 1:22[/link]; [link]Heb. 10:7-10[/link]). Based on this, Paul interpreted the boring of the ears as the preparing of a body, in which Christ offered Himself to God as the sacrifice and the offering to replace the sacrifice and the offering of animals in the Old Testament.</note>

        <note num="1">The psalms in Book One were written mainly by David. Eight psalms in Book Two ([link]Psa. 42-49[/link]), as well as [link]Psa. 84[/link], [link book="Psa."]85[/link], [link book="Psa."]87[/link], and [link book="Psa."]88[/link] in Book Three, were composed by the sons of Korah, who was the leader of a rebellion against Moses and God ([link]Num. 16:1-3[/link]). About 470 years after Korah's rebellion, Samuel the prophet, Heman the singer, and some other psalmists came forth as Korah the rebel's descendants at the time of David ([link]1 Chron. 6:31-37[/link]). The descendants of Korah continued to serve during the time of the captivity. Even the descendants of a leading rebel could become the godly writers of psalms, praising God in their holy writings as a record that has existed for generations. What a grace this was!</note>
        <note num="2">In this psalm the psalmist was panting and thirsting ([link]v. 2[/link]) for God at a time when he and his people had been stripped and defeated by the neighboring nations and were in captivity (see note [link]6[sup]1[/sup][/link]). Panting and thirsting for God are different from worshipping God in a formal, religious way. God is our living water for us to drink ([link]John 4:10[/link], [link]14[/link]; [link]7:37-39a[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 12:13[/link]). We need to pant and thirst for Him and to drink Him.</note>
        <note num="3">[link]Psalm 1[/link], the opening word of Book One, begins with the law, but Book Two begins with God. Surely there is no comparison between God and the law. This shows us that Book Two of the Psalms is higher than Book One. Among the five books of the Psalms, the revelation is progressive. The Psalms are like a stairway of five steps that takes us higher in its revelation in a progressive way.[br][br]In Book One the psalmists were turned from the law to Christ, and Christ brought them to the enjoyment of God in His house and in His city. Book Two begins with the direct enjoyment of God and unveils the psalmists' intensified enjoyment of God in His house, and even more in His city, through the suffering, exalted, and reigning Christ. Such a Christ is the way for sinners to enter into God ([link]John 14:6[/link], [link]20[/link]). God's house is both Christ as God's tabernacle and God's temple ([link]John 1:14[/link]; [link]2:19-21[/link]) and the church as the enlargement of Christ, the enlarged temple ([link]1 Cor. 3:16[/link]; [link]Eph. 2:21[/link]). Jerusalem, the city of God that surrounded the temple, signifies God's kingdom. Both Christ and the church are the temple of God and the kingdom of God ([link]Luke 17:21[/link] and note 1; [link]Matt. 16:18-19[/link] and note [link]19[sup]2[/sup][/link]; [link]Rom. 14:17[/link] and note 1). The New Jerusalem will be the consummation of God's temple and God's kingdom ([link]Rev. 21:22[/link] and note 1; [link]22:1[/link], [link]3[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">On the one hand, the psalmist was panting after God ([link]v. 1[/link]). On the other hand, he was recalling the glorious and pleasant past in his leading of the festal multitude to enjoy God in His house with His people. Actually, this recalling was a departure from his panting after God. He should have remained in the state of panting after God. We should not allow our considerations and our remembering of our past to distract us from our present enjoyment of God (cf. [link]Phil. 3:13-14[/link] and note [link]13[sup]2[/sup][/link]).</note>

When the light shines on us, we receive the truth, the reality, and when we go to God in fellowship, we are in the light. According to this verse the divine light and the divine truth lead God's captive saints to God's holy mountain and His tabernacles, which typify the local churches. Both light and truth are in the church ([link]1 Tim. 3:15[/link]).</note>

Then they could enter into the temple to meet God their exceeding joy.

In this praise there are two balanced pairs: Christ's fairness and His victory, and Christ's kingdom and His virtues. Christ's fairness is balanced by His victory with its requirements (cf.

While Christ was on earth, He showed His splendor only once, when He was transfigured on the mountain ([link]Matt. 17:1-2[/link]). After His resurrection and ascension, He showed Himself in His splendor and majesty to Paul ([link]Acts 26:13-15[/link]) and to John ([link]Rev. 1:9-20[/link]).

        <text>[note]1[/note]The [note]2[/note]daughters of kings are among Your most prized; / The [note]3[/note]queen stands at Your right hand in the [note]4[/note]gold of Ophir.</text>
        <note num="1">[link]Verses 9-15[/link] praise Christ the King in praising the queen with the daughters of kings and with the virgins ([link]v. 14[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">The daughters of kings signify the believers of Christ in their royalty, and the king's most prized (or, honorable, glorious) women signify the believers of Christ in their honor and majesty. As those born of the King, we, the believers, have a royal and honorable status. Our conducting ourselves according to that status is a glory to Christ ([link]Eph. 4:1[/link]; [link]2 Thes. 1:11-12[/link]).</note>
        <note num="3">Signifying the church, especially the overcomers, as the unique wife of Christ. In [link]Rev. 19:7[/link] and [link]9a[/link], the wife of the Lamb is a corporate bride composed of the overcoming believers invited to the marriage dinner of the Lamb (see notes [link book="Rev." chapter="19"]7[sup]2[/sup][/link] and [link]9[sup]1[/sup][/link] there). Likewise, in this psalm the queen does not signify an individual; rather, she signifies a corporate entity composed of all her companions: the daughters of kings as the honorable women and the virgins as her friends ([link]v. 14[/link]). Thus, in this psalm Solomon the king with his many wives and concubines, who were princesses, daughters of Gentile kings ([link]1 Kings 11:1[/link], [link]3[/link]), are used in a positive sense to typify Christ as the King with His corporate wife, the church ([link]John 3:29[/link]; [link]Eph. 5:24-25[/link], [link]31-32[/link]), composed of His believers from every tribe, tongue, people, and nation ([link]Rev. 5:9[/link]).[br][br]In [link]v. 8[/link] the church is typified by the ivory palaces, the building, and in this verse the church is pictured as the queen, the wife. In the entire Scriptures these two figures &amp;#8212; the building and the bride &amp;#8212; are used to signify the church (cf. [link]Gen. 2:22[/link] and notes). On the one hand, the church is the building, the house, of God ([link]1 Tim. 3:15[/link]), and on the other hand it is the bride, the wife, of Christ ([link]2 Cor. 11:2[/link]).</note>
        <note num="4">The queen's being covered with gold signifies the church's appearing in the divine nature. The "gold" that covers the church is Christ, the divine One, as the believers' righteousness for their justification ([link]Luke 15:22[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 1:30[/link]). This is the first layer of the church's covering.</note>
        </verse>
        <verse num="10">
        <text>Hear, O [note]1[/note]daughter, and see; and incline your ear; / And [xref]a[/xref]forget your people and your father's house;</text>
        <note num="1">The daughter is the queen, who signifies the church; her people and her father's house signify the natural relationships of the church. This word corresponds to the Lord's word regarding denying the natural relationships in [link]Matt. 10:37[/link] and [link]Luke 14:26[/link].</note>

        <verse num="11">
        <text>Thus the King will desire your [note]1[/note]beauty. / Because He is your [note]2[/note]Lord, / Worship Him.</text>
        <note num="1">The queen's beauty signifies the virtues of Christ expressed through the church. This psalm praises Christ not only concerning the things that are of Him directly but also concerning the things that are of Him indirectly as manifested through His church and His overcomers. Our speaking well of the church and the believers is also a praise to Christ.</note>
        <note num="2">In [link]v. 1[/link] Christ is the King, in [link]v. 2[/link] He is a man, in [link]v. 6[/link] He is God, and in this verse He is the Lord. As the Lord of the church, Christ is worthy not only of the church's love but also of her worship.</note>

        <verse num="12">
        <text>And the [note]1[/note]daughter of Tyre [i]will come[/i] with a gift; / The [note]1[/note]rich among the people will entreat your favor.</text>
        <note num="1">The daughter of Tyre signifies the people of the flourishing world. The rich among the people signify the high class, who have great wealth but do not have God's favor (cf. [link]1 Cor. 1:26-28[/link]). The favor they entreat of the queen signifies the grace of God enjoyed by the church. As indicated by this verse, the rich will come to the church to obtain the grace of God.</note>

        <verse num="13">
        <text>The king's [note]1[/note]daughter is all glorious within [i]the royal abode;[/i] / Her [xref]a[/xref]garment is a [note]2[/note]woven work inwrought with gold.</text>
        <note num="1">The king's daughter is the queen, signifying the church, and her being all glorious within the royal abode signifies the glorious church ([link]Eph. 5:27[/link]), which takes Christ as her royal abode. First we, the believers of Christ, take Christ as our abode, and then we become His abode ([link]John 15:4[/link]; [link]14:3[/link], [link]20[/link], [link]23[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">Signifying the Christ who has been dealt with through many sufferings and through death and resurrection to become the righteousness of the church to meet the righteous requirement of God that the church may be justified before God ([link]1 Cor. 1:30[/link]). Thus, the woven work inwrought with gold refers again to the first layer of covering &amp;#8212; Christ as our righteousness, through whom we are justified &amp;#8212; signified by the gold of Ophir in [link]v. 9[/link] (see note [link]9[sup]4[/sup][/link]). Cf. note [link]39[sup]1[/sup] in Exo. 28[/link].</note>

        <note num="1">Another garment, the second layer of her covering, signifying that the church will be led to Christ the King clothed with the righteousnesses of the saints to meet the requirement of Christ for their marriage ([link]Rev. 19:8[/link] and note 2; [link]Matt. 22:11-12[/link] and note [link]11[sup]1[/sup][/link]). The queen in this psalm has two garments. The first garment, "the gold of Ophir" ([link]v. 9[/link]), the woven work inwrought with gold ([link]v. 13[/link]), corresponds to Christ as our objective righteousness, which is for our justification. The second garment, the embroidered clothing, corresponds to Christ "embroidered" into us by the transforming work of the Spirit and lived out of us as our subjective righteousnesses, which are for our victory. The first garment is put upon us that we may stand in the presence of God ([link]Luke 15:22[/link]), whereas the second garment is woven into our character, embroidered into our being, that we may stand before the King.</note>

        <note num="1">Signifying that the overcoming saints will enter the New Jerusalem, Christ's palace ([link]Rev. 3:12[/link]), with rejoicing and exultation. This psalm mentions first the abode ([link]v. 13[/link]) and then the palace. When Christ becomes our abode, we become His abode &amp;#8212; a mutual abode ([link]John 15:4[/link]). Because Christ is the King and we are the queen, eventually this mutual abode becomes the palace, signified by the New Jerusalem, which is actually the Triune God wrought into the believers and mingled with them to be one entity, the mutual dwelling of God and His redeemed for eternity ([link]Rev. 21:3[/link], [link]22[/link] and note [link]22[sup]2[/sup][/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">Verses [link]16[/link] and [link]17[/link] praise Christ the King in praising His sons.

        <note num="2">The king in [link]Psa. 45[/link] typifies Christ as the King; the city in this psalm, and often in the Bible as a whole, signifies a kingdom. As the King, Christ needs a city in which to rule and reign. The city of God is the enlarged, strengthened, and built-up church as the ruling center for God's reign in His kingdom. The church as the house of God ([link]23:6[/link]; [link]26:8[/link]; [link]27:4[/link]; [link]36:8[/link]; [link]1 Tim. 3:15[/link]) must be enlarged to become the church as the city, the kingdom, of God ([link]Rev. 5:9-10[/link]). Eventually, in God's economy the house of God becomes the holy city, New Jerusalem, as God's eternal habitation and the ruling center of His eternal kingdom ([link]Rev. 21:2-3[/link], [link]22[/link]; [link]22:3[/link]).</note>

This enjoyment of God is through Christ, in Christ, and with Christ, and it is experienced in the universal church as the Body of Christ and in the local churches as the expressions of the Body.[br][br]The Psalms indicate that we first need to experience Christ. Then Christ will lead us to the local church to enjoy God ([link]23:6[/link]). When the church as the house of God is enlarged and strengthened, it becomes the city &amp;#8212; the kingdom for God's ruling and reigning ([link]Matt. 16:18-19[/link]). In the church as the house we enjoy God in the aspect of His dwelling. In the church as the city we enjoy God in the aspect of His ruling and reigning.</note>

The first category ([link]Psa. 49[/link]) consists of those who trust in their wealth (i.e., in anything other than Christ). In the second category ([link]Psa. 50[/link]) are those who call upon the Lord according to His covenant. The third category ([link]Psa. 51[/link]) is a single person, King David, who repented, confessed his sins to God, and asked God for His purging. Those in the first category have no share in the enjoyment of God in Christ; those in the second category participate in the enjoyment of God; and the one in the third category has a full portion of the enjoyment of God in Christ.</note>

        <note num="1">This psalm tells us that some of the saints of God were offering burnt offerings and other kinds of offerings ([link]vv. 8-13[/link]), but because they were lacking in affection, they would not offer the sacrifice of thanksgiving to God. Thus, the psalmist, speaking for God, indicated that what God wants is not the burnt offering but the thanksgiving offering. We can offer certain offerings without being touched in our hearts, but when we are thankful to God and offer to Him a prayer of thanksgiving, our hearts are deeply touched and we are filled with affection and tender feeling toward God. This is the kind of offering God desires.</note>

The Spirit of holiness in the Old Testament is for God to make His people holy by separating them unto Himself. The Holy Spirit at the initiation of the New Testament age was for God's incarnation, in which God in His divine nature was imparted into humanity and mingled with the human nature (without forming a third nature) to produce a God-man who was intrinsically holy ([link]Matt. 1:18[/link]; [link]Luke 1:35[/link]).

        <note num="1">[link]Psalms 52-67[/link] may be considered the pious expressions of the psalmists uttered out of their complex sentiments while enjoying God in His house. On the one hand, the psalmists enjoyed God and His salvation, and on the other hand, they condemned their enemies and asked God to judge and destroy them. In these psalms the sentiments of the psalmists were strong, mixed, and complex.[br][br]The psalms in this section concern humanity in the ethical realm. They speak of being just and upright and holding on to one's integrity. However, these things are not the spirituality revealed in the New Testament. The divine revelation in the Bible is progressive. To properly appreciate the Psalms requires the revelation of God's economy in the New Testament. God's eternal economy is to impart Himself into man and dispense His riches into man's inner being ([link]Eph. 3:8-9[/link], [link]14-19[/link]) that He may be man's life and life supply. By His life and the bountiful supply of His life-giving Spirit ([link]Phil. 1:19b[/link]), man can live Him and magnify Him ([link]Phil. 1:20-21a[/link]) for His manifestation ([link]1 Tim. 3:16a[/link]). In this way, all His chosen people can corporately be His expression as His fullness, His organism, the church ([link]Eph. 1:22-23[/link]; [link]3:19-21[/link]). In comparison with the spiritual standard revealed in the New Testament, the spiritual level in these psalms is much inferior. Cf. note [link]1[sup]1[/sup], par. 2, in Job 6[/link].</note>

        <note num="1">In this psalm, instead of asking God to have mercy on his enemies in His faithfulness, David asked God to annihilate his enemies ([link]v. 5[/link]), while he himself was seeking to participate in the enjoyment of God in His help, sustenance, and salvation ([link]vv. 1-4[/link]). A spiritual person would not pray in such a way. In typifying Christ as the fighting Victor (cf. note [link]3[sup]1[/sup] in 1 Chron. 22[/link]), David was justified in asking God to annihilate his enemies; but in his spiritual living, it was not right for David to hate his enemies and to ask God to destroy them. This is against the nature of the spiritual life of God's chosen people, and even against God's holy word in the Old Testament in [link]Prov. 25:21-22[/link], quoted by the apostle Paul in [link]Rom. 12:20[/link].

        <note num="1">In this psalm David trusted in God and enjoyed God in His salvation, lovingkindness, and faithfulness ([link]vv. 1-5[/link], [link]7-11[/link]). At the same time, he rejoiced at the misfortune of his enemies ([link]v. 6b[/link]). See note [link]1[sup]1[/sup] in Psa. 54[/link].[br][br]While we are trusting in God and enjoying His care according to His lovingkindness and faithfulness, we need to learn the lessons of God's discipline. We need to find out the reason for the oppositions against us in our environment, for they are God's discipline to correct us, to break us, and to bring us down for our eventual transformation in life ([link]Heb. 12:5-11[/link] and notes [link]7[sup]1[/sup][/link] and [link]10[sup]1[/sup][/link]; [link]1 Pet. 4:12-19[/link] and note [link]17[sup]1[/sup][/link]). We should not pray that God would put others down; we are the ones who need to be brought down and broken by God. We should not have the shortage, displayed in many of the psalms, of being devoid of learning the lessons of God's discipline. Cf. note [link]13[sup]1[/sup] in Job 2[/link].</note>

        <note num="1">A quotation of Moses' prayer in [link]Num. 10:35[/link], uttered when the Ark of the Covenant set out from Mount Sinai. [link]Psalm 68[/link] is the highest peak of the divine revelation concerning Christ in all the Psalms. It is written in poetry, with types and signs, portraying the steps in God's move on the earth in Christ. The Ark (typifying Christ &amp;#8212; [link]Exo. 25:10-22[/link] and notes) was the center of the tabernacle (also typifying Christ &amp;#8212; [link]John 1:14[/link]). God's move in the tabernacle with the Ark among Israel, His elect, from Sinai to Zion typifies the Triune God's move in Christ as His all-inclusive embodiment from Christ's incarnation to His ascension. In the type, God's move was from Sinai ([link]vv. 8b[/link], [link]17b[/link]), beginning with the decreeing of the law and the erecting of the tabernacle, which signifies the incarnated Christ, through the wilderness ([link]vv. 4b[/link], [link]7b[/link]), which signifies the earth, to Mount Zion ([link]v. 16[/link]), God's dwelling place, which signifies God's dwelling place in the heavens ([link]Rev. 14:1[/link]). In the reality, God's move in Christ and through Christ for the accomplishing of His New Testament economy began with Christ's incarnation, which was the setting up of the real and living tabernacle in whom God dwelt and through whom He could move on earth; continued through Christ's human living on the earth with His crucifixion and resurrection; and concluded with Christ's ascension to Zion in the heavens. This unique move of God is portrayed in [link]vv. 1-18[/link] of this psalm. See note [link]8[sup]1[/sup] in Eph. 4[/link].</note>
        <note num="2">The enemies here typify Satan and his forces of evil in the heavenlies ([link]Eph. 6:12[/link]). This prayer is actually the aspiration of all God's elect. Cf. note [link]12[sup]1[/sup][/link].</note>

        <note num="1">In the praise rendered to God by His elect in [link]vv. 24-28[/link], a scenery in typology is portrayed concerning God's New Testament economy in the accomplishing of God's redemption by Christ for God's salvation and in the spreading of the glad tidings of Christ's accomplishment with the goodly words of the gospel. Benjamin, mentioned here, had two names, the first of which was Ben-oni. This name, given to him by his mother Rachel as she was dying in childbirth, means [i]son of my affliction[/i] ([link]Gen. 35:18a[/link]). As the son of affliction, Benjamin typifies Christ, who, as the man of sorrows ([link]Isa. 53:3[/link]) in His incarnation and human life on earth, accomplished God's eternal redemption for His full salvation ([link]Heb. 9:12[/link]). Whereas Rachel named her son Ben-oni, Jacob immediately changed the child's name to Benjamin, which means [i]son of the right hand[/i] ([link]Gen. 35:18b[/link]). To be at the right hand is to be in a position of glory and honor. As the son of the right hand, Benjamin typifies Christ, who, as the Son of the right hand in His resurrection, victory, and ascension, ministers in the heavens to carry out the application of God's redemption for His salvation ([link]Heb. 8:1-2[/link]; [link]7:25[/link]). Christ was incarnated to be Ben-oni, the man of sorrows, but in resurrection He became Benjamin, the Son of the right hand in glory and honor ([link]80:17[/link]; [link]Mark 16:19[/link]; [link]Acts 2:33[/link]; [link]5:31[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">Judah is the lion with the power and the scepter, and he is the peace (Shiloh) to God's people ([link]Rev. 5:5a[/link]; [link]Gen. 49:8-10[/link]). Whereas Benjamin typifies Christ mainly in His humanity, Judah typifies Christ mainly in His divinity. In His divinity Christ is not a man of sorrows but a lion with power and authority (signified by the scepter). In particular, Judah typifies Christ as the victory for God's people and the peace to God's people. In the application of redemption, Christ is our peace ([link]Eph. 2:14-15[/link]).[br][br]Judah, the kingly tribe, was accompanied always by Benjamin, a warrior tribe ([link]Gen. 49:27[/link]), for God's kingdom on the earth. In typology Judah and Benjamin, who were joined geographically, form a group for the accomplishment and application of Christ's redemption for God's salvation. With Benjamin the emphasis is on the accomplishment of redemption; with Judah the emphasis is on the application (in Christ's ascension) of redemption.</note>
        <note num="3">Dwelling at the shore of the sea (Galilee) and being a shore for ships ([link]Gen. 49:13[/link]), Zebulun typifies Christ as the "shore" of the evangelists for the transportation and spreading in the preaching of God's gospel. After Christ accomplished all the things that are to be proclaimed as the gospel, on the day of Pentecost at least 120 gospel "ships," all of whom were Galileans ([link]Acts 2:7[/link]; [link]13:31[/link]), set out from the "shore" to spread the gospel. See note [link]13[sup]1[/sup] in Gen. 49[/link].</note>
        <note num="4">According to [link]Gen. 49:21[/link] (see note there), Naphtali is a hind let loose, and he gives beautiful words. Naphtali typifies Christ as the One who is released from death in resurrection, signified by the hind let loose ([link]Psa. 22[/link], title; [link]S.S. 2:8-9[/link]), and gives beautiful words for the preaching of His gospel ([link]Matt. 28:18-20[/link]).[br][br]In typology Zebulun and Naphtali form a group for the spreading and the propagating of the glad tidings of Christ's redemption, accomplished for God's salvation. The people of both Zebulun and Naphtali were men of Galilee ([link]Matt. 4:12-17[/link]; [link]Acts 1:11[/link]), from whom the gospel of Christ has been spread, preached, and propagated.</note>

After His life of suffering on earth, typified by the sufferings of David, Christ ascended to the heavens, where He is now reigning as the King, typified by Solomon.</note>

However, the real vanity is anything besides God. Idols are vanity; material prosperity is vanity; anything other than God is vanity ([link]Eccl. 1:2[/link]). A pure heart is one that is set on nothing but God.

        <note num="1">The solution to the psalmist's perplexity concerning the prosperity of the wicked was obtained in God's sanctuary. First, God's sanctuary, His habitation, is in our spirit ([link]Eph. 2:22[/link]) and, second, it is the church ([link]1 Tim. 3:15[/link]). Thus, to go into the sanctuary of God, we need to turn to our spirit and go to the meetings of the church. Once we are in the sanctuary &amp;#8212; in the spirit and in the church &amp;#8212; we will have another view, a particular perception, of the situation concerning the wicked ([link]vv. 18-20[/link]). In our spirit and in the church we receive divine revelation and obtain the explanation to all our problems.</note>

        <note num="1">This verse reveals that God's pure seeker would have God as his only possession in heaven and his unique desire on earth. God was the psalmist's unique goal. The psalmist did not care for anything except God and gaining Him. In this matter Paul was the same ([link]Phil. 3:8[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">In God's sanctuary the psalmist was instructed to take only God Himself as his portion, not anything other than God. The one who does not care for God may gain many things and seem to prosper. However, the one who cares for God will be restricted by God and even stripped by God of many things, as was the case with Job ([link]Job 1:6-2:10[/link]) and the apostle Paul ([link]Phil. 3:7-8[/link]). God's intention with His seekers is that they may find everything in Him and not be distracted from the absolute enjoyment of Himself. It is not a matter of keeping the law, as in [link]Psa. 1[/link], or of being right or wrong, but of gaining God and keeping God as everything. See note [link]13[sup]1[/sup] in Job 2[/link].</note>

        <note num="1">This psalm concerns the desolation of the house of God. After reaching the highest enjoyment of God in His house and His city at the end of Book Two, the psalmist lost this enjoyment, and God's house was desolated, as described in this psalm. [link]Verses 1-11[/link] are the psalmist's painful presentation of the perpetual ruins and damage in the sanctuary of God ([link]v. 3[/link]). The temple, God's house, was desolated to such an extent that it was burned ([link]vv. 7-8[/link]), and the city surrounding it was ruined ([link]2 Chron. 36:19[/link]). The intrinsic reason for the desolation was that Christ was not exalted by God's people; they did not give Him the preeminence, the first place, in everything ([link]Jer. 2:13[/link]; cf. [link]Col. 1:18[/link]; [link]Rev. 2:4[/link] and note 2). The problem of desolation is solved by Christ being properly appreciated and exalted by God's people (see note [link]17[sup]1[/sup] in Psa. 80[/link]). The enjoyment of God in the house and the city of God can be maintained and preserved only when Christ is properly appreciated and exalted by God's people.</note>

Christ, the second of the Divine Trinity, is the One who will execute judgment upon all sinners ([link]Acts 10:42[/link]). Here the judgment is upon the desolators, who had gone too far in executing God's judgment on His people (see note [link]13[sup]1[/sup], par. 1, in Isa. 26[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">The fact that exaltation comes neither from the east nor from the west nor from the south indicates that it comes from the north, i.e., from God, who dwells in the north (cf. [link]Isa. 14:13-14[/link]; [link]Ezek. 1:4[/link]; [link]Psa. 48:2[/link]). Furthermore, this indicates that Christ as the Judge (see note [link]1[sup]1[/sup][/link]) is unique. Exaltation should not come from any direction other than where He dwells. Therefore, preeminence should be given to Him ([link]Col. 1:18[/link]).</note>

The fact that these psalms speak of the desolation of the temple, the city of Jerusalem, and the people indicates that they were written after the children of Israel had been taken captive to Babylon.</note>

God has given the first place, the highest position, the preeminence, in the entire universe to Christ. This is the exaltation of Christ ([link]Phil. 2:9-11[/link]). The way to be restored from desolation is to exalt Christ. Whenever God's people do not give Christ the preeminence, the house of God, signifying the church, becomes desolate. Whenever God's people exalt Christ, giving Him the preeminence in every aspect of their living, there is restoration ([link]v. 19[/link]) and revival ([link]v. 18[/link]).

        <note num="1">This psalm, concerning the psalmist's love for the house of God with Christ, follows the psalms on the stripping of God's seekers and the desolation of God's house, beginning with [link]Psa. 73[/link]. In the recovery and restoration ([link]Psa. 80[/link]) the loveliness and sweetness of God's house is intensified.[br][br]The intrinsic content of [link]Psa. 84[/link] is the secret revelation concerning the enjoyment of Christ as the incarnated Triune God, the God-man. The center of this secret revelation is the house of God ([link]vv. 4[/link], [link]10[/link]), typified by the tabernacle ([link]Exo. 40:2-8[/link]) and the temple ([link]1 Kings 6:1-3[/link]; [link]8:3-11[/link]). Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God ([link]Col. 2:9[/link]) is the fulfillment of the types of the tabernacle and the temple. This fulfillment commenced in His incarnation as the individual Christ ([link]John 1:14[/link]; [link]2:21[/link]) and will continue until it consummates in the New Jerusalem as the corporate Christ, the great God-man ([link]Rev. 21:2-3[/link], [link]22[/link]). The New Testament, from Matthew through Revelation, covers the entire span of the incarnation of the Triune God and is a record of the divine incarnation. The enjoyment of Christ as the incarnated Triune God in God's house is portrayed by the arrangement of the tabernacle and its furnishings (see note [link]3[sup]1[/sup][/link] in this chapter and notes [link book="Heb." chapter="9"]4[sup]1[/sup][/link] and [link]4[sup]3[/sup] in Heb. 9[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">The bronze altar for the sacrifices and the golden altar of incense. The two altars signify the leading consummations of the work of the incarnated Triune God, who is Christ as the embodiment of God for His increase. The mentioning of these two altars together in [link]Exo. 40:5-6[/link] indicates that they are closely related in our spiritual experience. At the bronze altar, a type of the cross of Christ, our problems before God are solved through the crucified Christ as the sacrifices. This qualifies us to enter into the tabernacle, a type of Christ as the incarnated and enterable Triune God, and to contact God at the incense altar. At the golden altar of incense in front of the Holy of Holies (see note [link]4[sup]1[/sup] in Heb. 9[/link]), the resurrected Christ in His ascension is the incense for us to be accepted by God in peace. Through our prayer at the incense altar we enter into the Holy of Holies &amp;#8212; our spirit ([link]Heb. 10:19[/link]) &amp;#8212; where we experience Christ as the Ark of the Testimony with its contents. Through such an experience of Christ we are incorporated into the tabernacle, the incarnated Triune God, to become a part of the corporate Christ ([link]1 Cor. 12:12[/link]) as God's testimony for His manifestation. See notes [link]33[sup]1[/sup] in Exo. 16[/link] and [link]33[sup]1[/sup], par. 2, in Jer. 31[/link].</note>
        <note num="2">Signifying the believers, who are small and frail.</note>
        <note num="3">A home is a place of rest, and a nest is a place of refuge. Through the two altars God's redeemed can find a nest as their refuge and a home with God in rest. The cross of Christ, typified by the bronze altar, is our "nest," our refuge, where we are saved from our troubles and where we "lay" our young, i.e., produce new believers through the preaching of the gospel. When we experience the resurrected Christ in His ascension, typified by the golden altar of incense, we are accepted by God in such a Christ and find a home, a place of rest, in the house of God. This house is the processed and consummated Triune God united, mingled, and incorporated with all His redeemed, regenerated, and transformed elect ([link]John 14:1-23[/link]) to be the Body of Christ in the present age and the New Jerusalem as the mutual dwelling place of God and His redeemed in eternity ([link]Rev. 21:3[/link], [link]22[/link]).</note>

On the one hand, we have entered into God; on the other hand, we are still on the highways to enter into God. That the highways are in our heart means that we need to take the way of the church internally, not merely externally.</note>

        <note num="1">Meaning weeping. On the one hand, those on the highways to Zion are strengthened in God ([link]v. 5[/link]); on the other hand, they are opposed by Satan, who causes them to suffer persecution. The trouble and persecution caused by Satan can make the highway a valley of weeping. This special term indicates that the psalmist had been disciplined by God and had been stripped by Him (see notes [link]26[sup]1[/sup] in Psa. 73[/link] and [link]1[sup]1[/sup] in Job 3[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">When we pass through the valley of Baca, God makes this valley a spring (cf. [link]Col. 1:24[/link]; [link]Heb. 10:34[/link]). This spring is the Spirit ([link]John 4:14[/link]; [link]7:38-39[/link]). The more we weep on the highways to Zion, the more we receive the Spirit. While we are weeping, we are being filled with the Spirit, and the Spirit becomes our spring.</note>
        <note num="3">Those who come into the church life by passing through the valley of weeping find that this weeping eventually becomes a great blessing to them. This blessing is the Spirit ([link]Gal. 3:14[/link]). The tears they shed are their own, but these tears issue in a spring, which becomes the early rain, the Spirit as the blessing.</note>

        <note num="1">[link]Psalm 89[/link], especially [link]vv. 3-4[/link], [link]19-29[/link], and [link]34-37[/link], unveils the intention of God that Christ, His Anointed, would possess the entire earth. In [link]vv. 19-20[/link] Christ, the unique One in God's record ([link]87:6[/link]), has become God's Holy One, God's mighty One, God's anointed One ([link]Acts 2:27[/link]; [link]Isa. 9:6[/link]; [link]Matt. 1:16[/link]). He calls God His Father and His God ([link]v. 26[/link]; [link]John 20:17[/link]). He has become the Firstborn and "the highest of the kings of the earth" ([link]v. 27[/link]; [link]Rom. 8:29[/link]; [link]Rev. 1:5a[/link]). His throne will be like the sun before God; it will be established forever like the moon ([link]vv. 36-37[/link]; [link]72:5[/link]). God will establish His seed forever and "His throne as the days of heaven" ([link]v. 29[/link]). God will extend the territory of this unique One so that He will possess the entire earth, setting "His hand on the sea and His right hand on the rivers" ([link]v. 25[/link]; cf. [link]Rev. 10:1-2[/link]). The sea probably refers to the Mediterranean Sea, the center of the populated earth.

        <note num="1">[link]Psalms 90-92[/link] concern the saints' deeper experience of God in their being identified with Christ. [link]Psalm 36:8[/link] speaks of drinking the river of God's pleasures and eating the fatness of God's house, indicating that we can experience the Lord by eating and drinking Him (cf. [link]John 6:48-58[/link], [link]63[/link]; [link]7:37[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 10:3-4[/link]; [link]12:13[/link]). According to Moses, the giver of the law and the writer of this psalm, we can also dwell in the eternal Triune God as our Lord ([link]v. 1[/link]; [link]91:9[/link]; [link]Deut. 33:27[/link]; cf. [link]John 15:4[/link]; [link]1 John 4:15-16[/link]; [link]Rev. 21:22[/link]). To dwell in God is to have our living in God ([link]Col. 2:6[/link]; [link]3:3[/link]; [link]1 John 4:16[/link]), taking Him as our everything. This is deeper than eating and drinking Him. To take God as our habitation, our eternal dwelling place, is the highest and fullest experience of God.[br][br]Book Four of the Psalms unveils the saints' deeper experience of God in the identification with Christ, and God's recovery of His title and right over the earth. This indicates that our experience of dwelling in God paves the way for Christ to come to possess the earth that God may recover His title (ownership) and right over the earth (see note [link]1[sup]1[/sup] in Psa. 93[/link]). Without the saints' deeper experience of God, God has no way to recover this title and right.</note>

        <note num="1">[i]You[/i] and [i]Your[/i] in [link]vv. 9-13[/link] refer to Christ, as proven by the fact that [link]vv. 11-12[/link] of this psalm are quoted by Satan in [link]Matt. 4:6[/link] in reference to Christ. This indicates that in this psalm it is Christ who takes God as His habitation, His dwelling place. Thus, not only Moses took God as his dwelling place ([link]90:1[/link]), but even the Lord Jesus, while He was on earth, took God the Father as His habitation. Moses, the lawgiver, and Christ, the grace-giver, were the same in taking God as their dwelling place, as their habitation. Thus, the saints (represented by Moses) and Christ are identified as one.[br][br]To be identified with Christ is to be identified with Him not only in His death, in His resurrection, and in His ascension but also in His taking God as His habitation. If we would be identified with Christ in His death, resurrection, and ascension, we need to abide in Christ ([link]John 15:4[/link]), and to abide in Christ is not only to remain in Him but also to dwell in Him, taking Him as our everything.</note>

This psalm has three sections: [link]vv. 1-11[/link], concerning suffering and affliction; [link]vv. 12-22[/link], concerning the rebuilding of Zion, the restoration of the destroyed temple and the holy city; and [link]vv. 23-28[/link], unveiling the Lord as the One who is everlasting in His resurrection. That this psalm concerns Christ is indicated by the fact that [link]vv. 25-27[/link] are quoted in [link]Heb. 1:10-12[/link].</note>

        <note num="1">The affliction of the psalmist refers to the affliction of Christ ([link]vv. 6-8[/link]). This verse is a particular verse concerning Christ's suffering, which was related to His zeal for God's house ([link]John 2:17[/link]; [link]Psa. 69:9[/link]). Here Christ is likened to a lone sparrow on a housetop, referring to the flat roof of a Jewish house, where people would often go to pray ([link]Acts 10:9[/link]). This indicates that when the Lord Jesus was on earth, probably there were times when in the night He, like a lone bird on a housetop, would watch and pray ([link]Matt. 14:23[/link]; [link]Luke 6:12[/link]), caring not for His own interest but for the interest of God and of God's house.[br][br]In typology, [link]Psa. 102[/link] first refers to Christ's suffering, especially to His death. Christ's suffering consummated in His death, and through His death the church, God's house, came into existence. Eventually, the church as God's house becomes God's city, God's kingdom ([link]Matt. 16:18-19[/link]; [link]Rom. 14:17[/link]; [link]Eph. 2:19[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">This psalm unveils Christ's death and His existence in His resurrection ([link]vv. 23-28[/link] and note [link]25[sup]1[/sup][/link]). The product of Christ's death and resurrection is the church, typified by Zion with God's house and God's city ([link]Gal. 4:26[/link]; [link]Heb. 12:22-23[/link]). Zion is the center of the city of Jerusalem ([link]vv. 16[/link], [link]21[/link]), and in this psalm it typifies the church as the center of God's kingdom ([link]Matt. 16:18-19[/link] and note [link]19[sup]2[/sup][/link]).

We should take pleasure in all the members of the church and should favor the ground of the church, which is the ground of oneness ([link]Deut. 12:5-28[/link]; [link]14:23-25[/link]; [link]John 17:11[/link], [link]21-23[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 1:10-13a[/link]; [link]Eph. 4:3-6[/link]; [link]Rev. 1:11[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">Here the rebuilding of Zion typifies the rebuilding of the church. The history of Israel is a portrait of the history of the church ([link]1 Cor. 9:24-10:11[/link]). After existing on the earth for a time, Israel passed through a period of destruction and devastation, and the people of Israel were carried away to captivity in Babylon ([link]2 Kings 24-25[/link]). Likewise, the church was produced through Christ's death and in Christ's resurrection, and then it existed on earth for a time before it became degraded (see notes [link]1[sup]1[/sup] in 2 Tim. 1[/link], [link]3[sup]1[/sup] in 2 Pet. 1[/link], and [link]4[sup]2[/sup] in Rev. 2[/link]) and was eventually devastated. The book of Revelation shows that Babylon the Great is versus the church ([link]Rev. 17:1-6[/link]). Eventually, Babylon the Great will fall ([link]Rev. 17:16[/link]; [link]18:2[/link]) and the church will be fully established ([link]Rev. 21:2-22:5[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">[link]Psalm 109[/link] is a prayer of David concerning his sufferings and is also a description of his sufferings. David here is a type of Christ, and David's sufferings typify Christ's sufferings in His flesh ([link]Heb. 5:7-8[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 4:1[/link]). This is indicated by the fact that [link]v. 8[/link] is quoted in [link]Acts 1:20[/link] and applied to Judas, who betrayed Christ.[br][br]David's prayer in this psalm typifies Christ's prayer ([link]Heb. 5:7[/link] and note). The prayer in this psalm is answered in the next, which unveils Christ in His ascension, indicating that God's answer to Christ's prayer was not only through resurrection but also in ascension.</note>

        <note num="1">[link]Psalm 110[/link] unveils Christ in His ascension. In this psalm Christ is revealed as the King ([link]v. 2[/link]), the Priest ([link]v. 4[/link]), the Warrior ([link]v. 3[/link]), and the Victor ([link]vv. 5-7[/link]).[br][br]This verse concerning Christ's ascension is quoted numerous times in the New Testament ([link]Matt. 22:44[/link]; [link]Mark 12:36[/link]; [link]Luke 20:42-43[/link]; [link]Acts 2:34-35[/link]; [link]Heb. 1:13[/link]), and Christ's sitting at the right hand of God is referred to a number of other times ([link]Mark 16:19[/link]; [link]Acts 2:33[/link]; [link]Rom. 8:34[/link]; etc.).</note>
        <note num="2">See note [link]20[sup]3[/sup] in Eph. 1[/link]. Christ's ascension to the right hand of God is not merely a matter of His being in a place but of His being in a person, the Father. In His ascension Christ entered into the Father's being and sat down there ([link]John 16:28[/link]). Cf. note [link]23[sup]1[/sup] in Isa. 22[/link].[br][br]This word concerning Christ's sitting at the right hand of God implies Christ's kingship. In His ascension Christ was made by God the Lord, the Christ, the Leader of the entire universe, and the Savior ([link]Acts 2:36[/link]; [link]5:31[/link]; [link]10:36[/link]).</note>

        <note num="2">In the eyes of the Lord our willing consecration, our offering ourselves to Him, is a matter of splendor. Although the church has become degraded, throughout the centuries there has been a line of those who have offered themselves willingly to the Lord in the splendor, the beauty, of their consecration.[br][br]The word may also be translated [i]adornment.[/i] The splendor of consecration is an adornment. If we offer ourselves willingly to the Lord, we will be beautified with a divine, heavenly splendor.</note>
        <note num="3">Here Christ likens Himself to a plant that needs the watering of the mild, soft, gentle dew. As Christ is on His way to carry out God's economy, He needs to be watered. Christ is watered by those who offer themselves willingly to Him. Whoever volunteers himself to Christ as an offering is a young man likened to the dew conceived in the womb of the dawn for watering Christ.</note>

        <note num="1">This day is the day of Christ's resurrection. On the day of His resurrection the Lord Jesus was made the cornerstone by God. Christ was chosen by God in eternity past to be the cornerstone for God's spiritual building ([link]1 Pet. 1:20[/link]; [link]2:4[/link]). Then, the Jewish leaders as the builders rejected Him to the uttermost, to such an extent that they put Him on the cross ([link]Matt. 21:38-42a[/link]). God chose Christ as the cornerstone a second time in Christ's resurrection ([link]Acts 4:10-11[/link]), thereby confirming His initial choosing of Christ in eternity past. After God resurrected Christ, He uplifted Him to the heavens ([link]Luke 24:51[/link]; [link]Acts 1:9[/link]). Christ's ascension to Zion in the heavens ([link]Rev. 14:1[/link]) was a further confirmation that God had chosen Him to be the cornerstone ([link]Isa. 28:16[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 2:6[/link]). Both Christ's resurrection and His ascension prove and confirm that He is the One whom God has chosen to be the head of the corner for God's building.[br][br]As the all-inclusive stone Christ is the centrality of God's move for the building up of His eternal habitation ([link]Matt. 21:42[/link], [link]44[/link]; [link]Zech. 3:9[/link], cf. [link]Rev. 5:5-6[/link]; [link]Acts 4:10-12[/link]; [link]Isa. 28:16[/link]; [link]Eph. 2:19-22[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 2:4-8[/link]; [link]Dan. 2:34-35[/link]; [link]Zech. 4:7[/link]; [link]Rev. 21:11[/link], cf. [link]4:3[/link]). Everything Christ is, everything He has done, and everything He is doing is due to the fact that He is the cornerstone. It is by His being the cornerstone that He could die for us, that we could be crucified with Him, made alive with Him, resurrected with Him, and seated with Him in the heavenlies, and that He could save us, transform us into precious stones, and build us together to be God's habitation, God's unique temple in the universe.</note>

[link]Psalm 119[/link] is a psalm of 176 verses describing Christ, who is the reality of the law, the commandments, the ordinances, the statutes, the precepts, and the judgments.</note>

        <note num="1">Christ is the reality of the law as the testimony of God. The testimony of God signifies Christ, the embodiment of God ([link]Col. 2:9[/link]), as the living portrait of what God is. See note [link]1[sup]1[/sup] in Exo. 20[/link].</note>
        <note num="2">There are two kinds of people in relation to the law: (1) the letter-keepers, illustrated by the Judaizers and Saul of Tarsus ([link]Phil. 3:6b[/link]), and (2) the God-seekers, illustrated by the psalmists, especially by the writer of this psalm, and by the apostle Paul ([link]2 Cor. 3:6[/link]). As a lover of God, the psalmist sought God with all his heart, loved God's name and remembered it ([link]vv. 132[/link], [link]55[/link]), sought God's favor by entreating His countenance ([link]v. 58[/link]), asked God to cause His face to shine upon him ([link]v. 135[/link]), walked in God's presence ([link]v. 168[/link]), considered God's law to be His living and loving word breathed out of His mouth ([link]vv. 13[/link], [link]72[/link], [link]88[/link]; cf. [link]2 Tim. 3:16[/link]), tasted God's word and found it sweeter than honey to his mouth ([link]v. 103[/link]), esteemed God's word as more precious than fine gold ([link]v. 127[/link]), and considered God's word a lamp to his feet and a light to his path ([link]v. 105[/link]).[br][br]In this psalm many different verbs are used to express the attitude of the God-seekers toward God's law as God's testimony and God's word: choosing it ([link]vv. 30[/link], [link]173[/link]); believing it ([link]v. 66[/link]); lifting up their hands unto it ([link]v. 48a[/link] and note); loving it ([link]vv. 47[/link], [link]48[/link], [link]97[/link], etc.); delighting in it ([link]vv. 16[/link], [link]24[/link], [link]35[/link], etc.); tasting it ([link]v. 103[/link]); rejoicing in it ([link]vv. 14[/link], [link]111[/link], [link]162[/link]); singing of it ([link]v. 54[/link]; cf. [link]Eph. 5:18-20[/link]); regarding it ([link]vv. 6[/link], [link]117[/link]); having a sound heart in it ([link]v. 80[/link]); inclining their heart unto it ([link]vv. 36[/link], [link]112[/link]); seeking it ([link]vv. 45[/link], [link]94[/link]), longing for it ([link]vv. 20[/link], [link]40[/link], [link]131[/link]), and hoping in it with prayer ([link]vv. 43[/link], [link]74[/link], [link]114[/link], [link]147[/link]); trusting in it ([link]v. 42[/link]); musing on it ([link]vv. 15[/link], [link]23[/link], [link]48[/link], [link]78[/link], [link]99[/link], [link]148[/link]; see note [link]15[sup]1[/sup][/link]); considering it ([link]v. 95[/link]); esteeming it right concerning all things ([link]v. 128a[/link]); learning it ([link]vv. 71[/link], [link]73[/link]); treasuring it as much as all riches ([link]v. 14[/link]), as great spoil ([link]v. 162[/link]), better than gold and silver ([link]vv. 72[/link], [link]127[/link]), and as a heritage forever ([link]v. 111[/link]); treasuring it up in their heart ([link]v. 11[/link]; cf. [link]Col. 3:16[/link]); remembering it and not forgetting it ([link]vv. 52[/link], [link]16[/link], [link]93[/link]); standing in awe of it ([link]vv. 161b[/link], [link]120[/link]); clinging to it ([link]v. 31[/link]); not forsaking it, not swerving from it, not turning aside from it, and not going astray from it ([link]vv. 87[/link], [link]51[/link], [link]157[/link], [link]102[/link], [link]110[/link]); turning their feet toward it ([link]v. 59[/link]); keeping, observing, and doing it ([link]vv. 33[/link], [link]69[/link]); and walking in it and running the way of it ([link]vv. 1[/link], [link]32a[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">Christ is the reality of the law in the sense of its being not only the testimony of God but also the word of God. In total, He is the Word of God ([link]John 1:1[/link]; [link]Rev. 19:13b[/link]). The words of this psalm are the written words of God, but Christ is the living Word of God breathed out by God ([link]2 Tim. 3:16a[/link]). The written words are the letters, but the living Word is the Spirit ([link]John 6:63[/link]; [link]Eph. 6:17[/link]), who is the reality of the letters. The law is the person of Christ, and the person of Christ is the Spirit ([link]1 Cor. 15:45[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 3:17[/link]). The Spirit is the reality of whatever God is ([link]John 16:13[/link]; [link]1 John 5:6[/link]). Hence, as the Spirit, Christ is the reality of the law.</note>

        <note num="1">There are two aspects of the law &amp;#8212; the aspect of the letter and the aspect of the Spirit. "The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life" ([link]2 Cor. 3:6[/link]). If our attitude in coming to the law is to care only for the commandments in letters, we will have the law in the aspect of the killing letter. However, if we take every part of the law &amp;#8212; all the commandments, ordinances, statutes, precepts, and judgments &amp;#8212; as the word breathed out by the God whom we love, we will have the law in the aspect of the life-giving Spirit.[br][br]The function of the law also has two aspects. On the negative side, the law exposes man's sin ([link]Rom. 3:20b[/link]; [link]7:7b[/link]) and subdues sinners before God ([link]Rom. 3:19[/link]). It also guards God's chosen people in its custody that they might be conducted to Christ ([link]Gal. 3:23-24[/link]). On the positive side, as God's living testimony, the law functions to minister the living God to His seekers ([link]vv. 2[/link], [link]88[/link]), and as God's living word, the law functions to dispense God Himself as life and light into those who love the law ([link]vv. 25[/link], [link]116[/link], [link]130[/link]). See note [link]8[sup]1[/sup], par. 3, in Exo. 19[/link].</note>

        <note num="1">[link]Psalms 120-134[/link] are a particular group known as the Songs of Ascents. Instead of speaking concerning the law, these psalms are related to the matter of captivity. The people of Israel loved the law, but because they transgressed the law, even going so far as to turn from God and worship idols ([link]Jer. 2:13[/link]), God sent them into captivity in a land of idols. As the people were suffering in captivity, they could not forget Zion and Jerusalem, which were signs, symbols, of the very God whom they worshipped. When the people of Israel were captured, they were in a downward situation. To return to Jerusalem and to Zion was to be in an upward situation, to "go up" ([link]122:4[/link]). Jerusalem was built on Mount Zion. Therefore, when the people journeyed to Jerusalem, they had to ascend, and as they were ascending they sang a song of ascents.</note>
        <note num="2">[link]Psalm 120[/link] is the praise of a saint, in his going up to Zion, concerning Jehovah's delivering him from his distress, referring, perhaps, to the afflictions he suffered in his captivity.</note>

In a divine sense, however, it was a sowing through their preaching to the Gentiles concerning God. As a result, a number of Gentiles (sheaves) were brought to God through these captives. This indicates that the captives sowed the seed of the knowledge of God among the heathen. Cf. [link]Ruth 1:16[/link] and note 2.</note>

We cannot gain much by our toil, but we can produce spiritual children (cf. [link]1 Cor. 4:15[/link]). In addition to His caring for us, God blesses us with increase, with children. Increase does not depend on what we do; it depends on how much God gives. Both the care and the blessing come from Him.</note>

        <note num="1">The sequence of [link]Psa. 128-134[/link], the remaining seven Songs of Ascents, is significant. [link]Psalm 128[/link] speaks of Jehovah's blessing to Israel from Zion and the prosperity of Jerusalem in Israel's enjoyment. [link]Psalm 129[/link] concerns God's righteous dealing with the persecutors of Israel and the haters of Zion. Because Israel, like their persecutors and haters, has many sins and iniquities, [link]Psa. 130[/link] is a psalm of forgiveness and redemption. Then [link]Psa. 131[/link] indicates that after we experience God's forgiveness, we become humble and quiet before God. In such a situation God can rise up, enter into us, and take us as His resting place. This is Zion becoming God's habitation, His resting place, as revealed in [link]Psa. 132[/link]. Next, [link]Psa. 133[/link] shows that Zion, God's resting place, is the unique place where the brothers can come together in oneness and receive the commanded blessing of God, even life forever. Finally, in [link]Psa. 134[/link] the children of Israel first charge the priests to praise God in the night, and then they bless the priests, indicating that the children of Israel, having become Zion, are the highest people, even higher than the priests (cf. [link]Heb. 7:7[/link]).</note>

The oil running down from Aaron's head to the hem of his garments signifies that both the Head and the Body, both Christ and the church, are under the anointing of God's fine oil ([link]Heb. 1:9[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 1:21[/link]). The anointing of the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit is the element of the genuine oneness ([link]Eph. 4:3-4a[/link] and note [link]3[sup]2[/sup][/link]).</note>

[link]Psalm 133[/link] typifies the church living &amp;#8212; the highest living, a living in which the brothers dwell together in oneness.
