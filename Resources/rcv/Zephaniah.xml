        <text>The word of Jehovah that came to [note]1[/note]Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah, in the days of [xref]a[/xref]Josiah the son of Amon, the king of Judah.</text>
        <note num="1">Meaning [i]Jah hides[/i], or [i]Jah treasures[/i]; [i]Jah[/i] being a shortened form of [i]Jehovah[/i]. The name probably signifies being hidden by Jehovah as His treasure in the day of His anger ([link]2:3[/link]). As the son of Cushi, Zephaniah was a royal descendant who was related to two good kings of Judah, Hezekiah and Josiah.[br/][br/]The central thought of this book is that Jehovah is the judging and saving God both to Israel and to the nations, issuing in His reigning among Israel ([link]3:15b[/link]) and in Israel's singing and rejoicing in their restoration ([link]3:14[/link]). Jehovah judges Israel as well as the nations, and He saves the nations as well as Israel. His judgment and His salvation are universal. Jehovah's judgment on Israel and on the nations and His salvation to the Gentiles and to Israel have a particular order: His judgment is first on Israel and then on the nations (cf. [link]1 Pet. 4:17a[/link]), but His salvation is first to the Gentiles and then to Israel ([link]Rom. 11:11[/link], [link]25-26[/link]).</note>
