        <text>What the [note]1[/note]cutting [xref]a[/xref]locust has left, the swarming locust has eaten; / And what the swarming locust has left, the licking locust has eaten; / And what the licking locust has left, the consuming locust has eaten.</text>
        <note num="1">Four words for locust are used in this verse, probably referring to one kind of locust in various stages of growth. The four stages of this one kind of locust refer to the nations that devastated Israel in four consecutive empires: Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome, including Antichrist, who will be the last Caesar of the Roman Empire ([link]Rev. 17:8-11[/link]). The armies of these empires were like locusts ([link]2:25[/link]) coming to devastate and consume Israel totally, devouring her people, land, fields, produce, food, and drink and cutting off her offerings. These empires correspond to the four sections of the great human image in [link]Dan. 2[/link], to the four beasts in [link]Dan. 7[/link], and to the four horns in [link]Zech. 1[/link]. They will be overcome and terminated by Christ, who will set up the kingdom and reign among the saved Israel in the age of restoration ([link]ch. 3[/link]; [link]Dan. 2:34-35[/link] and notes).[br/][br/]Beginning approximately two hundred years before the coming of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, God sent the prophets to warn Israel, to advise them, and to call them to return to God. However, Israel did not listen to the prophets. This forced God to send the four kinds of locusts to chastise His people. Israel has been suffering the cutting, swarming, licking, and consuming of the locusts for twenty-seven centuries. God's purpose in allowing Israel to suffer under the locusts was to bring forth a couple, Joseph and Mary, so that God could be born in man, of man, and out of man to become no longer only God but a God-man (cf. [link]Matt. 1[/link]). Hence, God used the suffering of the Jews to bring in the incarnation, an unprecedented event that brought God into man and mingled God and man as one. Furthermore, God has used the locusts to afford all the necessary facilities in the environment for the carrying out of His purpose. The Roman Empire, the aggregate of the four empires, afforded everything necessary for the incarnated God to live and move and work on earth. It also provided the means for Christ to be crucified for the accomplishing of God's redemption ([link]John 18:31-32[/link]), the occasion for the pouring out of the Spirit as the processed and consummated Triune God upon all flesh to produce the church as the organic Body of Christ ([link]Acts 2[/link]), and the facilities for the spreading of the gospel to the entire inhabited earth ([link]Matt. 28:19[/link]; [link]Acts 1:8[/link]).[br/][br/]The Bible is a record of two histories: the history of man, the human history, and the history of God, the divine history. The former is like an outward shell, and the latter, like the kernel within the shell. In the Minor Prophets the human history is clearly defined and is signified by the four kinds of locusts mentioned in this verse. The divine history within the human history is also revealed in considerable detail. The divine history, as the divine mystery of the Triune God in humanity, began in eternity past with the eternal God and His eternal economy ([link]Micah 5:2c[/link]; [link]1 Tim. 1:4[/link]; [link]Eph. 1:4-5[/link], [link]9-11[/link]). It continues with Christ's incarnation ([link]Micah 5:2a[/link]); His death, burial, and resurrection for the spreading of God's redemption and salvation to all the nations on earth ([link]Jonah 1:17[/link]; [link]2:10[/link]); His pouring out of the consummated Spirit to produce the church as the corporate expression of the Triune God ([link]2:28-32[/link]); His second coming as the Desire of nations ([link]Hag. 2:7a[/link]) and as the Sun of righteousness ([link]Mal. 4:2a[/link]); His coming with His overcomers as His army to defeat Antichrist and his army ([link]3:1-15[/link]); and His reigning in Zion in the thousand-year kingdom ([link]3:16-21[/link]; [link]Micah 4:7[/link]). Eventually, the kingdom will consummate in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth for eternity. The New Jerusalem will be the ultimate, the consummate, step of God's history.</note>

        <note num="1">The day of Jehovah is the day of the Lord in the New Testament ([link]Acts 2:20[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 5:5[/link]; [link]1 Thes. 5:2[/link]; [link]2 Thes. 2:2[/link]; [link]2 Pet. 3:10[/link]), which is also the day of God ([link]2 Pet. 3:12[/link]). The final day of Jehovah will begin at the sixth seal ([link]Rev. 6:12-17[/link]) and end at the judgment of the great white throne ([link]Rev. 20:11-15[/link]). It will comprise various calamities, plagues, and woes for the Lord's punishing judgments and governmental dealings on the heavens, the sun, the moon, the stars, the earth, men, Satan, and the demons to clear up the earth and the entire universe for the coming of the new heaven and new earth ([link]Rev. 21:1[/link]) for His eternal kingdom. The time from the sixth seal to the beginning of the thousand-year kingdom will be a little more than three and a half years. The main part of that time will be the great tribulation ([link]Matt. 24:21[/link]). The judgment at the great white throne will take place after the thousand-year kingdom. Thus, the day of the Lord will last for about one thousand three and a half years. See note [link]12[sup]3[/sup] in 2 Pet. 3[/link].</note>

        <note num="1">The meal offering and the drink offering are blessings to Israel. When Nebuchadnezzar destroyed Jerusalem and the temple, Israel lost the place appointed by God where they could offer their offerings to God ([link]Deut. 12:5-6[/link]). Also, God's army of locusts ([link]v. 25[/link]) destroyed the produce of the land, leaving no grain to make a meal offering and no grapes to make wine for the drink offering. Thus, Israel lost both the ground and the materials to offer the meal offering to feed God and the drink offering to cheer God. Today both God and Israel are still suffering the loss of this blessing.</note>

        <note num="1">This prophecy concerning the pouring out of God's Spirit as the early rain for Israel's salvation was fulfilled as a foretaste by the pouring out of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost ([link]Acts 2:1-4[/link], [link]16-21[/link]), and it will be fulfilled as a full taste by the pouring out of the Spirit a second time, before the great tribulation ([link]Matt. 24:21[/link]), for the salvation and regeneration of many of the returned Israelites. This second outpouring is different from the pouring out of the Spirit as the late rain on the last day of the tribulation for the salvation of the remnant of the Jews under Antichrist's besieging ([link]Zech. 12:10[/link]).[br/][br/]In the Bible and in the Minor Prophets four things are unveiled: God's chastisement on His elect people, God's punishment of the nations, the manifestation of Christ, and the restoration. These four matters are covered in Joel, a short book of three chapters. First, God sent the locusts to consume Israel ([link]1:2-2:11[/link]). This was God's chastisement because of Israel's great evils. Then, this book reveals that God will punish and judge the Gentile nations because in their consuming of Israel they are excessive, acting without regard for justice ([link]3:1-16a[/link], [link]19[/link]). God's chastising of Israel and His punishing of the nations issue in the manifestation of Christ. Regarding this manifestation, Joel speaks here concerning the outpouring of the processed, consummated, compound Spirit, i.e., the Spirit of God compounded with Christ's humanity, Christ's death and its effectiveness, and Christ's resurrection with its power (see note [link]25[sup]1[/sup] in Exo. 30[/link]). This is the Holy Spirit, who was poured out on the day of Pentecost ([link]Acts 2:1-4[/link], [link]16-21[/link]), and this Spirit is the consummated Triune God and the realization of Christ for the manifestation of Christ. This manifestation began with the incarnation of Christ and has been confirmed and strengthened by the outpouring of the Spirit, for through that outpouring the individual Christ became the corporate Christ ([link]1 Cor. 12:12-13[/link]), the church as the great mystery of godliness, God manifested in the flesh ([link]1 Tim. 3:15-16[/link]). The church as the manifestation of Christ will bring in the glorious day of restoration, the age of the millennial kingdom ([link]3:16-21[/link]), in which Christ will be manifested in a fuller way. The restoration will consummate in the fullest manifestation of Christ in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth ([link]Rev. 21:1-2[/link]).

        <note num="1">As revealed in [link]vv. 30-31a[/link], God's saving of the returned Jews by pouring out His Spirit upon them the second time (see note [link]28[sup]1[/sup][/link], par. 1) will be accompanied by the natural calamities of the sixth seal and the first four trumpets ([link]Rev. 6:12-17[/link]; [link]8:7-12[/link]) on the heavens, the sun, the moon, the stars, and the earth as a prelude to the great tribulation ([link]Matt. 24:21[/link]). It will take place before the fifth trumpet, the first of the three woes ([link]Rev. 8:13[/link] and note), which are the major structure of the great tribulation, in the great and terrible day of Jehovah ([link]v. 31b[/link]). See note [link]12[sup]1[/sup] in Rev. 6[/link].[br/][br/]In spite of such an outpouring of the Spirit, many of the returned Jews will not believe but will continue to be stubborn. Eventually, during the tribulation, Jerusalem will be surrounded by the Gentile armies under Antichrist, whose intention will be to destroy Israel entirely ([link]Zech. 14:2[/link]; [link]Rev. 16:13-16[/link]). At that juncture the Lord Jesus Christ will descend with His overcomers, His mighty ones ([link]3:11[/link]). Furthermore, according to [link]Zech. 12:10[/link], at that time the consummated Spirit will again be poured out, and the remnant of the children of Israel will be saved. Thus, the three outpourings of the Holy Spirit &amp;#8212; on the day of Pentecost, just before the great tribulation, and at the Lord's second coming &amp;#8212; work together for the salvation of Israel.</note>

After Christ casts Antichrist and the false prophet into the lake of fire, He will set up His throne in Jerusalem, and all the living persons among the nations, as the goats and the sheep, will be gathered before Him to be judged by Him. The goats will be the evil ones, those who persecuted the Jews during the tribulation, and the sheep will be the good ones, those who helped the persecuted Jews ([link]Matt. 25:31-46[/link] and notes).</note>
