        <verse num="1">
        <text>[note]1[/note]These are the words which [note]2[/note]Moses spoke to all Israel across the Jordan in the wilderness, in the [note]3[/note]Arabah opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab.</text>
        <note num="1">Deuteronomy is a concluding word of the law and gives an all-inclusive conclusion to the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Bible, which were written by Moses. [i]Deuteronomy[/i] means [i]second law[/i] and thus signifies a respeaking, a repeated speaking, of the divine law. The law was given through Moses the first time when he was eighty ([link]Exo. 7:7[/link]). Forty years later, after the first generation, with the exception of Caleb and Joshua, had died out, the law was spoken again to the children of Israel, this time to the second generation, the generation that was ready to enter into the good land and possess it. Most of that generation had not been present to hear the giving of the Ten Commandments, the statutes, and the ordinances at Mount Sinai. Therefore, God burdened Moses to respeak, to rehearse, the law. This respeaking was a renewed training given to the new generation of the children of Israel after their long wandering, to prepare them to enter into the good land promised by God and inherit it as their possession.[br][br]In this book, as in the entire Bible, God is manifested, man is exposed, and Christ is unveiled. This book speaks of God as a God of love, righteousness, faithfulness, and blessing that man may know God's heart and God's government and may love God, trust in God, fear God, subject himself to God's ruling, mind the tender feelings of God, and live in the presence of God that he may be qualified to inherit the promised land. Furthermore, it exposes man, showing that in himself man is a failure, absolutely unable to fulfill the requirements of the holy, righteous, and faithful God, so that man may know his real condition and have no confidence in himself but put his trust in God, the One who is faithful ([link]7:9[/link]). Finally, this book unveils Christ in three aspects: (1) as the unique Prophet of God, as the divine oracle ([link]18:15-19[/link]); (2) as the all-inclusive good land, the goal, the aim, prepared for us by God ([link]8:7-10[/link]; [link]Col. 1:12[/link]; [link]Phil. 3:7-15[/link]); and (3) as the word of God ([link]8:3[/link]; [link]30:11-14[/link]; [link]John 1:1[/link]; [link]1 John 1:1[/link]) that we may receive Him as our life and our life supply and thus have the strength and ability to reach Him as the God-appointed goal. See notes [link book="Deut." chapter="8"]3[sup]1[/sup][/link] and [link]7[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 8[/link] and note [link]12[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 30[/link].</note>
        <note num="2">In Deuteronomy Moses as the spokesman of God was like an aged, loving father speaking to his children with much love and concern. Moses spoke for God for forty years, from the age of eighty ([link]Exo. 7:7[/link]) to the age of one hundred twenty ([link]34:7[/link]). He was a person not only soaked and saturated with the thought of God but also constituted with the speaking God Himself. Hence, the word that proceeded out of his mouth was the word of God.

        <note num="1">With a review of the past, on the one hand, this book points out God's leading that man may know the heart and the hand of God, so that man may trust in God and fear God; on the other hand, it points out man's failure that man may know himself, condemn the flesh, and learn how to reject the self and the flesh. With a view of the future, this book expects that, on the one hand, man may know the love and government of God and that, on the other hand, man may know his real condition, so that he will no longer trust in himself but will trust in God, the faithful One.</note>

        <note num="1">In [link]Matt. 4:4[/link] [i]everything[/i] is replaced by [i]every word,[/i] referring to the law, the commandments, the statutes, and the ordinances as the words that proceed out of the mouth of God. All the words in this book are God's breathing ([link]2 Tim. 3:16[/link]), and all refer to Christ, who is the totality of God's word ([link]John 1:1[/link]; [link]Rev. 19:13[/link]) to be the life and life supply of God's people. Therefore, to live by every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God is to live by Christ, the embodiment of the divine breath ([link]John 6:57[/link], [link]63[/link]). God was leading His people into the good land, a type of Christ, by Christ, and He was sustaining them on their way to the good land also by Christ, who is everything that proceeds out through the mouth of God. See notes [link]1[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 6[/link] and [link]12[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 30[/link].[br][br]God wants us to fulfill His righteous requirements for the accomplishing of His divine economy; however, He does not want us to do this in ourselves. Rather, He wants us to live, work, and have our being in Christ, by Christ, with Christ, through Christ, and in oneness with Christ ([link]Gal. 2:20[/link]). God's desire is that we put ourselves aside, forget ourselves, and fulfill His economy by the Spirit, i.e., by the realization of the Son, who is the embodiment of the Father ([link]John 14:17-18[/link], [link]10[/link]). The Scriptures as the breathing, the exhaling, of God are the embodiment of Christ as the life-giving Spirit ([link]John 6:63[/link]; [link]Eph. 6:17[/link]). By inhaling the word of the Scriptures, we receive the Spirit ([link]Eph. 6:17-18a[/link]; [link]Gal. 3:5[/link]) and enjoy the riches of Christ and thus are enabled to fulfill God's requirements.</note>

        <text>For Jehovah your God is bringing you to a [note]1[/note]good land, a [xref]a[/xref]land of waterbrooks, of springs and of [note]2[/note]fountains, flowing forth in valleys and in mountains;</text>
        <note num="1">The good land, the land of Canaan, is a full, complete, and consummate type of the all-inclusive Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God ([link]Col. 2:9[/link]) realized as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit ([link]1 Cor. 15:45[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 3:17[/link]), as the inheritance allotted to God's people for their enjoyment ([link]Col. 1:12[/link] and note 2; [link]2:6-7[/link] and note [link]6[sup]2[/sup][/link]; [link]Gal. 3:14[/link] and note 3). The riches of the good land in [link]vv. 7-9[/link] typify the unsearchable riches of Christ in different aspects ([link]Eph. 3:8[/link]) as the bountiful supply to His believers in His Spirit ([link]Phil. 1:19[/link]). The waterbrooks, springs, and fountains signify Christ as the flowing Spirit ([link]John 4:14[/link]; [link]7:37-39[/link]; [link]Rev. 22:1[/link]), and the valleys and mountains signify the different kinds of environments in which we may experience Christ as the flowing Spirit (cf. [link]2 Cor. 6:8-10[/link]). Wheat typifies the incarnated Christ, who was crucified and buried to multiply Himself ([link]John 12:24[/link]), and barley, being the first-ripe grain ([link]2 Sam. 21:9[/link]), points to the resurrected Christ as the firstfruits ([link]1 Cor. 15:20[/link]). Vines typify the Christ who sacrificed Himself to produce wine to cheer God and man ([link]Judg. 9:13[/link]; [link]Matt. 9:17[/link]). The fig tree speaks of the sweetness and satisfaction of Christ as the life supply ([link]Judg. 9:11[/link]); the pomegranates signify the fullness, the abundance and beauty, and the expression of the riches of Christ as life ([link]Exo. 28:33-34[/link]; [link]1 Kings 7:18-20[/link]; [link]S.S. 4:3b[/link], [link]13[/link]); the bread signifies Christ as the bread of life ([link]John 6:35[/link], [link]48[/link]); the olive tree typifies Christ ([link]Rom. 11:17[/link]) as the One who was filled with the Spirit and anointed with the Spirit ([link]Luke 4:1[/link], [link]18[/link]; [link]Heb. 1:9[/link]); olive oil typifies the Holy Spirit, by whom we walk to honor God and whom we minister to honor man ([link]Gal. 5:16[/link], [link]25[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 3:6[/link], [link]8[/link]; [link]Judg. 9:9[/link]); and milk and honey ([link]6:3[/link]) speak forth the goodness and sweetness of Christ (see note [link]8[sup]2[/sup] in Exo. 3[/link]). Stones signify Christ as material for building God's dwelling place ([link]Isa. 28:16[/link]; [link]Zech. 4:7[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 2:4[/link]). The iron and copper are for making weapons ([link]Gen. 4:22[/link]; [link]1 Sam. 17:5-7[/link]) and typify our spiritual warfare by which we fight the enemy ([link]2 Cor. 10:4[/link]; [link]Eph. 6:10-20[/link]). Iron also signifies Christ's ruling authority ([link]Matt. 28:18[/link]; [link]Rev. 19:15[/link]), and copper, Christ's judging power ([link]Rev. 1:15[/link] and note 1). The mountains from which copper is mined signify Christ's resurrection and ascension ([link]Eph. 4:8[/link] and note 1).[br][br]God's goal in His economy is not merely to redeem His people and save them from the world, typified by Egypt, but to bring them into Christ, typified by the good land, that they may possess Him and enjoy His unsearchable riches. By enjoying the riches of the land, the children of Israel were able to build up the temple to be God's habitation on earth and the city of Jerusalem to establish God's kingdom on earth. Likewise, by enjoying the unsearchable riches of Christ, the believers in Christ are built up to be Christ's Body, the church, which is Christ's fullness, His expression ([link]Eph. 1:22-23[/link]), and which is also the habitation of God ([link]Eph. 2:21-22[/link]; [link]1 Tim. 3:15[/link]) and the kingdom of God ([link]Matt. 16:18-19[/link]; [link]Rom. 14:17[/link]). Ultimately, God's habitation and God's kingdom will consummate in the New Jerusalem in eternity for the fulfillment of God's eternal economy ([link]Rev. 21:1-3[/link], [link]22[/link]; [link]22:1[/link], [link]3[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">God's ways are actually what God is. Whatever God is, is a way to us. Hence, to take what God is as our ways and to walk in these ways is to live God. The God who is our way is Christ ([link]John 14:6[/link]). To take Christ as our way is to live Him, and to live Him is to express Him, to manifest Him, and even to magnify Him ([link]Phil. 1:20-21a[/link]). In the New Jerusalem the river of water of life proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb and flowing in the middle of the street of gold ([link]Rev. 22:1[/link]) indicates that God is both our life and our way. We take God as our life, and His life with His nature then becomes the way on which we walk. See note [link]1[sup]6[/sup] in Rev. 22[/link].</note>
        <note num="2">God Himself set an example of loving by setting His affection on His people ([link]vv. 14-15[/link]; [link]7:7-8[/link]). In Deuteronomy God was actually "courting" His people, loving them and setting His affection upon them (cf. note [link]6[sup]2[/sup] in Exo. 20[/link]). His people should love Him in return by setting their affection on Him. See note [link]9[sup]3[/sup] in 1 Cor. 2[/link].</note>
        <note num="3">Our heart is linked to our spirit, for our conscience, which is a function of our spirit ([link]Rom. 9:1[/link]), is also a function of our heart ([link]Heb. 10:22[/link]). Thus, to love and serve God with all our heart and soul indicates that we love and serve Him also with our spirit ([link]Rom. 1:9[/link]). Furthermore, according to [link]6:5[/link] we are to love Him also with all our might, that is, with our physical strength. See [link]Mark 12:28-30[/link] and note [link]30[sup]1[/sup][/link].</note>

        <note num="1">The children of Israel were not allowed to worship God and enjoy the offerings they presented to God in the place of their choice ([link]vv. 8[/link], [link]13[/link], [link]17[/link]). They were to worship God in the place of His choice, the place where His name, His habitation, and His altar were ([link]vv. 5-6[/link]), by bringing their tithes, offerings, and sacrifices to Him there ([link]vv. 5[/link], [link]11[/link], [link]14[/link], [link]18[/link], [link]21[/link], [link]26-27[/link]; [link]14:22-23[/link]; [link]15:19-20[/link]). To fulfill these requirements was to have a unique center of worship, as Jerusalem would be later ([link]2 Chron. 6:5-6[/link]; [link]John 4:20[/link]), for the keeping of the oneness among God's people, thus avoiding the division caused by man's preferences (cf. [link]1 Kings 12:26-33[/link] and notes).[br][br]The revelation in the New Testament concerning the worship of God corresponds to the revelation in this chapter in at least four ways: First, the people of God should always be one; there should be no divisions among them ([link]Psa. 133[/link]; [link]John 17:11[/link], [link]21-23[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 1:10[/link]; [link]Eph. 4:3[/link]). Second, the unique name into which God's people should gather is the name of the Lord Jesus Christ ([link]Matt. 18:20[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 1:12[/link] and notes), the reality of which name is the Spirit ([link]1 Cor. 12:3[/link]). To be designated by any other name is to be denominated, divided; this is spiritual fornication (see note [link]8[sup]3[/sup] in Rev. 3[/link]). Third, in the New Testament God's habitation, His dwelling place, is particularly located in our spirit, i.e., in our mingled spirit, our human spirit regenerated and indwelt by the divine Spirit ([link]John 3:6b[/link]; [link]Rom. 8:16[/link]; [link]2 Tim. 4:22[/link]; [link]Eph. 2:22[/link]). In our meeting for the worship of God, we must exercise our spirit and do everything in our spirit ([link]John 4:24[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 14:15[/link]). Fourth, in our worship of God we must have the genuine application of the cross of Christ, signified by the altar, by rejecting the flesh, the self, and the natural life and worshipping God with Christ and Christ alone ([link]Matt. 16:24[/link]; [link]Gal. 2:20[/link]). Hence, the meeting of God's people for the worship of God should be in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, in the mingled spirit as the place of God's habitation, in the place where the cross is, and with the enjoyment of Christ as the reality of the tithes, the offerings, and the sacrifices (see note [link]24[sup]4[/sup] in John 4[/link]). This is the oneness of God's people, and this is the proper ground for the worship of God.</note>

        <note num="1">Moses' word in [link]chs. 12[/link] and [link book="Deut."]13[/link] charges God's people to avoid division and reject apostasy. Apostasy in the Old Testament denotes giving up God and turning away from God to idols. In the New Testament apostasy is heresy, denoting the denial of Christ's deity; it refers to not believing that Jesus Christ is God incarnated to be a man ([link]John 1:1[/link], [link]14[/link]; [link]1 John 2:18[/link], [link]22[/link]; [link]4:2-3[/link]). Apostasy, or heresy, insults God and damages the person of Christ, and division destroys the Body of Christ as Christ's corporate expression. Thus, apostasy and division damage the entire economy of God. Because of this, the apostle Paul charges us to turn away from the divisive ones ([link]Rom. 16:17[/link]), and the apostle John enjoins us to reject the heretical ones ([link]2 John 9-11[/link]). Like Moses in this book and the apostles in the New Testament, we must be very strict concerning division and apostasy. We must keep the unique oneness of God's people and the unique faith in the person and redemptive work of Christ ([link]Eph. 4:3[/link], [link]13[/link] and notes [link]3[sup]1[/sup][/link] and [link]13[sup]2[/sup][/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">The divine government among God's people is neither autocracy nor democracy but theocracy &amp;#8212; a direct ruling and governing by God Himself according to what He is. Among the children of Israel in the Old Testament God governed His people according to His constant speaking, as written in the law, and His instant speaking, as revealed either through the breastplate of the high priest by means of the Urim and Thummim or through the prophets by the Spirit of God coming upon certain ones to enable them to speak God's word ([link]Exo. 28:30[/link] and notes; [link]Lev. 8:8[/link]; [link]Num. 27:21[/link]; [link]Deut. 33:8[/link]; [link]1 Sam. 28:6[/link]; [link]Ezra 2:63[/link]; [link]Neh. 7:65[/link]). Moreover, God's government was executed through some human agents: the priests and the elders, the judges, or the kings as direct administrators, who worked together for God's theocracy. In the church in the New Testament the teaching of the apostles ([link]Acts 2:42[/link]) replaces the law in God's administration, and the elders of the churches ([link]Acts 14:23[/link]; [link]Titus 1:5[/link]) are the direct administrators, who administrate according to the teaching of the apostles ([link]1 Tim. 3:2[/link]; [link]5:17[/link]). In relation to the instant speaking of the Lord, all the believers in Christ, including the elders, are priests to God ([link]1 Pet. 2:5[/link]; [link]Rev. 1:6[/link]), having Christ as the High Priest living within them ([link]Heb. 8:1[/link]; [link]Rom. 8:10[/link]) and having the Holy Spirit mingled with their regenerated human spirit ([link]Rom. 8:16[/link]) to replace the function of the Urim and Thummim. Among the believers, the prophets and teachers help the eldership and the priesthood ([link]Acts 13:1-4[/link]). See note [link]1[sup]1[/sup] in Ezra 5[/link].</note>

Second, in the presence of God the priest would consider God's holy word. Third, the Levitical priests had the breastplate with the Urim and Thummim ([link]33:8[/link]), which provided instant enlightenment ([link]Exo. 28:30[/link] and notes). Eventually, through the presence of God, the word of God, and the Urim and Thummim, the priest would gain a clear understanding of the divine judgment and then pass on this judgment to the presiding judge. The judge would then make a judgment according to what the priest had received from God and passed on to him. The judgment of the case, therefore, came through man, but it was of God and according to God &amp;#8212; a matter of theocracy. See note [link]18[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 16[/link].</note>

In order to administrate, to manage, the church, the elders must be reconstituted with the holy word of God ([link]1 Tim. 3:2[/link]; [link]5:17[/link]). As a result, they will be under God's government, under God's rule and control. Then spontaneously God will be in their decisions, and the elders will represent God to manage the affairs of the church.

Although Christ has been allotted to us by God as our portion ([link]Col. 1:12[/link]), if we would possess Christ and live in Christ as our land, we still need to fight against the spiritual enemies (see note [link]1[sup]1[/sup] in Num. 21[/link]). We should not only pray but also fight. Actually, we are not the ones fighting, for God goes with us and fights for us. It is our duty to fight, but we cannot fulfill this duty by ourselves but only by faith in the Lord, i.e., by the Lord Himself as our life and life supply. We can fulfill the Lord's requirements only by the divine life, the eternal life, which is the Triune God embodied in Christ ([link]John 14:6[/link]; [link]1 John 5:11-12[/link]), who is realized as the life-giving Spirit ([link]John 14:16-20[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 15:45[/link]).

        <note num="1">The children of Israel, being fallen in nature, surely would not measure up to keeping the commandments, statutes, and ordinances of their God; thus, they would come under all the curses listed in [link]vv. 15-26[/link]. However, right beside the stones containing the inscriptions of the commandments of God was the altar, signifying the cross of Christ, where God's people could take Christ, in type, as their burnt offering to God for His satisfaction and as their peace offering to God for their enjoyment with God in the divine fellowship ([link]vv. 6-7[/link]). Through Christ God's people, who were cursed under God's commandments, statutes, and ordinances, have been redeemed "out of the curse of the law" ([link]Gal. 3:13[/link]). Because we as God's people have come to the cross, we are now under the cross (implying grace) and are no longer under the law ([link]Rom. 6:14[/link]). As those who are under the cross, we can satisfy God and can also find satisfaction for ourselves through Christ, our Redeemer and our Substitute. Through Christ, who is our peace, we have peace with God ([link]Eph. 2:14a[/link]; [link]Rom. 5:1[/link]). The law is over, and the cross stands forever. This is the reason that the altar was prepared before the curses were declared.[br][br]The scene at the entry of the good land portrayed in [link]vv. 1-8[/link] includes the stone monuments, the altar, and the offerings. The law written on the monuments was a portrait of God Himself (see note [link]1[sup]1[/sup] in Exo. 20[/link]); hence, the monuments signify that Christ as the embodiment of God was standing before the people to make requirements of them according to what He is. The offerings burned on the altar as sacrifices for God's satisfaction also signify Christ as the One who meets and satisfies all God's requirements. Thus, the requiring God Himself came in incarnation to be our Redeemer and our Substitute as the fulfilling One. This wonderful scene shows that it is through the requiring God, the cross of Christ, and Christ Himself as the offerings, not by our endeavoring in ourselves, that we enter into Christ, our good land, and receive all the blessings that God would give us in Christ. These blessings are the processed Triune God Himself embodied in Christ (see note [link]7[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 8[/link]).</note>

In His governmental dealing with His people, God is wise, loving, sympathetic, patient, purposeful, and successful. God's severe chastisement of the children of Israel does not mean that He has given them up ([link]Rom. 11:1-5[/link], [link]11-12[/link], [link]23-32[/link]). On the contrary, God is chastising them for their perfecting. The principle is the same with the New Testament believers ([link]Heb. 12:5-11[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">In [link]Rom. 10:6-8[/link] Paul applies the word spoken by Moses in [link]vv. 11-14[/link] to Christ, indicating that the commandment, which is the word of God ([link]vv. 11[/link], [link]14[/link]), is Christ as the Word ([link]John 1:1[/link]; [link]Rev. 19:13[/link]), who, as the breath that proceeds out of God's mouth (cf. [link]8:3[/link]; [link]2 Tim. 3:16a[/link]), is in our heart and in our mouth (see note [link]8[sup]1[/sup] in Rom. 10[/link]). As the Word of God, the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Christ Himself, who has become the life-giving Spirit as the breath breathed out by the speaking God ([link]1 Cor. 15:45[/link]; [link]John 20:22[/link]), is the word of the law &amp;#8212; including the commandments, the statutes, and the ordinances (judgments) &amp;#8212; rehearsed by Moses in this book.

        <note num="1">Many things in the song of Moses are severe, but the ending is very positive. No matter how evil the children of Israel might be and no matter how much God might be provoked in His anger toward them, the result, the issue, will be good. Instead of forsaking His people, God will eventually come in to vindicate them ([link]Isa. 2:2-3[/link]; [link]Zech. 8:20-23[/link]).

        <note num="1">Ultimately, this book shows us that the love of God consummately works for His people that they may enjoy His full blessing according to His will and foreknowledge. In spite of the failure of God's people in loving God and fearing Him and in spite of their unfaithfulness, God will be faithful to the end ([link]2 Tim. 2:13[/link]), and eventually He will accomplish His intention that His people may enjoy His full blessing. God's chosen people eventually entered into the Holy Land, possessed it, lived in it, and enjoyed it. This corresponds with the revelation of the entire Bible, which shows that in spite of the unfaithfulness, defeat, and failure of God's people, God will still enable His chosen people to enter into the rich Christ to possess Him, enjoy Him, experience Him, and even live Him (cf. [link]Phil. 3:7-14[/link]; [link]1:19-21[/link]). This is God's success, and the boast and glory belong to no one other than Him.</note>
