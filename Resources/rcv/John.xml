        <note num="1">[i]In the beginning[/i] means in eternity past. As the introduction to this Gospel, this chapter begins in eternity past with God, who had divinity but not humanity ([link]v. 1[/link]); it then passes through His creation of all things ([link]v. 3[/link]), His incarnation ([link]v. 14[/link]), His becoming the Lamb who takes away the sin of the world ([link]v. 29[/link]), and His being the Spirit who causes the believers to be transformed into living stones for His building ([link]vv. 32[/link], [link]42[/link]), and continues all the way to eternity future, in which the Son of Man, who has both divinity and humanity, is the center for the communication between heaven and earth and for the union of God and man in eternity. After this, [link]ch. 2[/link] shows that the principle of the Triune God as life is to change death into life ([link]2:1-11[/link]) and that the purpose of life is to build the house, the temple, of God ([link]2:13-22[/link]). In [link]chs. 3-11[/link], nine cases are given to illustrate how God as life meets the different needs of different kinds of people. As a result, in the beginning of [link]ch. 12[/link] a miniature of the church is produced ([link]12:1-11[/link]). From [link]12:12[/link] to the end of [link]ch. 17[/link] an explanation is given concerning how the church is produced through the multiplication and increase of the incarnated God-man by means of His death and resurrection. [link]Chapters 18-20[/link] show the accomplishing of the multiplication and increase, which causes Him to have many brothers ([link]20:17[/link]) and enables Him to enter into them ([link]20:22[/link]) to be their life and everything that they may be constituted His Body as His increase and expression. Finally, [link]ch. 21[/link] reveals that He will be with them in an invisible way until His coming back ([link]21:22[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">The Word is the definition, explanation, and expression of God; hence, it is God defined, explained, and expressed.</note>
        <note num="3">The Word is not separate from God. It is not that the Word is the Word and God is God, and that they are thus separate from each other. Rather, the two are one; hence, the next clause says that the Word was God.</note>

        <note num="2">In the beginning, that is, from eternity past, the Word was with God. Contrary to what is supposed by some, it is not that Christ was not with God and was not God from eternity past, and that at a certain time Christ became God and was with God. Christ's deity is eternal and absolute. From eternity past to eternity future, He is with God and He is God. This is why this Gospel, unlike Matthew ([link]ch. 1[/link]) and Luke ([link]ch. 3[/link]), has no genealogy of Christ ([link]Heb. 7:3[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">Since [link]v. 3[/link] refers to the creation in [link]Gen. 1[/link], [i]life[/i] here should refer to the life signified by the tree of life in [link]Gen. 2[/link].

Since life is in Him, He is life ([link]11:25[/link]; [link]14:6[/link]), and He came that man might have life ([link]10:10b[/link]). The introduction to this Gospel is composed of this entire chapter; it begins with life ([link]v. 4[/link]) and ends with building ([link]vv. 42[/link], [link]51[/link]), that is, with the house of God (see notes [link]42[sup]1[/sup][/link], [link]51[sup]2[/sup][/link], and [link]51[sup]3[/sup][/link]).

        <note num="1">For the Word as God to become flesh is for God to have the human life and the human nature.</note>
        <note num="2">[link]Romans 8:3[/link] indicates that although this flesh was the flesh of sin, it had only the likeness of the flesh of sin and did not have the sin of the flesh. It is the Word who became such flesh, and this Word was God, the complete Triune God ([link]v. 1[/link]). That the Word became flesh means that the Triune God became a man of flesh in the likeness of a sinful man. By so doing God entered into sinful man and became one with sinful man. However, He had only the likeness of a sinful man and not the sin of a sinful man. Hence, He was a sinless God-man, the complete God and the perfect man, having two natures, the divine nature and the human nature. Although His two natures were mingled to produce a God-man, the individual characteristics of the two natures remained distinct; the two natures did not intermix to form a third nature. Rather, the divine nature existed in the human nature and was expressed through the human nature, full of grace, which is God enjoyed by man, and reality, which is God obtained by man. In this way the invisible God was expressed so that men can obtain and enjoy Him as their life for the fulfillment of His New Testament economy.[br][br]God's becoming flesh was contrary to the teaching of the Gnostics of that time. The Gnostics maintained that since the flesh is an evil substance, God, who is pure, could never be united with the evil flesh. Using the teaching of the Gnostics as a basis, the Docetists denied that Christ had come in the flesh ([link]1 John 4:2[/link]). John wrote this Gospel in part to refute the heresy of the Docetists and to prove strongly that Christ, the God-man, is indeed God who became flesh (having only the likeness of the flesh of sin but not the sin of the flesh) that through this flesh, on the one hand, He might destroy the devil ([link]Heb. 2:14[/link]) and put away the sins of man ([link]Heb. 9:26[/link]), and, on the other hand, God might be united with man and be expressed through humanity for the fulfillment of His glorious purpose, a purpose He planned in eternity past for eternity future.[br][br]The deep thought of the Gospel of John is that Christ, the incarnate God, came as the embodiment of God, as illustrated by the tabernacle ([link]v. 14[/link]) and the temple ([link]2:21[/link]), so that man could contact Him and enter into Him to enjoy the riches contained in God. Both the tabernacle and the temple had an outer court, a Holy Place, and a Holy of Holies. Therefore, John points out first that Christ was the Lamb (who took away sin &amp;#8212; [link]v. 29[/link]) offered on the altar, which signifies the cross, in the outer court of the tabernacle, and then that He was like the bronze serpent (which caused man to have life) lifted up on the pole ([link]3:14[/link]), which signifies the cross. This shows how Christ in His redemption was received by His believers that they might be delivered from sin and obtain life and might enter into Him as the embodiment of God, typified by the tabernacle, to enjoy all the riches that are in God. The foot-washing in [link]ch. 13[/link] may be considered the washing in the laver in the outer court of the tabernacle, which washed away the earthly defilement of those who drew near to God, so that their fellowship with God and with one another could be maintained. In [link]ch. 14[/link] those who receive Christ are brought by Him into the Holy Place to experience Him as the bread of life ([link]6:35[/link]), signified by the showbread, and as the light of life ([link]8:12[/link]; [link]9:5[/link]), signified by the lampstand. Eventually, in [link]ch. 17[/link], through the highest and most mysterious prayer, which is typified by the burning incense on the golden incense altar, those who enjoy Christ as life and as light are brought by Him into the Holy of Holies to enter with Him into the deepest enjoyment of God and to enjoy the glory that God has given Him ([link]17:22-24[/link]).</note>
        <note num="3">The Word, by being incarnated, not only brought God into humanity but also became a tabernacle to God as God's habitation on earth among men.</note>
        <note num="4">This refers to Christ's transfiguration on the Mount ([link]Matt. 17:1-2[/link], [link]5[/link]; [link]Luke 9:32[/link]; [link]2 Pet. 1:16-18[/link]).</note>

Christ as the Son of Man, with His humanity, is the ladder set up on the earth and leading to heaven, keeping heaven open to earth and joining earth to heaven for the house of God, Bethel. Jacob poured oil (a symbol of the Holy Spirit, the ultimate expression of the Triune God reaching man) upon the stone (a symbol of the transformed man) that it might be the house of God. Here in this chapter are the Spirit ([link]v. 32[/link]) and the stone ([link]v. 42[/link]) for the house of God with Christ in His humanity. Where this is, there is an open heaven.</note>
        <note num="3">This chapter, as the introduction to this Gospel, introduces Christ as both the Son of God ([link]vv. 34[/link], [link]49[/link]) and the Son of Man. Nathanael recognized Him as the Son of God and addressed Him as such ([link]v. 49[/link]), but Christ said to Nathanael that He was the Son of Man. The Son of God is God; as such, He has the divine nature. The Son of Man is man; as such, He possesses the human nature. For the declaring of God ([link]v. 18[/link]) and for the bringing of God to man, He is the only begotten Son of God. But for the building of God's habitation on earth among men, He is the Son of Man. God's building needs His humanity. In eternity past Christ was only God, only the Son of God, and had only divinity; but in eternity future Christ, as God and man and as the Son of God and the Son of Man, will have both divinity and humanity forever.</note>

To be born anew is to be regenerated with the divine life, a life different from the human life received by natural birth. Hence, his real need was not better teachings by which he could improve himself, but the divine life by which he could be remade. He was seeking for teachings, which belong to the tree of knowledge, but the Lord's answer turned him to his need for life, which belongs to the tree of life (cf.

Now Nicodemus, one of the Pharisees, was conversing with the Lord, and the Lord spoke these familiar words.

"Spirit" is the central concept of the ministry of Jesus, that is, to germinate people in the new creation. These two main concepts together constitute the concept of regeneration.

        <note num="1">This chapter deals with regeneration. Regeneration, on one hand, brings the divine life with the divine nature into us. On the other hand, regeneration terminates the evil nature of Satan in our flesh. In [link]Gen. 3[/link] Satan, the serpent, injected his nature into man's flesh. When the children of Israel sinned against God, they were bitten by serpents ([link]Num. 21:4-9[/link]). God told Moses to lift up a bronze serpent on their behalf for God's judgment, that by looking upon that bronze serpent all might live. That was a type. Here, in this verse, the Lord Jesus applied that type to Himself, indicating that when He was in the flesh, He was in "the likeness of the flesh of sin" ([link]Rom. 8:3[/link]), which likeness is equal to the form of the bronze serpent. The bronze serpent had the form of the serpent but was without the serpent's poison. Christ was made in "the likeness of the flesh of sin," but He did not participate in any way in the sin of the flesh ([link]2 Cor. 5:21[/link]; [link]Heb. 4:15[/link]). When He was lifted up in the flesh on the cross, by His death Satan, the old serpent, was dealt with ([link]12:31-33[/link]; [link]Heb. 2:14[/link]). This means that the serpentine nature within fallen man has been dealt with. When a man is regenerated with the divine life in Christ, his satanic nature is annulled. Because of this, in this portion of the Word, when the Lord revealed the matter of regeneration to Nicodemus, He specifically mentioned this point.[br][br]Nicodemus might have considered himself a moral and good man. But the Lord's word in this verse implied that regardless of how good Nicodemus might have been outwardly, he had the serpentine nature of Satan inwardly. As a descendant of Adam, he had been poisoned by the old serpent, and the serpent's nature was within him. He needed the Lord not only to be the Lamb of God to take away his sin ([link]1:29[/link]) but also to be in the form of the serpent that his serpentine nature might be dealt with on the cross and that he might have eternal life. In the principle set forth in [link]ch. 2[/link], this is the changing of death into life.</note>

        <note num="1">The world here refers to sinful, fallen people, who constitute the world. They have not only sin but also the poisonous element of the devil, the ancient serpent; hence, they have become serpents. They need Christ to die for them in the form of a serpent and be judged by God as their Substitute ([link]v. 14[/link]); otherwise, they will perish ([link]v. 16[/link]). Although men are utterly fallen, God still loves them with His divine love, which is Himself ([link]1 John 4:8[/link], [link]16[/link]), because they are vessels created by God according to His own image to contain Himself ([link]Gen. 1:26[/link]; [link]Rom. 9:21a[/link], [link]23[/link]). Moreover, He so loves them that He gave them His only begotten Son, His expression, that they might obtain His eternal life to become His many sons and be His corporate expression for the fulfillment of His eternal New Testament economy. Hence, God first regenerates them by His Spirit ([link]vv. 3-6[/link]) that they may have His eternal life ([link]vv. 15-16[/link], [link]36a[/link]). Then He fills them with His unlimited Spirit ([link]v. 34[/link]) that they may become the bride of Christ, who is above all and is all-inclusive ([link]vv. 31-35[/link]), to be His increase and fullness ([link]vv. 28-30[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">Believing into the Lord is not the same as believing Him ([link]6:30[/link]). To believe Him is to believe that He is true and real, but to believe into Him is to receive Him and be united with Him as one.

The last two points, the annulling of the serpentine nature in the believers and the believers' being made the bride of Christ, are fully developed in John's Revelation. The book of Revelation reveals mainly how Satan as the old serpent will be fully eliminated ([link]Rev. 20:2[/link], [link]10[/link]) and how Christ's bride, the New Jerusalem, will be fully produced ([link]Rev. 21:2[/link], [link]10-27[/link]).</note>

From that time the Samaritans became a people of mixed heathen and Jewish blood. History tells us that they had the Pentateuch (the five books of Moses) and worshipped God according to that part of the Old Testament. But they were never recognized by the Jews as being part of the Jewish people.</note>

According to typology, God should be worshipped (1) in the place chosen by God for His habitation ([link]Deut. 12:5[/link], [link]11[/link], [link]13-14[/link], [link]18[/link]), and (2) with the offerings ([link]Lev. 1-6[/link]). The place chosen by God for His habitation typifies the human spirit, where God's habitation is today ([link]Eph. 2:22[/link]). The offerings typify Christ; Christ is the fulfillment and reality of all the offerings with which the people worshipped God. Hence, when the Lord instructed the woman to worship God the Spirit in spirit and truthfulness, He meant that she should contact God the Spirit in her spirit instead of in a specific location, and through Christ instead of with the offerings. Since Christ, as the reality that issues in the human virtue of truthfulness, has come ([link]vv. 25-26[/link]), all the shadows and types are over.</note>
        <note num="5">According to the context of this chapter and the entire revelation of John's Gospel, [i]truthfulness[/i] here denotes the divine reality becoming man's genuineness and sincerity (which are the opposite of the hypocrisy of the immoral Samaritan worshipper &amp;#8212; [link]vv. 16-18[/link]) for the true worship of God. The divine reality is Christ (who is the reality &amp;#8212; [link]14:6[/link]) as the reality of all the offerings of the Old Testament for the worship of God ([link]1:29[/link]; [link]3:14[/link]) and as the fountain of the living water, the life-giving Spirit ([link]vv. 7-15[/link]), partaken of and drunk by His believers to be the reality within them, which eventually becomes their genuineness and sincerity in which they worship God with the worship that He seeks.

The holy city, the holy temple, the feast, the Sabbath, the angels, Moses, and the Scriptures are all good things of this religion, but they could do nothing for this impotent man. In the eyes of the Lord he was a dead person ([link]v. 25[/link]), in need not only of healing but also of enlivening. With the Lord's enlivening there is no requirement. The impotent man heard His voice and was enlivened ([link]v. 25[/link]).</note>

The barley loaves represent Christ in resurrection as food to us.[br][br]Barley loaves and fish are small items, signifying Christ's smallness, through which He can be the life supply to us. Those who sought miracles considered Him the promised Prophet and would have forced Him to be King ([link]vv. 14-15[/link]), but He would not seek to be a giant in religion; rather, He preferred to be small loaves and little fish that people might eat Him.</note>

        <note num="2">Here flesh and blood are mentioned separately. The separation of blood and flesh indicates death. Here the Lord clearly indicated His death, that is, His being slain. He gave His body and shed His blood for us that we may have eternal life. To eat His flesh is to receive by faith all that He did in giving His body for us; and to drink His blood is to receive by faith all that He accomplished in shedding His blood for us. To eat His flesh and drink His blood is to receive Him, in His redemption, as life and the life supply by believing in what He did for us on the cross. By comparing this verse with [link]v. 47[/link], we see that to eat the Lord's flesh and drink His blood is to believe in Him, because to believe or to believe into is to receive ([link]1:12[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">At this point the Spirit who gives life is brought in. After resurrection and through resurrection, the Lord Jesus, who had become flesh ([link]1:14[/link]), became the Spirit who gives life, as is clearly mentioned in [link]1 Cor. 15:45[/link]. It is as the life-giving Spirit that He can be life and the life supply to us. When we receive Him as the crucified and resurrected Savior, the Spirit who gives life comes into us to impart eternal life into us. We receive the Lord Jesus, but we get the Spirit who gives life.</note>
        <note num="2">[i]Flesh[/i] here, according to the context, refers to the meat of the physical body. When the Lord said, "The bread which I will give is My flesh" ([link]v. 51[/link]), the Jews thought that He would give them the meat of His physical body to eat ([link]v. 52[/link]). They did not understand the Lord's word rightly. To them it was a hard word ([link]v. 60[/link]). Hence, in this verse the Lord explained that what He would give them to eat was not the meat of His physical body; the meat, which is the flesh, profits nothing. What He would give, eventually, was the Spirit who gives life, who is the Lord Himself in resurrection.</note>
        <note num="3">The Greek word for [i]words,[/i] here and in [link]v. 68[/link], is [i]rhema,[/i] which denotes the instant and present spoken word. It differs from [i]logos[/i] (used for [i]Word[/i] in [link]1:1[/link]), which denotes the constant word. Here [i]the words[/i] follows [i]the Spirit.[/i] The Spirit is living and real, yet He is very mysterious, intangible, and difficult for people to apprehend; the words, however, are substantial. First, the Lord indicated that for giving life He would become the Spirit. Then He said that the words He speaks are spirit and life. This shows that His spoken words are the embodiment of the Spirit of life. He is now the life-giving Spirit in resurrection, and the Spirit is embodied in His words. When we receive His words by exercising our spirit, we get the Spirit, who is life.</note>

        <text>Now the Jews' [note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]Feast of Tabernacles was near.</text>
        <note num="1">In the scene of the case in [link]ch. 6[/link] there was the Feast of the Passover. In the scene of this case in [link]ch. 7[/link] there is the Feast of Tabernacles. The Feast of the Passover is the first of the Jewish annual feasts, and the Feast of Tabernacles is the last ([link]Lev. 23:5[/link], [link]34[/link]). The Feast of the Passover, being the first feast of the year, implies the beginning of man's life (cf. [link]Exo. 12:2-3[/link], [link]6[/link]), which involves man's seeking for satisfaction and results in man's hunger. The Feast of Tabernacles, being the last feast of the year, implies the completion and success of man's life (cf. [link]Exo. 23:16[/link]), which will end and will result in man's thirst. In the scene of the Feast of the Passover, the Lord presented Himself as the bread of life, which satisfies man's hunger. In the scene of the Feast of Tabernacles, the Lord promised that He would flow forth the living water, which quenches man's thirst.[br][br]After the full harvest of their crops, the Jewish people observed the Feast of Tabernacles to worship God and enjoy what they had reaped ([link]Deut. 16:13-15[/link]). Hence, this feast signifies the completion, achievement, and success in man's career, man's study, and other matters of human life, including religion, with the joy and enjoyment thereof.[br][br]God ordained the Feast of Tabernacles so that the children of Israel would remember how their fathers, while wandering in the wilderness, had lived in tents ([link]Lev. 23:39-43[/link]), expecting to enter into the rest of the good land. Hence, this feast is a reminder that today people are still in the wilderness and need to enter into the rest of the New Jerusalem, which is the eternal tabernacle ([link]Rev. 21:2-3[/link]). Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob also lived in tents and looked forward to this eternal tabernacle ([link]Heb. 11:9-10[/link]), in which there will be a river of water of life proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb to quench man's thirst ([link]Rev. 22:1[/link], [link]17[/link]). At the end of such a feast, which had such a background, Christ cried out the promise of the rivers of living water, which will satisfy man's expectation for eternity ([link]vv. 37-39[/link]).</note>

Jesus was glorified when He was resurrected ([link]Luke 24:26[/link]). After Jesus' resurrection, the Spirit of God became the Spirit of the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Jesus Christ, who was breathed into the disciples by Christ in the evening of the day on which He was resurrected ([link]20:22[/link]). The Spirit is now the "another Comforter," the Spirit of reality promised by Christ before His death ([link]14:16-17[/link]). When the Spirit was the Spirit of God, He had only the divine element. After He became the Spirit of Jesus Christ through Christ's incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, the Spirit had both the divine element and the human element, with all the essence and reality of the incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection of Christ. Hence, the Spirit is now the all-inclusive Spirit of Jesus Christ as the living water for us to receive ([link]vv. 38-39[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">In this Gospel nine cases have been selected to prove that the Lord Jesus is the life and the life supply to people. The first six cases, in [link]chs. 3-7[/link], form a group of signs signifying that, on the positive side, the Lord is the life and the life supply to us for regenerating, satisfying, healing, enlivening, feeding, and thirst quenching. The last three cases, in [link]chs. 8-11[/link], form a group of signs signifying that, on the negative side, the Lord is life to us to deliver us from the three main negative things: sin, blindness, and death.[br][br]The case in this chapter reveals all the matters related to the problem of sin: (1) the source of sin &amp;#8212; the devil; (2) the three main items of sin &amp;#8212; adultery and fornication, murder, and lies ([link]vv. 3[/link], [link]41[/link], [link]44[/link]); (3) the bondage, or slavery, of sin; (4) the issue, or result, of sin &amp;#8212; death; (5) the One who is without sin &amp;#8212; the Lord; (6) the One who is qualified to condemn sin &amp;#8212; the Lord; (7) the One who is qualified to forgive sin &amp;#8212; the Lord; (8) the One who is able to set people free from sin &amp;#8212; the Lord. The Lord is the ever-existing God, the great I Am, who became the Son of Man and was lifted up on the cross to bear our sins; hence, He is qualified to forgive our sins. Furthermore, the Lord, being the eternal God, can come into us to be life and light to deliver us from the bondage and darkness of sin.[br][br]The case in this chapter shows also that the religion (represented by the temple &amp;#8212; [link]vv. 2[/link], [link]20[/link]) of law ([link]vv. 5[/link], [link]17[/link]) cannot set people free from sin and death; but the Lord Jesus, the I Am, who became the Son of Man and was lifted up on the cross for the serpent-poisoned people, can do what religion and law cannot do. This chapter shows us that Christ, the great I Am, not only is versus sin and death but also is versus religion and law.</note>

        <note num="1">In Greek the same as [i]reality[/i] in [link]1:14[/link], [link]17[/link]. The truth is not the so-called truth of doctrine but the reality of the divine things, which is the Lord Himself (see note [link]6[sup]2[/sup] in ch. 14[/link]; [link]1:14[/link], [link]17[/link]). This verse says that "the truth shall set you free," whereas [link]v. 36[/link] says that "the Son sets you free." This proves that the Son, the Lord Himself, is the truth. Since the Lord is the embodiment of God ([link]Col. 2:9[/link]), He is the reality of what God is. Hence, reality is the very divine element of God realized by us. When the Lord as the great I Am comes into us as life, He shines within us as light, bringing the divine element as reality into us. This reality, which is the divine element imparted into us and realized by us, sets us free from the bondage of sin by the divine life as the light of man. When the Lord as the Word of God became flesh ([link]1:14[/link]), He brought God to us as this reality, that God might be the grace for our enjoyment ([link]1:17[/link]).</note>

        <note num="2">The Lord's word here revealed that in the devil, the father of lies, there is a particular wicked thing that caused him to become the source of sin. This thing is something of his own, his private possession, and it is something that other creatures do not have.</note>

The divine element of God, working as life and light within man, sets man free from the slavery of sin. But the evil element of the devil, working as sin through death and darkness within man, enslaves man to sin. The devil's nature is a lie and brings in death and darkness. With darkness is falsehood, the opposite of the truth.</note>

        <note num="1">Christ is the door not only for God's elect to enter into the custody of the law, as did Moses, David, Isaiah, and Jeremiah in the Old Testament time, before Christ came, but also for God's chosen people, such as Peter, John, James, and Paul, to come out of the fold of the law now that Christ has come. Thus, the Lord indicated here that He is the door not only through which God's elect may go in but also through which God's chosen people may go out.</note>
        <note num="2">The pasture here signifies Christ as the feeding place for the sheep. When the pasture is not available (e.g., in the wintertime or at night), the sheep must be kept in the fold. When the pasture is ready, there is no further need for the sheep to remain in the fold. To be kept in the fold is transitional and temporary. To be in the pasture enjoying its riches is final and permanent. Before Christ came, the law was a ward, and being under the law was transitional. Now that Christ has come, all God's chosen people must come out of the law and come into Him to enjoy Him as their pasture ([link]Gal. 3:23-25[/link]; [link]4:3-5[/link]). This should be final and permanent. Because they did not have such a revelation, the leaders in Judaism considered the law, on which Judaism was based, as permanent. As a result, they missed Christ and could not participate in Him as their pasture.</note>

        <note num="1">Eternal life (see note [link]15[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 3[/link]) is for the believers' living. The Father's hand, by which He chooses in His love according to His purpose ([link]17:23[/link]; [link]6:38-39[/link]), and the Son's hand, by which He saves by His grace for the fulfillment of the Father's purpose ([link]1:14[/link]; [link]6:37[/link]), both of which have the keeping power, are for the believers' protection. Eternal life will never run out, and the hands of the Father and the Son will never fail. Hence, the believers are eternally secure and will never perish.</note>

        <note num="1">At this point, according to the worldly view, Jesus was in His golden time. A great crowd of the Jews esteemed Him highly and welcomed Him warmly because of the resurrection of Lazarus ([link]vv. 12-19[/link]), and even the Greeks were seeking after Him ([link]vv. 20-22[/link]). But He preferred to fall as a grain of wheat into the ground and die that He might produce many grains for the church.</note>
        <note num="2">This "much fruit" became Christ's increase in resurrection. This increase is the glory into which Christ entered through His death and resurrection ([link]Luke 24:26[/link]). The portion from [link]v. 23[/link] of this chapter to the end of [link]ch. 17[/link] is a discourse on the mystery of this glory. Christ had the glory with God ([link]17:5[/link]). His incarnation caused His divine glory to be concealed in His flesh. Through His death and resurrection His glory was released, producing many grains, which become His increase as the expression of His glory. What was spoken in [link]vv. 23[/link], [link]28[/link]; [link]13:31-32[/link]; [link]14:13[/link]; [link]15:8[/link]; [link]16:14[/link]; and [link]17:1[/link], [link]4[/link], [link]5[/link], [link]10[/link], [link]22[/link], [link]24[/link] is related to this glory. In the Lord's last words to the believers in [link]chs. 14-16[/link], there are three concrete, corporate expressions of this glory: the Father's house (the church) in [link]14:2[/link], the branches of the vine (the constituents of the Body of Christ) in [link]15:1-5[/link], and a newborn corporate man (the new man) in [link]16:21[/link]. All three denote the church, showing that the church is the glorious increase produced by the glorious Christ through His death and resurrection. In this glorious increase, Christ, the Son of God, is glorified, causing God the Father also to be glorified in Christ's glorification, that is, to be fully expressed through the church ([link]Eph. 3:19-21[/link]). This expression needs to be maintained in the oneness of the Triune God. Therefore, the Lord prayed in particular for this matter in His concluding prayer in [link]ch. 17[/link] ([link]17:20-23[/link]). This glorious increase of Christ is the peak of the mystery revealed in the Gospel of John, and its ultimate consummation is the New Jerusalem in Revelation, also written by John. The new holy city will be the aggregate of Christ's increase throughout the generations, and in it Christ's divine glory will be expressed to the uttermost. In the glorifying of God the Son, God the Father also will obtain eternal, matchless glory, which will be His full expression in eternity. Thus His eternal economy will be fulfilled for eternity.</note>

Satan as the old serpent ([link]Rev. 12:9[/link]; [link]20:2[/link]), the ruler of this world, had injected himself into man's flesh. Through His death on the cross in the likeness of the flesh of sin, the Lord destroyed Satan, who is in man's flesh ([link]Heb. 2:14[/link]). By judging Satan ([link]16:11[/link]) in this way, the Lord also judged the world, which is hanging on Satan. Hence, the Lord's being lifted up caused the world to be judged and its ruler, Satan, to be cast out.</note>

        <note num="1">In this Gospel, the first section, [link]chs. 1-13[/link], describes how the Lord as God Himself, as the Son of God, came through His incarnation to bring God into man that He might be man's life for the producing of the church. The second section, [link]chs. 14-21[/link], describes how the Lord as the Son of Man went through His death and resurrection to bring man into God that man and God, God and man, might be built together as a mutual abode. This chapter, coming at the end of the first section, is a dividing line and a turning point.</note>

        <note num="2">In [link]chs. 1-12[/link] life came and brought forth the church, composed of the regenerated ones. In their spirit the regenerated ones are in God and in the heavenlies, but in their body they are still living in the flesh and walking on the earth. Through their contact with earthly things they often become dirty. This frustrates their fellowship with the Lord and with one another. Hence, there is the need for the washing with the Holy Spirit, the word, and life. This is the washing away of their dirtiness that their fellowship with the Lord and with one another may be maintained; it is not the washing away of their sins by the blood ([link]1 John 1:9[/link]). This is why, after [link]ch. 12[/link], there is a need for such a sign in this chapter. Since this Gospel is a book of signs, what is recorded in this chapter should be considered a sign, having spiritual significance. Foot-washing should not be taken merely in a physical sense, but rather in a spiritual sense.</note>
        <note num="3">In ancient times the Jews wore sandals, and since their roads were dusty, their feet easily became dirty. If, when they came to a feast, they sat at the table and stretched out their feet, the dirt and the smell would certainly frustrate the fellowship. Hence, for the feast to be pleasant they needed foot-washing. The Lord washed His disciples' feet to show them that He loved them to the uttermost ([link]v. 1[/link]), and He charged them to do the same to one another in love ([link]vv. 14[/link], [link]34[/link]). Today the world is dirty, and we, the saints, are easily contaminated. For us to maintain pleasant fellowship with the Lord and with one another, we need spiritual foot-washing &amp;#8212; with the washing Holy Spirit, the washing word, and the washing life &amp;#8212; carried out both by the Lord in His love and by one another in love. This is absolutely necessary in order for us to live in the fellowship of the divine life, which is revealed in John's first Epistle, a continuation of the Gospel of John.</note>

        <note num="1">Here the Lord showed His disciples that He is the same as God. The disciples were troubled upon hearing of His leaving. By this word He made them realize that as God He is omnipresent and is not limited by time and space.</note>

        <text>In [note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]My Father's house are [note]2[/note]many [xref]b[/xref]abodes; if [i]it were[/i] not [i]so,[/i] I would have told you; for I [note]3[/note][xref]c[/xref]go to prepare a place for you.</text>
        <note num="1">According to the interpretation in [link]2:16[/link], [link]21[/link], [i]My Father's house[/i] refers to the temple, the body of Christ, as God's dwelling place. At first the body of Christ was only His individual body. But through Christ's death and resurrection, the body of Christ has increased to be His corporate Body, which is the church, including all His believers, who have been regenerated through His resurrection ([link]1 Pet. 1:3[/link]). In Christ's resurrection the church is the Body of Christ, which is the house of God ([link]1 Tim. 3:15[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 2:5[/link]; [link]Heb. 3:6[/link]), God's habitation ([link]Eph. 2:21-22[/link]), God's temple ([link]1 Cor. 3:16-17[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">The many abodes are the many members of the Body of Christ ([link]Rom. 12:5[/link]), which is God's temple ([link]1 Cor. 3:16-17[/link]). This is adequately proven by [link]v. 23[/link], which says that the Lord and the Father will make an abode with the one who loves Him.</note>
        <note num="3">This book has two main sections. The first section, [link]chs. 1-13[/link], points out how Christ, as the eternal Word, came through incarnation to bring God into man that He might be the life and life supply to man. The second section, [link]chs. 14-21[/link], unveils how Christ, as the man Jesus, went through death and resurrection to bring man into God for the building of God's habitation, which is the building of the church ([link]Matt. 16:18[/link]) and which is related to the building of the New Jerusalem ([link]Heb. 11:10[/link]; [link]Rev. 21:2[/link]). In the entire universe God has only one building, that is, the building of His living habitation with His redeemed people.</note>

        <text>And [note]1[/note]if I go and [note]2[/note]prepare a place for you, I [xref]a[/xref]am coming again and will [note]3[/note]receive you to Myself, so that [note]4[/note][xref]b[/xref]where I am you also may be.</text>
        <note num="1">[i]If I go[/i]...I am coming proves that the Lord's going (through His death and resurrection) was His coming (to His disciples &amp;#8212; [link]vv. 18[/link], [link]28[/link]). He came in the flesh ([link]1:14[/link]) and was among His disciples, but He could not enter into them while He was in the flesh. He had to take the further step of passing through death and resurrection in order to be transfigured from the flesh into the Spirit that He might come into the disciples and dwell in them, as revealed in [link]vv. 17-20[/link]. After His resurrection He did come to breathe Himself as the Holy Spirit into the disciples ([link]20:19-22[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">The Lord's intention in this chapter was to bring man into God for the building of His dwelling place. But between man and God there were many obstacles, such as sin, sins, death, the world, the flesh, the self, the old man, and Satan. For the Lord to bring man into God, He had to solve all these problems. Therefore, He had to go to the cross to accomplish redemption that He might open the way and make a standing for man, that man might enter into God. This standing in God, being enlarged, becomes the standing in the Body of Christ. Anyone who does not have a standing, a place, in God does not have a place in the Body of Christ, which is God's dwelling place. Hence, the Lord's going in order to accomplish redemption was to prepare a place in His Body for the disciples.</note>
        <note num="3">In receiving the disciples to Himself, the Lord put them into Himself, as indicated in [link]v. 20[/link] by the words [i]you in Me.[/i]</note>
        <note num="4">The Lord is in the Father ([link]vv. 10-11[/link]). He wanted His disciples also to be in the Father, as revealed in [link]17:21[/link]. Through His death and resurrection He brought His disciples into Himself. Since He is in the Father, they are in the Father by being in Him. Hence, where He is, the disciples are also.</note>

        <note num="1">The way for man to enter into God is the Lord Himself. Since the way is a living person, the place to which the Lord brings man must also be a person, God the Father Himself. The Lord Himself is the living way by which man is brought into God the Father, the living place. The way needs the reality, and the reality needs the life. The Lord Himself is the life to us. This life brings us the reality, and the reality becomes the way by which we enter into the enjoyment of God the Father.</note>
        <note num="2">Christ is the reality of the divine things. This reality came through Him and becomes the realization of God to us. See note [link]14[sup]6[/sup] in ch. 1[/link] and note [link]6[sup]6[/sup] in 1 John 1[/link].</note>

        <note num="1">This chapter unveils the way God dispenses Himself into man. In the dispensing of Himself into us, God is triune. He is one, yet He is three &amp;#8212; the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The Son is the embodiment and expression of the Father ([link]vv. 7-11[/link]), and the Spirit is the reality and realization of the Son ([link]vv. 17-20[/link]). In the Son (the Son is even called the Father &amp;#8212; [link]Isa. 9:6[/link]) the Father is expressed and seen, and as the Spirit ([link]2 Cor. 3:17[/link]) the Son is revealed and realized. The Father in the Son is expressed among the believers, and the Son as the Spirit is realized in the believers. God the Father is hidden, God the Son is manifested among men, and God the Spirit enters into man to be his life, his life supply, and his everything. Hence, this Triune God &amp;#8212; the Father in the Son and the Son as the Spirit &amp;#8212; dispenses Himself into us to be our portion that we may enjoy Him as our everything in His divine trinity.</note>

        <note num="1">To be in the Lord's name, here and in [link]v. 14[/link], means to be one with the Lord, to live by the Lord, and to let the Lord live in us. The Lord came and did things in the Father's name ([link]5:43[/link]; [link]10:25[/link]), meaning that He was one with the Father ([link]10:30[/link]), that He lived because of the Father ([link]6:57[/link]), and that the Father worked in Him ([link]v. 10[/link]). In the Gospels the Lord as the expression of the Father did things in the Father's name. In the Acts the disciples as the expression of the Lord did even greater things ([link]v. 12[/link]) in the Lord's name.</note>
        <note num="2">For the Father to be glorified in the Son means that His divine element is expressed from within the Son. Whatever the Son does expresses the Father's divine element. This is the glorifying of the Father in the Son.</note>

        <note num="1">The Spirit promised here was referred to in [link]7:39[/link]. This Spirit is the Spirit of life ([link]Rom. 8:2[/link]), and this promise of the Lord's was fulfilled on the day of the Lord's resurrection, when the Spirit as the breath of life was breathed into the disciples ([link]20:22[/link]). The Lord's promise here is different from the promise of the Father concerning the Spirit of power in [link]Luke 24:49[/link]. That promise was fulfilled fifty days after the Lord's resurrection, on the day of Pentecost, when the Spirit as the mighty wind blew upon the disciples ([link]Acts 2:1-4[/link]). In this verse the Spirit of life is called "the Spirit of reality." This Spirit of reality is Christ ([link]v. 6[/link]); hence, the Spirit of reality is the Spirit of Christ ([link]Rom. 8:9[/link]). This Spirit is also the reality of Christ ([link]1 John 5:6[/link], [link]20[/link]) that Christ may be realized in those who believe into Him, as their life and life supply.</note>
        <note num="2">The very "He" who is the Spirit of reality in this verse becomes the very "I" who is the Lord Himself in [link]v. 18[/link]. This means that the Christ who was in the flesh went through death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit, the pneumatic Christ. [link]First Corinthians 15:45[/link] confirms this. In dealing with the matter of resurrection, that verse says, "The last Adam [Christ in the flesh] became a life-giving Spirit."</note>
        <note num="3">This is the first time that the promise of the Spirit's indwelling is revealed. It is fulfilled and fully developed in the Epistles. See [link]1 Cor. 6:19[/link] and [link]Rom. 8:9[/link], [link]11[/link].</note>

        <note num="1">The Comforter, the Holy Spirit, was to be sent by the Father in the Son's name. Therefore, the Holy Spirit was sent by the Father and also by the Son. Thus, the Holy Spirit comes not only from the Father but also from the Son, and He is the reality not only of the Father but also of the Son. Hence, when we call on the name of the Son, we get the Spirit ([link]1 Cor. 12:3[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">The Father being in the Son's name is equivalent to the Father being the Son (see note [link]43[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 5[/link]). Therefore, the Father's sending of the Holy Spirit in the Son's name is the Son's sending of the Holy Spirit from the Father ([link]15:26[/link]). The Son and the Father are one ([link]10:30[/link]). Hence, the Spirit who is sent comes not only out of the Father ([link]15:26[/link]) but also out of the Son. Moreover, when the Spirit comes, He comes with the Father and the Son (see note [link]26[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 15[/link]). This proves that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one God, the Triune God, who reaches us and is working, that is, dispensing, Himself into us in His divine trinity to be our life and everything.</note>
        <note num="3">In [link]5:43[/link] we are told that the Son came in the Father's name, and here that the Father sent the Holy Spirit in the Son's name. This proves not only that the Son and the Father are one ([link]10:30[/link]) but also that the Holy Spirit is one with the Father and the Son. The Holy Spirit, who is sent by the Father in the Son's name, is not only the reality that comes from the Father but also the reality that comes from the Son. This is the Triune God &amp;#8212; the Father, the Son, and the Spirit &amp;#8212; who reaches man eventually as the Spirit.</note>

        <note num="2">The Greek word means [i]cultivator of the soil, land-worker, farmer[/i] ([link]2 Tim. 2:6[/link]; [link]James 5:7[/link]; [link]Matt. 21:33[/link]). The Father as the husbandman is the source, the author, the planner, the planter, the life, the substance, the soil, the water, the air, the sunshine, and everything to the vine. The Son as the vine is the center of God's economy and the embodiment of all the riches of the Father. The Father, by cultivating the Son, works Himself with all His riches into the vine, and eventually the vine expresses the Father in a corporate way through its branches. This is the Father's economy in the universe.</note>

        <note num="1">We were wild branches, and through faith we have been grafted into Christ. Here the Lord said that He [i]set[/i] us. This fits the thought of grafting.</note>
        <note num="2">The Greek word for [i]go forth[/i] means [i]to depart,[/i] implying to leave for another place; hence, it is rendered [i]go forth.[/i] It is the same Greek word as that for [i]go[/i] in [link]14:4[/link] and [link]16:5[/link]. The fruit borne by going forth in this way does not denote the virtues of the fruit-bearer's character, such as the fruit of the Holy Spirit in the believer's living, mentioned in [link]Gal. 5:22-23[/link], but it denotes the believers produced by the fruit-bearer. This corresponds with the subject of this section, [link book="John"]12:20-17:26[/link], which is Christ's multiplication. The virtues we possess through our abiding in the Lord cannot be counted as Christ's multiplication. Only the believers that we produce in the Lord are the tangible multiplication of Christ. The Father's house in [link]ch. 14[/link], the true vine in this chapter, and the man-child in [link]ch. 16[/link] are all related to the multiplication of Christ.</note>
        <note num="3">After we go forth to produce believers in the Lord, we need to care for them. The best way is to set up meetings in their homes to cover and protect them that they may be cared for by being nourished and taught, and may become the remaining fruit, living in the branches of the true vine, that is, in the Body of Christ, to be Christ's increase.</note>

In Adam we were born of sin. The only way to be freed from sin is to believe into Christ, the Son of God ([link]v. 9[/link]). If we believe into Him, He is righteousness to us, and we are justified in Him ([link]Rom. 3:24[/link]; [link]4:25[/link]). If we do not repent of the sin that is in Adam and believe into Christ, the Son of God, we will remain in sin and share the judgment of Satan for eternity ([link]Matt. 25:41[/link]).

        <text>But when He, the [xref]a[/xref]Spirit of reality, comes, He will [note]1[/note]guide you into all the [xref]b[/xref]reality; for He will not speak [xref]c[/xref]from Himself, but what He hears He will speak; and He will [note]1[/note]declare to you [xref]d[/xref]the things that are coming.</text>
        <note num="1">The work of the Spirit is, first, to convict the world. Second, as the Spirit of reality He guides the believers into all the reality; that is, He makes all that the Son is and has real to the believers. All that the Father is and has is embodied in the Son ([link]Col. 2:9[/link]), and all that the Son is and has is declared as reality to the believers through the Spirit ([link]vv. 14-15[/link]). This declaring is the glorifying of the Son with the Father. Hence, it is a matter of the Triune God being wrought into and mingled with the believers. Third, the Spirit declares the things that are to come, which are revealed mainly in Revelation ([link]Rev. 1:1[/link], [link]19[/link]). The three aspects of the Spirit's work correspond with the three sections of John's writings: his Gospel, his Epistles, and his Revelation.</note>

        <note num="1">This is the subject of the Lord's prayer in this chapter. He was God incarnated in the flesh, and His flesh was a tabernacle in which God could dwell on earth ([link]1:14[/link]). His divine element was confined in His humanity, just as God's shekinah glory had been concealed within the tabernacle. Once, on the mountain of transfiguration, His divine element was released from within His flesh and expressed in glory, being seen by the three disciples ([link]Matt. 17:1-4[/link]; [link]John 1:14[/link]). But then it was concealed again in His flesh. Before this prayer He predicted that He would be glorified and that the Father would be glorified in Him ([link]12:23[/link]; [link]13:31-32[/link]). Now He was about to pass through death so that the concealing shell of His humanity might be broken and His divine element, His divine life, might be released. Also, He would resurrect that He might uplift His humanity into the divine element and that His divine element might be expressed, with the result that His entire being, His divinity and His humanity, would be glorified (see note [link]23[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 12[/link]). The Father would thus be glorified in Him (see note [link]28[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 12[/link]). Hence, He prayed for this.[br][br]The Lord's prayer here concerning the divine mystery is fulfilled in three stages. First, it was fulfilled in His resurrection, in that His divine element, His divine life, was released from within His humanity into His many believers ([link]12:23-24[/link]), and His whole being, including His humanity, was brought into glory ([link]Luke 24:26[/link]), and in that the Father's divine element was expressed in His resurrection and glorification. In His resurrection God answered and fulfilled His prayer ([link]Acts 3:13-15[/link]). Second, it has been fulfilled in the church, in that as His resurrection life has been expressed through His many members, He has been glorified in them, and the Father has been glorified in Him through the church ([link]Eph. 3:21[/link]; [link]1 Tim. 3:15-16[/link]). Third, it will ultimately be fulfilled in the New Jerusalem, in that He will be fully expressed in glory, and God will be glorified in Him through the holy city for eternity ([link]Rev. 21:11[/link], [link]23-24[/link]).[br][br]In praying in this way, the Lord unveiled His person, His deity; He is the same as the Father in the divine glory.</note>

        <note num="1">To be sanctified ([link]Eph. 5:26[/link]; [link]1 Thes. 5:23[/link]) is to be separated from the world and its usurpation unto God and His purpose, not only positionally ([link]Matt. 23:17[/link], [link]19[/link]) but also dispositionally ([link]Rom. 6:19[/link], [link]22[/link]). God's living word works in the believers to separate them from anything worldly. This is to be sanctified in God's word, which is the truth, the reality.</note>
        <note num="2">Or, in the reality. Reality is the Triune God ([link]1:14[/link], [link]17[/link]; [link]14:6[/link]; [link]1 John 5:6[/link]).

We are sanctified in the reality of this word.</note>
        <note num="3">The Father's word carries the reality of the Father with it. When God's word says, "God is light," it carries God as light in it. Hence, God's word is reality, the truth, unlike Satan's word, which is vanity, a lie ([link]8:44[/link]).</note>

        <note num="2">This is the third aspect of the believers' oneness, the oneness in the divine glory for the corporate expression of God. In this aspect of oneness the believers, their self having been fully denied, enjoy the glory of the Father as the factor of their perfected oneness and thus express God in a corporate, built-up way. This is the oneness of the divine commission; it fulfills the Son's prayer that He be fully expressed, that is, glorified, in the building up of the believers, and that the Father be fully expressed, glorified, in the Son's glorification. Hence, the ultimate oneness of the believers is (1) in the eternal life of God (in the Father's name), (2) by the holy word of God, and (3) in the divine glory to express the Triune God for eternity. That the Son might accomplish this oneness, the Father gave Him six things: the authority ([link]v. 2[/link]), the believers ([link]vv. 2[/link], [link]6[/link], [link]9[/link], [link]24[/link]), the work ([link]v. 4[/link]), the words ([link]v. 8[/link]), the Father's name ([link]vv. 11-12[/link]), and the Father's glory ([link]v. 24[/link]). That the believers may participate in this oneness, the Son gave them three things: the eternal life ([link]v. 2[/link]), the holy word of God ([link]vv. 8[/link], [link]14[/link]), and the divine glory ([link]v. 22[/link]).

The dreadful environment of death did not frighten Him in the least; rather, it provided a contrast that proved strongly that He, as life, was versus death and could not be affected by death in any way.

        <text>But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately there came out [note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]blood and [note]1[/note][xref]b[/xref]water.</text>
        <note num="1">Two substances came out of the Lord's pierced side: blood and water. Blood is for redemption, to deal with sins ([link]1:29[/link]; [link]Heb. 9:22[/link]) for the purchasing of the church ([link]Acts 20:28[/link]). Water is for imparting life, to deal with death ([link]12:24[/link]; [link]3:14-15[/link]) for the producing of the church ([link]Eph. 5:29-30[/link]). The Lord's death, on the negative side, takes away our sins, and on the positive side, imparts life into us. Hence, it has two aspects: the redemptive aspect and the life-imparting aspect. The redemptive aspect is for the life-imparting aspect. The record of the other three Gospels portrays only the redemptive aspect of the Lord's death; John's record portrays not only the redemptive aspect but also the life-imparting aspect. In [link]Matt. 27:45[/link], [link]51[/link], [link]Mark 15:33[/link], and [link]Luke 23:44-45[/link], darkness, a symbol of sin, appeared, and the veil of the temple, which separated man from God, was rent. These signs are related to the redemptive aspect of the Lord's death. The words spoken by the Lord on the cross in [link]Luke 23:34[/link], "Father, forgive them," and in [link]Matt. 27:46[/link], "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" (because He bore our sin at that time), also depict the redemptive aspect of His death. But the flowing water and the unbroken bone mentioned by John in [link]vv. 34[/link] and [link]36[/link] are signs that relate to the life-imparting aspect of the Lord's death (see note [link]26[sup]1[/sup][/link]). This death that imparts life released the Lord's divine life from within Him for the producing of the church, which is composed of all His believers, into whom His divine life has been imparted. This life-imparting death of the Lord's is typified by Adam's sleep, out from which Eve was produced ([link]Gen. 2:21-23[/link]), and is signified by the death of the one grain of wheat that fell into the ground for the bringing forth of many grains ([link]12:24[/link]) to make the one bread &amp;#8212; the Body of Christ ([link]1 Cor. 10:17[/link]). Hence, it is also the life-propagating, life-multiplying death, the generating and reproducing death.[br][br]The Lord's pierced side was prefigured by Adam's opened side, out from which Eve was produced ([link]Gen. 2:21-23[/link]). The blood was typified by the blood of the passover lamb ([link]Exo. 12:7[/link], [link]22[/link]; [link]Rev. 12:11[/link]), and the water was typified by the water that flowed out of the smitten rock ([link]Exo. 17:6[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 10:4[/link]). The blood formed a fountain for the washing away of sin ([link]Zech. 13:1[/link]), and the water became the fountain of life ([link]Psa. 36:9[/link]; [link]Rev. 21:6[/link]).</note>

        <note num="2">In the Scripture the first mention of a bone is in [link]Gen. 2:21-23[/link]; there it was a rib taken out of Adam for the producing and building of Eve as a match for Adam. Eve was a type of the church, which is produced and built with the Lord's resurrection life released out of Him. Hence, the bone is a symbol, a figure, of the Lord's resurrection life, which nothing can break. The Lord's side was pierced, but not one of His bones was broken. This signifies that although the Lord's physical life was terminated, His resurrection life, the very divine life, could not be hurt or damaged by anything. This is the life with which the church is produced and built; it is also the eternal life, which we have obtained by believing into Him ([link]3:36[/link]).</note>

        <text>[xref]a[/xref]Now on the [note]1[/note][xref]b[/xref]first [xref]c[/xref]day of the week, Mary the Magdalene [note]2[/note]came early to the tomb while it was yet dark and saw the stone taken away from the tomb.</text>
        <note num="1">The first day of the week, or the day after the Sabbath, signifies a new beginning, a new age. In [link]Lev. 23:10-11[/link], [link]15[/link], a sheaf of the firstfruits of the harvest was offered to the Lord as a wave offering on the day after the Sabbath. That sheaf of the firstfruits was a type of Christ as the firstfruits in resurrection ([link]1 Cor. 15:20[/link], [link]23[/link]). Christ resurrected on precisely the day after the Sabbath. By His all-inclusive death He terminated the old creation, which had been completed in six days, after which was the Sabbath day. In His resurrection He germinated the new creation with the divine life. Hence, the day of His resurrection was the beginning of a new week &amp;#8212; a new age. This day of His resurrection was appointed by God ([link]Psa. 118:24[/link]), was prophesied as "today" in [link]Psa. 2:7[/link], was predicted by Himself as the third day ([link]Matt. 16:21[/link]; [link]John 2:19[/link], [link]22[/link]), and later was called by the early Christians "the Lord's Day" ([link]Rev. 1:10[/link]). On this day Christ was born in resurrection as the firstborn Son of God ([link]Acts 13:33[/link]; [link]Heb. 1:5[/link]) and the Firstborn from the dead to be the Head of the Body, the church ([link]Col. 1:18[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">The Lord's resurrection had been accomplished, but the discovery of it required the disciples' seeking in love toward the Lord. It was thus that Mary the Magdalene discovered it and obtained the fresh manifestation of the Lord and the revelation of the issue of His resurrection: that His Father is the Father of those who believe into Him, and that those who believe into Him are His brothers ([link]v. 17[/link]; see notes [link]17[sup]2[/sup][/link] and [link]17[sup]3[/sup][/link]). Peter and John only knew of the discovery; Mary obtained the experience. The brothers were satisfied with having faith in the fact of the Lord's resurrection, but the sister went further and sought the resurrected Lord Himself, i.e., the personal experience of the Lord. The Lord was there all the time, but He was not manifested until [link]v. 16[/link].</note>

These things had been offered to the Lord and wrapped around Him by His two disciples, Joseph and Nicodemus ([link]19:38-42[/link]).

        <note num="1">On the day of His resurrection the Lord ascended to the Father. This was a secret ascension, the ultimate fulfillment of the going predicted in [link]16:7[/link]. It occurred forty days prior to His public ascension, which took place before the eyes of the disciples ([link]Acts 1:9-11[/link]). On the day of resurrection, early in the morning He ascended to satisfy the Father, and late in the evening He returned to the disciples ([link]v. 19[/link]). The freshness of His resurrection must be first for the Father's enjoyment, as in the type the firstfruits of the harvest were brought first to God.</note>
        <note num="2">Previously, the most intimate term the Lord had used in reference to His disciples was "friends" ([link]15:14-15[/link]). But after His resurrection He began to call them "brothers," for through His resurrection His disciples were regenerated ([link]1 Pet. 1:3[/link]) with the divine life, which had been released by His life-imparting death, as indicated in [link]12:24[/link]. He was the one grain of wheat that fell into the ground and died and grew up to bring forth many grains for the producing of the one bread, which is His Body ([link]1 Cor. 10:17[/link]). He was the Father's only Son, the Father's individual expression. Through His death and resurrection the Father's only begotten became the Firstborn among many brothers ([link]Rom. 8:29[/link]). His many brothers are the many sons of God and are the church ([link]Heb. 2:10-12[/link]), a corporate expression of God the Father in the Son. This is God's ultimate intention. The many brothers are the propagation of the Father's life and the multiplication of the Son in the divine life. Hence, in the Lord's resurrection God's eternal purpose is fulfilled.</note>
        <note num="3">Through His life-imparting death and resurrection, the Lord made His disciples one with Him. Therefore, His Father is the Father of His disciples, and His God is the God of His disciples. In His resurrection they have the Father's life and God's divine nature, just as He has. In making them His brothers, He has imparted the Father's life and God's divine nature into them. By making His Father and His God theirs, He has brought them into His position &amp;#8212; the position of the Son &amp;#8212; before the Father and God. Thus, in life and nature inwardly and in position outwardly they are the same as the Lord, with whom they have been united.</note>

Hence, the Lord's breathing of the Holy Spirit into the disciples was the fulfillment of His promise of the Holy Spirit as the Comforter. This fulfillment differs from the one in [link]Acts 2:1-4[/link], which was the fulfillment of the Father's promise in [link]Luke 24:49[/link]. (See note [link]17[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 14[/link].) In [link]Acts 2[/link] the Spirit as a rushing, violent wind came as power upon the disciples for their work ([link]Acts 1:8[/link]). Here the Spirit as breath was breathed as life into the disciples for their life. By breathing the Spirit into the disciples, the Lord imparted Himself into them as life and everything. Thus, all that He had spoken in [link]chs. 14-16[/link] could be fulfilled.[br][br]As falling into the ground to die and growing out of the ground transform the grain of wheat into another form, one that is new and living, so the death and resurrection of the Lord transfigured Him from the flesh into the Spirit. As the last Adam in the flesh, through the process of death and resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit ([link]1 Cor. 15:45[/link]). As He is the embodiment of the Father, so the Spirit is the realization, the reality, of Him. It is as the Spirit that He was breathed into the disciples. It is as the Spirit that He is received into His believers and flows out of them as rivers of living water ([link]7:38-39[/link]). It is as the Spirit that through His death and resurrection He came back to the disciples, entered into them as their Comforter, and began to abide in them ([link]14:16-17[/link]). It is as the Spirit that He can live in the disciples and enable them to live by and with Him ([link]14:19[/link]). It is as the Spirit that He can abide in the disciples and enable them to abide in Him ([link]14:20[/link]; [link]15:4-5[/link]). It is as the Spirit that He can come with the Father to His lover and make an abode with him ([link]14:23[/link]). It is as the Spirit that He can cause all that He is and has to be fully realized by the disciples ([link]16:13-16[/link]). It is as the Spirit that He came to meet with His brothers as the church to declare the Father's name to them and to praise the Father in their midst ([link]Heb. 2:11-12[/link]). It is as the Spirit that He can send His disciples for His commission, with Himself as life and everything to them, in the same way that the Father sent Him ([link]v. 21[/link]). They are thus qualified to represent Him with His authority in the fellowship of His Body ([link]v. 23[/link]) for the carrying out of His commission.[br][br]The Lord was the Word, and the Word is the eternal God ([link]1:1[/link]). For the accomplishing of God's eternal purpose, He took two steps. First, He took the step of incarnation to become a man in the flesh ([link]1:14[/link]), to be the Lamb of God to accomplish redemption for man ([link]1:29[/link]), to declare God to man ([link]1:18[/link]), and to manifest the Father to His believers ([link]14:9-11[/link]). Second, He took the step of death and resurrection to be transfigured into the Spirit that He might impart Himself into His believers as their life and their everything, and that He might bring forth many sons of God, His many brothers, for the building of His Body, the church, the habitation of God, to express the Triune God for eternity. Hence, originally He was the eternal Word; then, through His incarnation He became flesh to accomplish God's redemption, and through His death and resurrection He became the Spirit to be everything and do everything for the completion of God's building.[br][br]This Gospel testifies that the Lord is (1) God ([link]1:1-2[/link]; [link]5:17-18[/link]; [link]10:30-33[/link]; [link]14:9-11[/link]; [link]20:28[/link]), (2) the life ([link]1:4[/link]; [link]10:10[/link]; [link]11:25[/link]; [link]14:6[/link]), and (3) the resurrection ([link]11:25[/link]). Chapters 1-17 prove that He is God among men. Men are in contrast to Him as God. Chapters 18-19 prove that He is life in the environment of death. Death, or the environment of death, is in contrast to Him as life. Chapters 20-21 prove that He is the resurrection in the midst of the old creation, the natural life. The old creation, the natural life, is in contrast to Him as the resurrection, of which the Spirit is the reality. As the resurrection, He can be realized only in the Spirit. Hence, eventually He is the Spirit in resurrection. He is God among men ([link]chs. 1-17[/link]), He is life in death ([link]chs. 18-19[/link]), and He is the Spirit in resurrection ([link]chs. 20-21[/link]).</note>

Thomas missed the first meeting that the Lord held with His disciples after His resurrection, and he missed all the blessings as well.

Before His death the Lord was in the flesh, and His presence was visible. After His resurrection the Lord became the Spirit, and His presence was invisible. His manifestations, or appearings, after His resurrection were to train the disciples to realize, to enjoy, and to practice His invisible presence, which is more available, prevailing, precious, rich, and real than His visible presence. In His resurrection this dear presence of His was just the Spirit, whom He had breathed into them and who would be with them all the time.</note>

        <note num="1">By the end of [link]ch. 20[/link] the Lord had come back as the Spirit, as the pneumatic Christ, to be with the disciples as everything to them. Therefore, this Gospel might be considered closed there ([link]20:30-31[/link]). But how could the disciples make a living? What should they do to carry out His commission? How should they follow Him after His resurrection? What would be their future? This additional chapter is needed that these problems might be dealt with.</note>
        <note num="2">This proves that His coming to the disciples in [link]20:26[/link] was actually a manifestation, for here it is said that He manifested Himself again to the disciples.

Whether or not they were conscious of His presence, He was with them all the time. Because of their weakness He sometimes manifested His presence in order to strengthen their faith in Him.</note>

The Lord allowed Peter to fail utterly in denying the Lord to His face three times ([link]18:17[/link], [link]25[/link], [link]27[/link]), so that his natural strength and his self-confidence could be dealt with. Furthermore, Peter had just taken the lead to backslide from the Lord's call. His natural confidence in his love toward the Lord also must have been dealt with by this failure; yet he might have been somewhat disappointed. The Lord therefore came to restore his love toward Him, to charge him with the shepherding of His church, and to prepare him for his martyrdom so that he would not follow Him with any confidence in his natural strength.</note>

The Lord came as life and the life supply to us. We need to have faith in Him and love toward Him. This Gospel presents these as the two requirements for us to participate in the Lord.</note>

Between these two events are all the matters related to the Christian life during the church age: seeking the Lord with love toward Him; seeing the Lord in resurrection; receiving the revelation of the issue of the Lord's resurrection &amp;#8212; that His Father is our Father and we are His brothers &amp;#8212; by experiencing His manifestation; meeting with the believers to enjoy the Lord's presence; having the Lord breathe the Holy Spirit into us, and being sent by the Lord with His commission and authority to represent Him; learning how to live by faith in the Lord and trust in Him for our daily living; loving the Lord, the natural strength having been dealt with; shepherding the flock for the building of the church; practicing the Lord's invisible presence, with some following the Lord even unto death to glorify God, not by self-will but according to His leading, and some living until He comes back.</note>

        <note num="1">This verse, together with [link]20:30-31[/link], affirms that this Gospel is the record of selected things that serve the purpose of testifying to the matter of life and building.[br][br]In note [link]20[sup]2[/sup][/link], par. 2, in [link]Matt. 28[/link] it is pointed out that the Lord's ascension is not mentioned in John or Matthew. The reason it is not mentioned is that today, after His resurrection, the Lord is still on the earth to be with His believers, and He will be with them until the end of this age, when He will be manifested in His visible glory ([link]1 Pet. 1:7[/link]; [link]2 Thes. 1:7[/link]), that is, when He will come back to the earth in His visible presence ([link]Matt. 16:27[/link]) to establish His visible kingdom. The Gospel of Matthew unveils and testifies that today, after His resurrection, the Lord, who is the spiritual King of the invisible kingdom of the heavens, is still on the earth in His Spirit of resurrection to be with the people of the kingdom of the heavens in His invisible presence; hence, Matthew does not mention His leaving the earth to ascend to the heavens. The Gospel of John reveals and testifies that as the Triune God, the Lord became flesh ([link]1:14[/link]) to be the Lamb of God ([link]1:29[/link]) and, after accomplishing His redemptive death for man, was transfigured in resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit ([link]1 Cor. 15:45[/link]) and to enter into those who believe into Him to be their life for eternity, never to be separated from them; hence, it would have been inappropriate for John to mention His going away in ascension.[br][br]Furthermore, the four Gospels are a full revelation of how the Triune God came to complete Christ, that is, to make Christ complete. The record in the Gospel of John is crucial regarding this matter. It shows us that the completing of Christ, who was anointed and commissioned by God to accomplish God's eternal will, was carried out by the Triune God becoming flesh in order to be united with man. First, through His death in the flesh He accomplished redemption for man, and then through resurrection He was transfigured to become the Spirit that He might enter into the believers ([link]20:22[/link]) to be united with them, that they might be united with the Triune God ([link]17:21[/link]). Thus He became Christ, the embodiment of God, and is able to take away men's sins and enter into men to be their life that they may become the sons of God to be His members, constituting His Body as the full expression of the Triune God. Thus, He is in them to be all their reality and to be with them invisibly until their bodies are redeemed and transfigured that they may enter into His visible presence to be completely united with Him and completely like Him, and to become the New Jerusalem, which is about to be completed, as the mutual habitation of the Triune God and His redeemed people for eternity!</note>
