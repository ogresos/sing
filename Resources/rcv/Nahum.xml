        <note num="1">See note [link]2[sup]1[/sup] in Jonah 1[/link]. The prophecies of both Jonah and Nahum relate to the city of Nineveh. Whereas Jonah brought, or extended, God's salvation to that sinful city, Nahum brought God's judgment upon it. Jonah reveals that God in His salvation is the God of all the peoples of the earth, not only of the Jews but also of the Gentiles (see note [link]11[sup]1[/sup] in Jonah 4[/link]). Nahum reveals that God is also the God of all peoples in His judgment. Thus, God is the God of all peoples both in judgment and in salvation.[br/][br/]Although He extended His salvation to Nineveh, God judged Nineveh because Nineveh was sinful and invaded Israel ([link]2 Kings 15:19-20[/link], [link]29[/link]; [link]17:3-6[/link]; [link]18:9-19:37[/link]). Assyria was the first nation to devastate Israel, invading Israel more than one hundred years before the Babylonian invasion under Nebuchadnezzar ([link]2 Kings 24:1-25:21[/link]).</note>

The Assyrian locusts were eventually defeated by the Babylonian locusts.[br/][br/]According to the Minor Prophets, God's chastising of Israel and His punishing of the nations are for the manifestation of Christ. The main point of Nahum is that while God was chastising Israel and punishing the nations, He always did what was necessary to preserve Israel for the purpose of manifesting Christ. God used one kind of locust to deal with another kind of locust in order to preserve Israel that Christ might have a channel &amp;#8212; the reserved and preserved Israel &amp;#8212; through which to be brought forth.</note>
