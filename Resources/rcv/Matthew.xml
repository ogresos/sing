        <note num="1">The first name and the last name ([link]Rev. 22:21[/link]) in the New Testament is Jesus, proving that Jesus Christ is the subject and content of the New Testament.[br][br]The Bible is a book of life, and this life is a living person, the wonderful and all-inclusive Christ. The Old Testament gives a portrait, in types and prophecies, of this wonderful person as the Coming One. Now, in the New Testament, this wonderful person has come. The first page of the New Testament, in recommending this wonderful person to us, gives us His genealogy. This genealogy can be considered an abstract of the Old Testament, which in itself is the detailed genealogy of Christ. To understand the genealogy in Matthew, we need to trace the origin and history of every incident.[br][br]Christ, as the wonderful center of the entire Bible, is all-inclusive, having many aspects. The New Testament at its beginning presents four biographies to portray the four main aspects of this all-inclusive Christ. The Gospel of Matthew testifies that He is the King, the Christ of God prophesied in the Old Testament, who brings the kingdom of the heavens to the earth. The Gospel of Mark tells us that He is the Servant of God, laboring for God faithfully. Mark's account is most simple, for a servant does not warrant a detailed record. The Gospel of Luke presents a full picture of Him as the only proper and normal man who ever lived on this earth; as such a man, He is the Savior of mankind. The Gospel of John unveils Him as the Son of God, the very God Himself, who is life to God's people. Among the four Gospels, Matthew and Luke have a record of genealogy; Mark and John do not. To testify that Jesus is the King, the Christ of God prophesied in the Old Testament, Matthew needs to show us the antecedents and status of this King, to prove that He is the proper successor to the throne of David. To prove that Jesus is a proper and normal man, Luke needs to show the generations of this man, to attest that He is qualified to be the Savior of mankind. For the record of a servant, Mark does not need to tell us His origin. To unveil that Jesus is the very God, neither does John need to give us His human genealogy; rather, he declares that, as the Word of God, He is the very God in the beginning.[br][br]The kingdom, of which Christ is the King, is composed of Abraham's descendants, including both his descendants in the flesh and those in faith. Hence, the genealogy of Christ in Matthew begins with Abraham, the father of the called race, not with Adam, the father of the created race. God's kingdom is not built with the created race of Adam but with the called race of Abraham, which includes both the real Israelites ([link]Rom. 9:6-8[/link]) and the believers in Christ ([link]Gal. 3:7[/link], [link]9[/link], [link]29[/link]). To prove by relating His genealogy that Jesus is a proper man qualified to be the Savior of mankind, Luke traces His genealogy back to Adam, the first generation of mankind.</note>
        <note num="2">In the genealogy of Jesus given by Luke, which proves that He is a proper man, the title [i]Christ[/i] is not mentioned ([link]Luke 3:23-38[/link]). But in the genealogy of Christ given here by Matthew, which proves that He is the King, the Christ of God, the title [i]Christ[/i] is emphasized repeatedly ([link]vv. 1[/link], [link]16-17[/link]).</note>
        <note num="3">Solomon is a type of Christ as the son of David, the One who inherits the throne and kingdom of David ([link]2 Sam. 7:12-13[/link]; [link]Luke 1:32-33[/link]). Solomon, as a type of Christ, did mainly two things: he built the temple of God in the kingdom ([link]1 Kings 6:2[/link]) and spoke the word of wisdom ([link]1 Kings 10:23-24[/link]; [link]Matt. 12:42[/link]). Christ, in fulfilling this type, is now building the real temple of God, the church, in the kingdom of God and has spoken the word of wisdom.</note>
        <note num="4">Isaac is a type of Christ as the son of Abraham, the One who inherits the promise and blessing God gave to Abraham ([link]Gen. 22:17-18[/link]; [link]Gal. 3:16[/link], [link]14[/link]). Isaac also, as a type of Christ, did mainly two things: he obeyed his father even unto death and was resurrected from death ([link]Gen. 22:9-10[/link]; [link]Heb. 11:19[/link]), and he took Rebekah, a Gentile woman, as his wife ([link]Gen. 24:61-67[/link]). Christ, in fulfilling this type, was put to death and offered to God and was resurrected from death, and He is taking the church as His bride out of the Gentiles.</note>

        <note num="3">The birthright of the promised seed consists of the double portion of the land, the priesthood, and the kingship. Reuben, as the firstborn son of Jacob, should have inherited the birthright. But because of his defilement he lost the birthright ([link]Gen. 49:3-4[/link]; [link]1 Chron. 5:1-2[/link]). The double portion of the land went to Joseph through his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim ([link]Josh. 16-17[/link]); the priesthood went to Levi ([link]Deut. 33:8-10[/link]); and the kingship was given to Judah ([link]Gen. 49:10[/link]; [link]1 Chron. 5:2[/link]).

Regardless of our background, if we turn to God and His people and are joined to the proper person among God's people, we will bring forth proper fruit and participate in the enjoyment of the birthright of Christ.</note>
        <note num="2">Boaz redeemed his kinsman's inheritance and married the man's widow ([link]Ruth 4:1-17[/link]). By so doing he became a notable forefather of Christ, a great associate of Christ.</note>
        <note num="3">The origin of Ruth was incest, for she belonged to the tribe of Moab ([link]Ruth 1:4[/link]), the fruit of Lot's incestuous union with his daughter ([link]Gen. 19:30-38[/link]). [link]Deuteronomy 23:3[/link] forbade the Moabites to enter the assembly of Jehovah, even to the tenth generation. Ruth, however, not only was accepted by the Lord but also became one of the most important ancestors of Christ because she sought God and God's people ([link]Ruth 1:15-17[/link]; [link]2:11-12[/link]). Regardless of who we are and what our background is, as long as we have a heart that seeks God and His people, we are in a position to be accepted into the birthright of Christ.[br][br]Boaz's mother, Rahab, was a Canaanitess and a prostitute, and his wife, Ruth, was a Moabitess of incestuous origin and a widow. Both were Gentiles and of low class, yet they are associated with Christ. Christ is joined not only to the Jews but also to the Gentiles, even to those of low estate.</note>

        <note num="1">David was the eighth son of his father and was chosen and anointed by God ([link]1 Sam. 16:10-13[/link]). The number eight signifies resurrection. That David as the eighth son was chosen by God indicates that his association with Christ was in resurrection. Furthermore, he was a man after the heart of God ([link]1 Sam. 13:14[/link]) and brought in God's kingdom for Christ.[br][br]David was the last of the generations of the fathers. He was also the first of the generations of the kings. He was the conclusion of one age and the beginning of the next. He became the landmark of two ages because he brought in the kingdom of God and was closely associated with Christ.</note>
        <note num="2">In this genealogy, only David is called "the king" because it was through him that the kingdom with the kingship was brought in.</note>
        <note num="3">When David committed murder and adultery, he was rebuked by the prophet Nathan, whom God had sent purposely to condemn him ([link]2 Sam. 12:1-12[/link]). When David was condemned, he repented. Psalm 51 is the record of his repentance. He repented and God forgave him ([link]2 Sam. 12:13[/link]). Then he begot Solomon ([link]2 Sam. 12:24[/link]). Hence, Solomon is the issue of man's transgression and repentance plus God's forgiveness.[br][br]The genealogy in Matthew says that David begot Solomon, but the genealogy in Luke says that Nathan was the son of David ([link]Luke 3:31[/link]). [link]First Chronicles 3:5[/link] tells us that Nathan and Solomon were two different persons. Luke's record is the genealogy of David's son Nathan, who was Mary's forefather, whereas Matthew's record is the genealogy of David's son Solomon, who was Joseph's forefather. One genealogy is the line of Mary, the line of the wife; the other is the line of Joseph, the line of the husband. Both Mary and Joseph were descendants of David. Under God's sovereignty they were joined together by marriage, so that through Mary, Joseph was indirectly associated with Christ. Christ can be counted as a descendant of David through either Solomon or Nathan. Hence, He has two genealogies.[br][br]Strictly, Solomon was not a direct forefather of Christ. His relationship with Christ was indirect, through the marriage of Joseph, his descendant, to Mary, of whom Christ was born ([link]v. 16[/link]). The Old Testament did not say that Christ would be Solomon's descendant, but it prophesied repeatedly that Christ would be a descendant of David ([link]2 Sam. 7:13-14[/link]; [link]Jer. 23:5[/link]). Although Christ was not a direct descendant of Solomon, the Old Testament prophecies concerning Christ as a descendant of David were nevertheless fulfilled.</note>
        <note num="4">Uriah was a Hittite, a heathen, and his wife was Bathsheba ([link]2 Sam. 11:3[/link]). David murdered him and took Bathsheba. Hence, she was remarried as a result of murder and adultery ([link]2 Sam. 11:26-27[/link]). David, a man after the heart of God, did right in the eyes of the Lord all the days of his life, except for this one evil ([link]1 Kings 15:5[/link]). This genealogy does not say "of Bathsheba" but "of her who had been the wife of Uriah," to emphasize this great sin of David's, thus showing that Christ as the kingly Savior is related not only to the heathen but also to sinners.</note>

Of the twelve tribes, one was kept for David's sake ([link]1 Kings 11:13[/link]), that is, for Christ. Christ needed the kingdom that belonged to the house of David, because He had to be born as an heir to David's throne.[br][br]After being divided, the kingdom of David was in two parts. The northern part was called the kingdom of Israel (a universal name) and was composed of ten tribes of Israel; the southern part was called the kingdom of Judah (a local name) and was composed of two tribes, Judah and Benjamin. Although the kingdom of Israel was more universal than that of Judah, not one of the names of the kings of Israel was included in the genealogy of Christ. The kings of Israel were excluded because they were not associated with Christ. They were for something other than Christ.</note>

Zerubbabel was not Salathiel's son but was his nephew, and he became his heir. Perhaps this was a case in accordance with [link]Deut. 25:5-6[/link]. Even that word in Deuteronomy is related to the genealogy of Christ.[br][br]Zerubbabel was one of the leaders who returned to Jerusalem from the captivity in Babylon ([link]Ezra 5:1-2[/link]). He was also a leader in the rebuilding of God's temple ([link]Zech. 4:7-10[/link]). The Old Testament predicted that Christ, as a descendant of David, would be born in Bethlehem ([link]Micah 5:2[/link]; [link]Matt. 2:4-6[/link]). Without the return from captivity, it would not have been possible for Christ to be born in Bethlehem. God's command that the captives return was not only for the rebuilding of the temple of God but also to prepare for Christ to be born in Bethlehem. Christ needed some people to be in the proper place to bring Him to earth the first time. Similarly, for His second coming Christ needs some of His people to return from their captivity to the proper church life.</note>

        <note num="2">At this point the record of this genealogy does not say, "Joseph begot Jesus," which is similar to what is said of all the foregoing persons; it says, "Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus." Jesus was born of Mary, and not of Joseph, since it was prophesied that Christ would be the seed of the woman and would be born of a virgin ([link]Gen. 3:15[/link]; [link]Isa. 7:14[/link]). Christ could not have been born of Joseph because Joseph was a man and a descendant of Jeconiah, none of whose descendants could inherit the throne of David ([link]Jer. 22:28-30[/link]). However, Mary was a virgin and a descendant of David ([link]Luke 1:27[/link], [link]31-32[/link]); as such, she was the right person of whom Christ should be born. The marriage of Joseph and Mary brought Joseph into relationship with Christ and united into one the two lines of Christ's genealogy for the bringing in of Christ, as shown in this &#60;a href="chart-geneology.html"&#62;chart&#60;/a&#62;.[br][br]This &#60;a href="chart-geneology.html"&#62;chart&#60;/a&#62; shows that the generation of Jesus Christ begins from God and continues until it reaches Jesus. It proceeds from God to Adam, from Adam to Abraham, from Abraham through Isaac and Jacob, and on to David. After David it divides into two lines, the first running from Nathan to Mary and the second from Solomon to Joseph. Eventually, these two lines are brought together by the marriage of Mary and Joseph, to bring in Jesus Christ. In this way Christ was apparently a descendant of Jeconiah, who seemed to be in the line of the royal family; actually, He was not a descendant of Jeconiah, Joseph's forefather, but a descendant of David, Mary's forefather, so that He could qualify to inherit the throne of David.</note>
        <note num="3">This genealogy first mentions four women who were either remarried or sinful. In addition, here it mentions a chaste virgin. This indicates that all the persons named in this genealogy were born in sin, except Christ, who was born in holiness.[br][br]Abraham, David, and Mary were the three persons crucial to the bringing in of Christ. Abraham represents a life by faith; David, a life under the dealing of the cross; and Mary, a life of absolute surrender to the Lord. It was through these three kinds of lives that Christ was brought forth into humanity.</note>
        <note num="4">[i]Christ[/i] is emphasized here to prove that Jesus is the very Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament.</note>

        <text>Thus [note]1[/note]all the generations from Abraham [note]2[/note]until David are fourteen generations, and from David [note]3[/note]until the deportation to Babylon, fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon [note]4[/note]until the Christ, fourteen generations.</text>
        <note num="1">This genealogy is divided into three ages: (1) from Abraham until David, fourteen generations, the age before the establishing of the kingdom; (2) from David until the deportation to Babylon, fourteen generations, the age of the kingdom; (3) from the deportation to Babylon until the Christ, again fourteen generations, the age after the fall of the kingdom. According to history, there were actually forty-five generations. By deducting from these generations the three cursed generations and the one improper generation, and then adding one by making David two generations (one, the age before the establishing of the kingdom, and the other, the age of the kingdom), the generations total forty-two, being divided into three ages of fourteen generations each. The number fourteen is composed of ten plus four. Four signifies creatures ([link]Rev. 4:6[/link]); ten signifies fullness ([link]25:1[/link]). Hence, fourteen signifies the creatures in full. Fourteen generations being multiplied by three indicates that the Triune God mingles Himself with the creatures in full.[br][br]This genealogy is of three sections: the section of the fathers, the section of the kings, and the section of the civilians, which includes the captured ones and the recovered ones. God the Father corresponds with the section of the fathers, God the Son with the section of the kings, and God the Spirit with the section of the civilians. This too indicates the mingling of the Triune God with His human creatures.[br][br]Three times fourteen is forty-two. Forty is the number for trials, temptations, and sufferings ([link]Heb. 3:9[/link]; [link]Matt. 4:2[/link]; [link]1 Kings 19:8[/link]). Forty-two signifies rest and satisfaction after trial. The children of Israel traveled through forty-two stations before they entered the good land of rest. The millennial kingdom as a rest will come after the forty-two months of the great tribulation ([link]Rev. 13:5[/link]). After all the generations of trials, temptations, and sufferings, Christ came as the forty-second generation to be our rest and satisfaction.</note>
        <note num="2">David is the end of the generations of the fathers and the beginning of the generations of the kings. He was the one person used by God as a landmark to conclude the section of the fathers and to begin the section of the kings.</note>
        <note num="3">At the time of degradation no person was there as a landmark to demarcate the generations as did Abraham and David. Thus, the deportation became a landmark, a landmark of shame.</note>
        <note num="4">Luke's record begins with Jesus and traces back to God. Matthew's record proceeds from Abraham to Christ. Luke goes back and up to God; Matthew comes forward and down to Christ. All the generations were directed to Christ and brought in Christ. Christ is the goal, the consummation, the conclusion, the completion, and the perfection of all the generations; as such, He fulfills their prophecies, solves their problems, and meets their needs. When Christ comes, light, life, salvation, satisfaction, healing, freedom, rest, comfort, peace, and joy all come with Him. From this point on, the whole New Testament is a full expounding of this wonderful Christ, who is everything to us. Hallelujah, Christ has come!</note>

        <note num="1">Under God's sovereign arrangement Caesar Augustus ordered the first census of the Roman Empire ([link]Luke 2:1-3[/link]). It was through that census that Christ was born in Bethlehem ([link]Luke 2:4-7[/link]) to fulfill the prophecy concerning His birth ([link]Micah 5:2[/link]). He stayed there a short time. Then, because of Herod's persecution He was taken to Egypt ([link]vv. 13-15[/link]), and subsequently He was brought back to the land of Israel ([link]vv. 19-21[/link]). Because of Archelaus's reigning over Judea in the place of his father, Herod, Christ was brought to Nazareth, a despised city of Galilee ([link]vv. 22-23[/link]; [link]John 1:45-46[/link]), and was raised there. He was born in the esteemed town of Bethlehem but grew up in the despised city of Nazareth. Hence, He was called a Nazarene. To follow Christ requires that we heed not only the Scriptures concerning Him but also the instant leadings, such as those Joseph had in his dreams. Caring only for the Scriptures while neglecting the instant leadings may cause us to miss Christ, as did the Jewish priests and scribes. Heeding the instant leadings requires a seeking heart.</note>

By the time Jesus was born, the throne of David had been overthrown. This means that the royal stem of David had been cut off. Now a new sprout came forth from the stump of Jesse and grew out of his roots. The emerging and growing of this sprout were in a situation of humiliation. Jesus was not born in a recognized and honored royal home, nor did He grow up in a renowned city such as Jerusalem. Rather, He was born in a poor home and grew up in a despised town. All this made Him a Nazarene, a branch &amp;#8212; not a lofty branch of a stately tree, but a seemingly insignificant sprout from the stump of Jesse.</note>

        <note num="1">The dispensation of law was terminated by the coming of John the Baptist ([link]11:13[/link]; [link]Luke 16:16[/link]). After the baptism by John, the preaching of the gospel of peace began ([link]Acts 10:36-37[/link]). John's preaching was the beginning of the gospel ([link]Mark 1:1-5[/link]). Hence, the dispensation of grace began with John.</note>
        <note num="2">John the Baptist's preaching was the initiation of God's New Testament economy. He did this preaching not in the holy temple within the holy city, where the religious and cultured people worshipped God according to their scriptural ordinances, but in the wilderness, in a "wild" way, not keeping any old regulations. This indicates that the old way of worshipping God according to the Old Testament had been repudiated and that a new way was about to be brought in. [i]Wilderness[/i] here indicates that the new way of God's New Testament economy is contrary to religion and culture. It indicates further that nothing old was left and that something new was going to be built up.</note>

        <note num="1">To repent is to have a change of mind issuing in regret, to have a turn in purpose.</note>
        <note num="2">In John the Baptist's preaching, repentance, as the opening of God's New Testament economy, involved making a turn for the kingdom of the heavens. This indicates that God's New Testament economy is focused on His kingdom. For this we should repent, change our mind, make a turn in our life-pursuit. The goal of our pursuing has been other things; now our pursuing must turn toward God and His kingdom, which in Matthew (cf. [link]Mark 1:15[/link]) is specifically and purposefully called "the kingdom of the heavens." According to the Gospel of Matthew as a whole, the kingdom of the heavens is different from the Messianic kingdom. The Messianic kingdom will be the restored kingdom of David (the rebuilt tabernacle of David &amp;#8212; [link]Acts 15:16[/link]), made up of the children of Israel, and will be earthly and physical in nature; whereas the kingdom of the heavens is constituted of regenerated believers and is heavenly and spiritual. (See note [link]3[sup]4[/sup] in ch. 5[/link].)</note>
        <note num="3">This clearly indicates that before the coming of John the Baptist, the kingdom of the heavens was not there. Even after his appearing, during his preaching, the kingdom of the heavens was still not there; it had only drawn near. At the time the Lord began His ministry, and even at the time He sent His disciples to preach, the kingdom of the heavens had still not come ([link]4:17[/link]; [link]10:7[/link]). Hence, in the first parable in [link]ch. 13[/link], the parable of the seed ([link]13:3-9[/link]), which indicates the Lord's preaching, the Lord did not say, "The kingdom of the heavens is (or, has become) like..." Not until the second parable, the parable of the tares ([link]13:24[/link]), which indicates the establishing of the church on the day of Pentecost, did the Lord say this. [link]Matthew 16:18-19[/link], in which the terms [i]church[/i] and [i]kingdom of the heavens[/i] are used interchangeably, proves that the kingdom of the heavens came when the church was established.</note>

        <note num="1">It was according to prophecy that John the Baptist began his ministry in the wilderness. This indicates that John's introducing of God's New Testament economy was not accidental but had been planned by God and foretold by Him through Isaiah the prophet.

        <note num="1">John was born a priest ([link]Luke 1:5[/link], [link]13[/link]).

However, John did altogether differently. He wore a garment of camel's hair and a leather girdle, and he ate locusts and wild honey. All these things were uncivilized, uncultured, and not according to the religious regulations. For a priestly person to wear camel's hair was an especially drastic blow to the religious mind, for the camel was considered unclean according to the Levitical regulations ([link]Lev. 11:4[/link]). In addition, John did not live in a civilized place but in the wilderness ([link]Luke 3:2[/link]). All this indicates that he had wholly abandoned the Old Testament dispensation, which had degraded into a religion mixed with human culture. His intention was to introduce God's New Testament economy, which is constituted solely of Christ and the Spirit of life.</note>

        <note num="1">To baptize people is to immerse them, to bury them, in water, which signifies death. John the Baptist did this to indicate that he who repents is good for nothing but burial. Further, this signifies that the old person has been terminated so that a new beginning can be realized in resurrection, to be brought in by Christ as the Life-giver. Hence, after John's ministry, Christ came. John's baptism not only terminated those who repented but also ushered them to Christ for life. Baptism in the Bible implies death and resurrection. To be baptized into water is to be put into death and buried. To be raised up from the water means to be resurrected from death.</note>

        <note num="1">According to the context, the fire here is not the fire in [link]Acts 2:3[/link], which is related to the Holy Spirit, but is the same fire as in [link]vv. 10[/link] and [link]12[/link], the fire in the lake of fire ([link]Rev. 20:15[/link]), where the unbelievers will suffer eternal perdition. John's word spoken here to the Pharisees and Sadducees means that if the Pharisees and Sadducees would genuinely repent and believe in the Lord, the Lord would baptize them in the Holy Spirit that they might have eternal life; otherwise, the Lord will baptize them in fire, putting them into the lake of fire for eternal punishment. John's baptism was only for repentance, to usher people to faith in the Lord. The Lord's baptism is either for eternal life in the Holy Spirit or for eternal perdition in fire. The Lord's baptism in the Holy Spirit initiated the kingdom of the heavens, bringing His believers into the kingdom of the heavens, whereas His baptism in fire will terminate the kingdom of the heavens, putting the unbelievers into the lake of fire. Hence, the Lord's baptism in the Holy Spirit, which is based on His redemption, is the beginning of the kingdom of the heavens, whereas His baptism in fire, which is based on His judgment, is the ending of that kingdom. Thus, in this verse there are three kinds of baptisms: the baptism in water, the baptism in the Spirit, and the baptism in fire. The baptism in water by John introduced people to the kingdom of the heavens. The baptism in the Spirit by the Lord Jesus commenced and established the kingdom of the heavens on the day of Pentecost and will carry it on to its consummation at the end of this age. The baptism in fire by the Lord according to the judgment at the great white throne ([link]Rev. 20:11-15[/link]) will conclude the kingdom of the heavens.</note>

        <text>And [note]1[/note]having been baptized, Jesus went up immediately from the water, and behold, the [note]2[/note]heavens were [xref]a[/xref]opened to Him, and He saw the [note]3[/note]Spirit of God descending like a [note]4[/note][xref]b[/xref]dove and coming [xref]c[/xref]upon Him.</text>
        <note num="1">The Lord was baptized not only to fulfill all righteousness according to God's ordination, but also to allow Himself to be put into death and resurrection that He might minister not in a natural way but in the way of resurrection. By being baptized, He was able to live and minister in resurrection even before His actual death and resurrection three and a half years later.</note>
        <note num="2">The Lord's being baptized to fulfill God's righteousness and to be put into death and resurrection brought Him three things: the open heavens, the descending Spirit of God, and the speaking of the Father. It is the same with us today.</note>
        <note num="3">Before the Spirit of God descended and came upon Him, the Lord Jesus was born of the Holy Spirit ([link]Luke 1:35[/link]). This proves that at the time of His baptism He already had the Spirit of God within Him. The Spirit's being within Him was for His birth. Now for His ministry the Spirit of God descended upon Him. This was the fulfillment of [link]Isa. 61:1[/link]; [link]42:1[/link]; and [link]Psa. 45:7[/link], and was carried out to anoint the new King and introduce Him to His people.</note>
        <note num="4">A dove is gentle, and its eyes can see only one thing at a time. Hence, it signifies gentleness and singleness in sight and purpose. By the descending of the Spirit of God like a dove upon Him, the Lord Jesus ministered in gentleness and singleness, focusing solely on the will of God.</note>

This proves that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit exist simultaneously. This is for the accomplishing of God's economy.</note>

        <note num="2">The newly anointed King fasted in His humanity, standing on the ground of man. On the other hand, He was also the Son of God, as God the Father had declared at His baptism ([link]3:17[/link]). For Him to accomplish His ministry for the kingdom of the heavens, He had to defeat God's enemy, the devil, Satan. This He had to do as a man. Hence, He stood as a man to confront the enemy of God. The devil, knowing this, tempted Him to leave the standing of man and assume His position as the Son of God. Forty days before, God the Father had declared from the heavens that He was the beloved Son of the Father. The subtle tempter took that declaration of God the Father as the ground from which to tempt Him. If He had assumed His position as the Son of God before the enemy, He would have lost the standing to defeat him. (See note [link]4[sup]2[/sup][/link].)</note>
        <note num="3">To make the stones become loaves of bread would certainly have been a miracle. This was proposed by the devil as a temptation. Many times the thought of having a miracle performed in certain situations is a temptation from the devil. The devil's temptation of the first man, Adam, concerned the matter of eating ([link]Gen. 3:1-6[/link]). His temptation here of the second man, Christ, also concerned the matter of eating. Eating is always a trap used by the devil to ensnare man, causing man to be tempted in a personal way.</note>

        <note num="1">The Greek word implies [i]happy.[/i] It may also be rendered [i]blessed and happy.[/i] So in succeeding verses. The word spoken by the new King, being the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens, is a revelation of the spiritual living and heavenly principles of the kingdom of the heavens. It is composed of seven sections. The first section, [link]vv. 3-12[/link], depicts the nature of the people of the kingdom of the heavens, who are under nine blessings. They are people who are poor in spirit, who mourn for the present situation, who are meek in suffering opposition, who are hungry and thirsty for righteousness, who are merciful toward others, who are pure in heart, who make peace, who suffer persecution for righteousness, and who are reproached and evilly spoken of because of the Lord.</note>
        <note num="2">To be poor in spirit is not only to be humble but also to be emptied in our spirit, in the depth of our being, not holding on to the old things of the old dispensation but unloaded to receive the new things, the things of the kingdom of the heavens.</note>
        <note num="3">[i]Spirit[/i] here refers not to the Spirit of God but to our human spirit, the deepest part of our being, the organ by which we contact God and realize spiritual things. We need to be poor, emptied, unloaded, in this part of our being that we may realize and possess the kingdom of the heavens. This implies that the kingdom of the heavens is spiritual, not material.</note>
        <note num="4">[i]Kingdom of the heavens[/i] is a term used exclusively by Matthew, indicating that the kingdom of the heavens differs from the kingdom of God (see chart on pp. 22-23 in the printed edition), the latter being mentioned in the other three Gospels. The kingdom of God is God's general reign from eternity past to eternity future. It comprises eternity without beginning before the foundation of the world, the chosen patriarchs (including the paradise of Adam), the nation of Israel in the Old Testament, the church in the New Testament, the coming millennial kingdom (including its heavenly part, the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, and its earthly part, the Messianic kingdom), and the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem in eternity without end. The kingdom of the heavens is a specific section within the kingdom of God, a section composed only of the church today and the heavenly part of the coming millennial kingdom. Hence, in the New Testament, especially in the other three Gospels, the kingdom of the heavens, a section of the kingdom of God, is also called "the kingdom of God." In the Old Testament the kingdom of God, generally, already existed with the nation of Israel ([link]21:43[/link]); the kingdom of the heavens, specifically, had still not come, and it only drew near when John the Baptist came ([link]3:1-2[/link]; [link]11:11-12[/link]).[br][br]According to Matthew there are three aspects concerning the kingdom of the heavens: the reality, the appearance, and the manifestation. The reality of the kingdom of the heavens is the inward content of the kingdom of the heavens in its heavenly and spiritual nature, as revealed by the new King on the mountain in [link]chs. 5-7[/link]. The appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is the outward state of the kingdom of the heavens in name, as revealed by the King on the seashore in [link]ch. 13[/link]. The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens is the practical coming of the kingdom of the heavens in power, as unveiled by the King on the Mount of Olives in [link]chs. 24-25[/link]. Both the reality and the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens are with the church today. The reality of the kingdom of the heavens is the proper church life ([link]Rom. 14:17[/link]), which exists in the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens, known as Christendom. The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens is the heavenly part of the coming millennial kingdom, which is referred to as the kingdom of the Father in [link]13:43[/link]; the earthly part of the millennial kingdom is the Messianic kingdom, which is referred to as the kingdom of the Son of Man in [link]13:41[/link], and which is the restored tabernacle of David, the kingdom of David ([link]Acts 15:16[/link]). In the heavenly part of the millennial kingdom, which is the kingdom of the heavens manifested in power, the overcoming believers will reign with Christ for a thousand years ([link]Rev. 20:4[/link], [link]6[/link]); in the earthly part of the millennial kingdom, which is the Messianic kingdom on earth, the saved remnant of Israel will be the priests and will teach the nations to worship God ([link]Zech. 8:20-23[/link]).[br][br]If we are poor in spirit, the kingdom of the heavens is ours: we are in its reality now in the church age, and we will share in its manifestation in the kingdom age.</note>

        <note num="1">The third section of the King's word on the mountain, [link]vv. 17-48[/link], concerns the law of the people of the kingdom of the heavens.</note>
        <note num="2">Here for Christ to fulfill the law means (1) that, on the positive side, He kept the law, (2) that, on the negative side, through His substitutionary death on the cross He fulfilled the requirement of the law, and (3) that in this section He complemented the old law with His new law, as repeatedly expressed by the word "But I say to (or, tell) you" ([link]vv. 22[/link], [link]28[/link], [link]32[/link], [link]34[/link], [link]39[/link], [link]44[/link]). Christ's keeping of the law qualified Him to fulfill the requirement of the law through His substitutionary death on the cross. Christ's fulfilling of the requirement of the law through His substitutionary death on the cross brought in the resurrection life to complement the law, to fill the law to the full. The old law, the lower law, with the demand that it be kept and the requirement that man be punished, is over. The kingdom people, as the children of the Father, now need to fulfill only the new law, the higher law, by the resurrection life, which is the eternal life of the Father. The old law was given through Moses, whereas the new law was decreed by Christ personally.[br][br]Concerning the law there are two aspects: the commandments of the law and the principle of the law. The commandments of the law were fulfilled and complemented by the Lord's coming, whereas the principle of the law was replaced by the principle of faith according to God's New Testament economy.</note>

        <note num="1">Righteousness here does not refer only to objective righteousness, which is the Christ whom we receive when we believe in Him and are thus justified before God ([link]1 Cor. 1:30[/link]; [link]Rom. 3:26[/link]); it refers even more to subjective righteousness, which is the indwelling Christ lived out of us as our righteousness that we may live in the reality of the kingdom today and enter into its manifestation in the future. This subjective righteousness is obtained not by merely the fulfilling of the old law, but by the complementing of the old law through the fulfilling of the new law of the kingdom of the heavens given by the new King here in this section of the Word. This righteousness of the kingdom people, which is according to the new law of the kingdom, surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, which is according to the old law. It is impossible for our natural life to gain this surpassing righteousness; it can be produced only by a higher life, the resurrection life of Christ. This righteousness, which is likened to the wedding garment ([link]22:11-12[/link]), qualifies us to participate in the wedding of the Lamb ([link]Rev. 19:7-8[/link]) and inherit the kingdom of the heavens in its manifestation, that is, to enter into the kingdom of the heavens in the future.[br][br]The righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees is the righteousness of letters, which they practiced by their own life according to the old law of letters; the surpassing righteousness of the kingdom people is the righteousness of life, which they live out by taking Christ as their life according to the new law of life. Both in nature and in standard, the righteousness of life far surpasses the lifeless righteousness practiced by the scribes and Pharisees.</note>

        <note num="2">The law of the old dispensation deals with the act of murder ([link]v. 21[/link]), but the new law of the kingdom deals with anger, the motive of murder. Hence, the demand of the new law of the kingdom is deeper than the requirement of the law of the old dispensation. To meet the demand of the new law of the kingdom, the higher life of the new creation is needed.</note>

        <note num="4">In this verse there are three kinds of judgments. The first is the judgment at the gate of the city, which is the district judgment. The second is the judgment by the Sanhedrin, which is a higher judgment. The third is the judgment by God through the Gehenna of fire, which is the highest judgment. These three kinds of judgments were mentioned here by the new King, who used figures from the Jewish background because His entire audience was Jewish. However, in regard to the kingdom people, the believers of the New Testament, all these judgments refer to the judgment of the Lord at the judgment seat of Christ, as revealed in [link]2 Cor. 5:10[/link]; [link]Rom. 14:10[/link], [link]12[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 4:4-5[/link]; [link]3:13-15[/link]; [link]Matt. 16:27[/link]; [link]Rev. 22:12[/link]; and [link]Heb. 10:27[/link], [link]30[/link]. This clearly reveals that the New Testament believers, although forgiven by God forever, are still liable to the Lord's judgment, a judgment not for perdition but for discipline, if they sin against the new law of the kingdom as given here. However, when we sin against the new law of the kingdom, we will be forgiven and cleansed by the blood of the Lord Jesus if we repent and confess our sins ([link]1 John 1:7[/link], [link]9[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">For the kingdom people to be perfect as their heavenly Father is perfect means that they are perfect in His love. They are the Father's children, having the Father's divine life and divine nature. Hence, they can be perfect as their Father is. The demand of the new law of the kingdom is much higher than the requirement of the law of the old dispensation. This higher demand can be met only by the Father's divine life, not by the natural life. The kingdom of the heavens is the highest demand, and the divine life of the Father is the highest supply to meet that demand. First, the gospel presents in the Gospel of Matthew the kingdom of the heavens as the highest demand, and last, it affords us in the Gospel of John the divine life of the heavenly Father as the highest supply, by which we can have the highest living of the kingdom of the heavens. The demand of the new law of the kingdom in [link]chs. 5-7[/link] is actually the expression of the new life, the divine life, which is within the regenerated kingdom people. This demand opens up the inner being of the regenerated people, showing them that they are able to attain to such a high level and to have such a high living.</note>

        <note num="1">In calling people to follow Him for the kingdom, the King of the heavenly kingdom ministered as a Physician, not as a Judge. A judge's judgment is according to righteousness, whereas a physician's healing is according to mercy and grace. Those whom He made people of His heavenly kingdom were lepers ([link]8:2-4[/link]), paralytics ([link]8:5-13[/link]; [link]9:2-8[/link]), the fever-ridden ([link]8:14-15[/link]), the demon-possessed ([link]8:16[/link], [link]28-32[/link]), those ill with all kinds of diseases ([link]8:16[/link]), despised tax collectors, and sinners ([link]vv. 9-11[/link]). If He had visited these pitiful people as a Judge, all would have been condemned and rejected, and none would have been qualified, selected, and called to be the people of His heavenly kingdom. However, He came to minister as a Physician, to heal, recover, enliven, and save them that they might be reconstituted to be His new and heavenly citizens, with whom He could establish His heavenly kingdom on this corrupted earth.</note>

        <note num="1">[link]Verses 10-13[/link] record the Lord's dealing with the question from the Pharisees, who were of the old religion. Here in [link]vv. 14-17[/link] the Lord dealt with the problem of John's disciples, who were of the new religion. John the Baptist had dropped the old religion and had begun his ministry in the wilderness, outside religion. (See notes [link chapter="3"]1[sup]2[/sup][/link] and [link]4[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 3[/link].) However, after a short time his disciples formed a new religion that frustrated people from enjoying Christ, just as the Pharisees of the old religion had done. John the Baptist's ministry was to introduce people to Christ that Christ might become their Redeemer, their life, and their all. However, some of John's disciples drifted away from his goal, Christ, to some of his practices, and made those practices a religion. To be religious is to do something for God, without Christ. To do anything, even if it is scriptural and fundamental, without the presence of Christ is to be religious. Both John's disciples, who were of the new religion, and the Pharisees, who were of the old religion, fasted much, but without Christ. Meanwhile, they condemned the disciples of Christ, who did not fast but had Christ with them and lived in His presence.</note>

        <note num="2">In dealing with the self-righteous and dissenting Pharisees, who were of the old religion, the kingly Savior indicated that He was a Physician who had come to heal the sick ([link]v. 12[/link]). In dealing with the fasting and dissenting disciples of John, who were of the new religion, He revealed Himself as the Bridegroom who had come to take the bride. John the Baptist had told his disciples that Christ was the Bridegroom who had come to take the bride ([link]John 3:25-29[/link]). Now Christ, the kingly Savior, reminded some of them of this. Both a physician and a bridegroom are pleasant persons. The kingly Savior first healed His followers, and then made them the sons of the bridechamber; eventually, He will make them His bride. They should have laid hold of Him not only as their Physician, that their life might be recovered, but also as their Bridegroom, that they might have the enjoyment of living in His presence. They were with Him at a joyful wedding, not without Him at a mournful funeral. How then could they fast and not feast before Him? The dissenting question from John's disciples indicated that some of them had fallen into a new religion and had rejected the kingly Savior.[br][br]The question from John's disciples seemed to relate to doctrine. However, the Lord answered not with a doctrine but with a person, the most pleasant person, the Bridegroom. The religious people always care for their doctrine, asking "why" in a doctrinal way. But Christ cares only for Himself. The living and walk of His followers should be regulated and directed only by Himself and His presence, not by any doctrine.</note>

The Greek word is formed with [i]not[/i] and [i]to card or comb wool.[/i] Thus, the word means [i]uncarded, unsteamed and unwashed, unfinished, unfulled, untreated.[/i] The unfulled cloth signifies Christ from His incarnation to His crucifixion, as a piece of new cloth, untreated, unfinished; whereas the new garment in [link]Luke 5:36[/link] signifies Christ as a new robe after He was "treated" in His crucifixion. (The Greek word for [i]new[/i] in [link]Luke 5:36[/link] is the same as for [i]fresh[/i] in [link]Matt. 9:17[/link].) Christ first was the unfulled cloth for making a new garment, and then through His death and resurrection was made a new garment to cover us as our righteousness before God that we might be justified by God and be acceptable to Him ([link]Luke 15:22[/link]; [link]Gal. 3:27[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 1:30[/link]). A patch of unfulled cloth sewn on an old garment pulls away from the garment because of the strength of its shrinking, thus making the tear worse. To sew a patch of unfulled cloth on an old garment means to imitate what Christ did in His human life on earth. This is what today's modernists are attempting to do. They only imitate Jesus' human deeds to improve their behavior; they do not believe in the crucified Jesus as their Redeemer or in the resurrected Christ as their righteousness that they may be justified by God and acceptable to Him. Their imitating of Christ's human living "pulls away" from their "old garment," their behavior produced by their old, natural life. The kingdom people would not do this; they take the crucified and resurrected Christ as their new garment to cover them as their righteousness before God.</note>
        <note num="2">The old garment signifies the good behavior, good deeds, and religious practices produced by man's old, natural life.</note>

        <text>Neither do they put [note]1[/note]new wine into [note]2[/note][xref]a[/xref]old wineskins; otherwise, the wineskins burst, and the wine pours out, and the wineskins are ruined; but they put new wine into [note]3[/note][xref]b[/xref]fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.</text>
        <note num="1">The Greek word for [i]new[/i] means [i]new in time, recent, newly possessed.[/i] The new wine here signifies Christ as the new life, full of vigor, stirring people to excitement. The kingly Savior is not only the Bridegroom to the kingdom people for their enjoyment but also their new garment for them to be equipped outwardly that they may be qualified to attend the wedding. Furthermore, He is their new life to stir them up inwardly to enjoy Him as their Bridegroom. He, as the heavenly King, is the Bridegroom for the kingdom people's enjoyment, and His heavenly kingdom is His wedding feast ([link]22:2[/link]), at which they will enjoy Him. To enjoy Him as the Bridegroom in the kingdom feast, they need Him as their new garment outwardly and their new wine inwardly.</note>
        <note num="2">The old wineskins signify religious practices, such as the fasting maintained by the Pharisees, who were of the old religion, and by the disciples of John, who were of the new religion. All religions are old wineskins. New wine put into old wineskins bursts the wineskins by the power of its fermenting. To put new wine into old wineskins is to put Christ as the exciting life into any kind of religion. This is what the so-called fundamentalists and Pentecostalists are practicing today. They attempt to squeeze Christ into their different modes of religious ritual, formality, and practice. The kingdom people should never do this. They must put the new wine into fresh wineskins.</note>
        <note num="3">The Greek word for [i]fresh[/i] means [i]new in nature, quality, or form; unaccustomed, unused;[/i] hence, fresh. The fresh wineskins signify the church life in the local churches as the container of the new wine, which is Christ Himself as the exciting life. The kingdom people are built into the church ([link]16:18[/link]), and the church is expressed through the local churches in which the kingdom people live ([link]18:15-20[/link]). They are regenerated persons who constitute the Body of Christ and become the church ([link]Rom. 12:5[/link]; [link]Eph. 1:22-23[/link]). The Body of Christ as His fullness is also called "the Christ" ([link]1 Cor. 12:12[/link]), referring to the corporate Christ. The individual Christ is the new wine, the inward exciting life, and the corporate Christ is the fresh wineskin, the outward container that holds the new wine. With the kingdom people it is not a matter of fasting or any other religious practice, but a matter of the church life with Christ as their content. Christ came to establish not an earthly religion of rituals but a heavenly kingdom of life. He is establishing such a kingdom not with any dead religious practices but with Himself, the living person, as the Savior, the Physician, the Bridegroom, the unfulled cloth, and the new wine to His followers for their full enjoyment, that they may be the fresh wineskin to contain Him and may become the constituents of His kingdom.</note>

After the woman was healed, the daughter was revived. Subsequently, two blind men and one dumb man were healed. This is a type, showing that when the Jews were cut off, the Gentiles were saved, and that after the fullness of the salvation of the Gentiles, the Jews will be saved ([link]Rom. 11:15[/link], [link]17[/link], [link]19[/link], [link]23-26[/link]).

        <note num="1">John the Baptist's word here does not mean that he was in doubt concerning Christ. He questioned Christ in this way in order to provoke Him to deliver him. He knew that Christ was the Coming One, and he had strongly recommended Him to the people ([link]John 1:26-36[/link]). After that, John was put into prison ([link]4:12[/link]), where he waited, expecting that Christ would do something to deliver him. However, Christ did nothing for him, although He did much to help others. When John heard of this, it might have been that he was about to be stumbled ([link]v. 6[/link]). Hence, he sent his disciples with such a question to provoke Christ.</note>

        <note num="1">Lit., less. All the prophets prior to John prophesied only that Christ was coming, but John testified that Christ had come. The prophets were looking forward to Christ, but John saw Christ. Hence, John was greater than all the prophets. Although John saw the incarnated Christ and introduced Him to people, he did not have the resurrected Christ indwelling him. The kingdom people do. John could say only, "Here is Christ," but the kingdom people can say, "To me, to live is Christ" ([link]Phil. 1:21[/link]). Hence, the least in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he.

The Lord lived such a life, caring for nothing but the will of His Father ([link]John 4:34[/link]; [link]5:30[/link]; [link]6:38[/link]). He submitted Himself fully to the Father's will ([link]26:39[/link], [link]42[/link]). Hence, He asks us to learn from Him.</note>
        <note num="3">To be meek, or gentle, means not to resist opposition, and to be lowly means not to have self-esteem. Throughout all the opposition the Lord was meek, and throughout all the rejection He was lowly in heart. He submitted Himself fully to the will of His Father, not wanting to do anything for Himself or expecting to gain something for Himself. Hence, regardless of the situation He had rest in His heart; He was fully satisfied with His Father's will.</note>
        <note num="4">The rest that we find by taking the Lord's yoke and learning from Him is for our souls. It is an inward rest; it is not anything merely outward in nature.</note>

Hence, to profane the Sabbath was a serious matter in the eyes of the religious Pharisees. To them it was not lawful, not scriptural. But they did not have adequate knowledge of the Scriptures. Based on their meager knowledge, they cared for the ritual of keeping the Sabbath, not for the hunger of the people. What folly to observe a vain ritual!</note>

        <note num="1">The Pharisees said that it was not lawful for the Lord's disciples to pick the ears in the grainfields and to eat; thus, they condemned the disciples for acting contrary to the Scriptures. But the Lord answered, "Have you not read...?" pointing out to them another aspect of the Scriptures that justified Him and His disciples. The Pharisees were thus condemned for lacking adequate knowledge of the Scriptures.</note>
        <note num="2">The Lord's word here implies that He is the real David. In the ancient time David and his followers, when rejected, entered into the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence ([link]v. 4[/link]), seemingly breaking the Levitical law. Now the real David and His followers were rejected, and the disciples took action to pick ears of grain and eat, seemingly going against the sabbatical regulation. Just as David and his followers were not held guilty, so Christ and His disciples should not have been condemned.[br][br]Furthermore, the Lord's word here implies the dispensational change from the priesthood to the kingship. In the ancient time the coming of David changed the dispensation from the age of the priests to the age of the kings, in which the kings were above the priests. In the age of the priests the leader of the people had to listen to the priest ([link]Num. 27:21-22[/link]). But in the age of the kings the priest had to submit to the king ([link]1 Sam. 2:35-36[/link]). Hence, what King David did with his followers was not illegal. Now the coming of Christ changed the dispensation again, this time from the age of the law to the age of grace, in which Christ is above all. Whatever He does is right.</note>

In the case of David there was a turn from one age to another. In this case, a case concerning the priests, there was a turn from the temple to a person who is greater than the temple. Since the priests were guiltless in acting on the Sabbath in the temple, how could the Lord's disciples be guilty in acting on the Sabbath in Him who is greater than the temple? In the first case the king broke the Levitical regulation; in the second case the priests broke the sabbatical regulation. According to the Scriptures neither was guilty.

If a sinner blasphemes the Son, as Saul of Tarsus did, the Spirit will still have the ground to work on him and cause him to repent and believe in the Son that he may be forgiven (see [link]1 Tim. 1:13-16[/link]). But if a sinner blasphemes the Spirit, the Spirit will have no ground to work on him, and there will be no one left to cause him to repent and believe. Hence, it is impossible for such a person to be forgiven. This is not only logical according to reason but also governmental according to God's administrative principle, as revealed here by the Lord's word.</note>
        <note num="2">In God's governmental administration His forgiveness is dispensational. For His administration He has planned different ages. The period from the first coming of Christ to eternity is divided dispensationally into three ages: (1) this age, the present one, from Christ's first coming to His second coming; (2) the coming age, the millennium, the one thousand years for restoration and heavenly reigning, from Christ's second coming to the end of the old heaven and old earth; and (3) eternity, the eternal age of the new heaven and new earth. God's forgiveness in this age is for sinners' eternal salvation. This forgiveness is given to both sinners and believers. God's forgiveness in the coming age is related to the believers' dispensational reward. If after being saved a believer commits a sin but will not make a clearance through confession and the cleansing of the Lord's blood ([link]1 John 1:7[/link], [link]9[/link]) before he dies or the Lord comes back, the sin will not be forgiven in this age but will remain and will be judged at the judgment seat of Christ ([link]2 Cor. 5:10[/link]). In such a case, the believer will not be rewarded with the kingdom, i.e., will not participate with Christ in the glory and joy in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, but will be disciplined so that the sin is cleared, and will be forgiven in the coming age ([link]18:23-35[/link]). This kind of forgiveness will maintain this believer's eternal salvation but will not qualify him to participate in the glory and joy of the coming kingdom.</note>

Here the Lord likened the evil generation of the rejecting Jews to the demon-possessed man. In the eyes of the Lord the rejecting Jews were like the demon-possessed people. The signs of Jonah and Solomon indicated that the Gentiles would repent, but the case of the demon-possessed man indicated that the rejecting Jews would not repent. They would only sweep away the dirt and decorate by adding good things to beautify themselves. They would not receive Christ and allow Him to fill them. Rather, they would remain empty and unoccupied. This is the actual condition of today's Jews. Near the end of this age they will be seven times more possessed by demons, and their state will become worse than ever.</note>

The King's going out of the house to sit beside the sea signifies that after His break with the Jews, He forsook the house of Israel and turned to the Gentiles. It was after this, while on the seashore, that He gave the parables concerning the mysteries of the kingdom. This signifies that the mysteries of the kingdom were revealed in the church.

        <note num="1">The fruit of the wheat in the first two parables and the fruit of the mustard seed here in the third parable are for food.

        <note num="1">The church, which is the embodiment of the kingdom, should be like an herb that produces food. However, its nature and function were changed, so that it became a "tree," a lodging place for birds. (This is against the law of God's creation, that is, that every plant must be after its kind &amp;#8212; [link]Gen. 1:11-12[/link].) This change happened in the first part of the fourth century, when Constantine the Great mixed the church with the world. He brought thousands of false believers into Christianity, making it Christendom, no longer the church. Hence, this third parable corresponds with the third of the seven churches in [link]Rev. 2[/link] and [link book="Rev."]3[/link], the church in Pergamos ([link]Rev. 2:12-17[/link] &amp;#8212; see note [link]12[sup]1[/sup][/link] there). The mustard is an annual herb, whereas the tree is a perennial plant. The church, according to its heavenly and spiritual nature, should be like the mustard, sojourning on the earth. But with its nature changed, the church became deeply rooted and settled as a tree in the earth, flourishing with its enterprises as the branches in which many evil persons and things are lodged. This resulted in the formation of the outward organization of the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens.</note>
        <note num="2">Since the birds in the first parable signify the evil one, Satan ([link]vv. 4[/link], [link]19[/link]), the birds of heaven here must refer to Satan's evil spirits with the evil persons and things motivated by them. They lodge in the branches of the great tree, that is, in the enterprises of Christendom.</note>

        <note num="2">The church as the practical kingdom of the heavens, with Christ, the unleavened fine flour, as its content, must be a loaf of unleavened bread ([link]1 Cor. 5:7-8[/link]). However, the Catholic Church, which was fully and officially formed in the sixth century and which is signified by the woman here, took in many pagan practices, heretical doctrines, and evil matters and mixed them with the teachings concerning Christ, leavening the whole content of Christianity. This mixture became the corrupted content of the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens. This fourth parable corresponds with the fourth of the seven churches in [link]Rev. 2[/link] and [link book="Rev."]3[/link], the church in Thyatira ([link]Rev. 2:18-29[/link] &amp;#8212; see note [link]20[sup]1[/sup][/link] there).</note>

Three measures is the quantity needed to make a full meal ([link]Gen. 18:6[/link]). Hence, the hiding of the leaven in three measures of meal signifies that the Catholic Church has fully leavened in a hidden way all the teachings concerning Christ. This is the actual situation in the Roman Catholic Church. Such leavening is absolutely against the Scriptures, which strongly forbid putting any leaven into the meal offering ([link]Lev. 2:4-5[/link], [link]11[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">Because He had been rejected by the people in religious, cultured, and political circles, the heavenly King departed from them and withdrew to a deserted place privately. This indicates that thenceforth He would hide Himself in a deserted place, in a place without culture, away from the religious, cultured, and political circles. He did this by means of a boat, implying that He would do this through the church. Because He has been rejected by the civilized world, the Lord, through the church, has always hidden Himself in a realm without much culture, away from religious and political circles.</note>
        <note num="2">In spite of the rejection by all kinds of people, there were still a large number of people who followed the heavenly King. They did this by leaving their cities. It was not that the King came to their cities to visit them, but that they left their cultured cities to follow Him in a deserted place. Through all the centuries the true followers of Christ have left cultured spheres to follow their heavenly King outside the cultured world.</note>

        <note num="1">The disciples asked the Lord to send the crowds away so that the crowds could go to buy food for themselves ([link]v. 15[/link]), but the Lord told the disciples to give the crowds something to eat. The disciples' concept was to ask people to do something; this is the principle of the law. But the Lord's concept is to give people something to enjoy; this is the principle of grace.</note>
        <note num="2">In this record of the miracle, the Holy Spirit's intention in His inspiration is to show that what the followers of the heavenly King actually need is the proper food to satisfy their hunger. The disciples of Christ did not know this, nor did the crowds who followed. The heavenly King knew this and did something in a miraculous way to impress them with their real need and His provision for that need. All that they needed was His resurrection life, which would satisfy their spiritual hunger, as signified in this miracle.[br][br]What the heavenly King did indicates strongly and clearly that He provides for the necessities of His followers while they follow Him in this rejecting world. This corresponds with His word in the heavenly constitution saying that the kingdom people need not be anxious about what they will eat ([link]6:31-33[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">[link]John 6:9[/link] tells us that these five loaves were barley loaves. Barley is a type of the resurrected Christ ([link]Lev. 23:10[/link]). Thus, the barley loaves signify Christ in resurrection as food to us. Loaves are of the vegetable life, signifying the generating aspect of Christ's life, whereas fish are of the animal life, signifying the redeeming aspect of Christ's life. For our spiritual hunger to be satisfied, we need Christ's generating life as well as His redeeming life. Both aspects are symbolized by small items &amp;#8212; loaves and fish. This indicates that in this age the heavenly King came to His followers not as a great King to reign over them but as small pieces of food to feed them.

        <note num="1">The Jewish religionists accused the Lord's disciples of transgressing their tradition, but the Lord condemned the religionists for transgressing the commandment of God because of their tradition. They cared for their tradition, but they ignored God's commandment. In principle, the religious people today do the same thing.

        <note num="1">The Lord's dealing here with the Pharisees and scribes not only condemned them for making void the word of God because of their tradition but also implied that man should honor his parents. God in His government among men has ordained that man should honor his parents. He has made this the first commandment among the Ten Commandments that concerns human relationships ([link]Exo. 20:12[/link]). Fallen human nature, however, always prompts man to ignore his parents, that is, to rebel against God's government. In order to bring man back to God's government, the Lord as the heavenly King emphasized that man should honor his parents. This corresponds with His word in the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens concerning the fulfillment of the law ([link]5:17-19[/link]). Hence, the apostle also emphasized this matter strongly ([link]Eph. 6:1-3[/link]; [link]Col. 3:20[/link]). We, the kingdom people, must honor our parents and not excuse ourselves as the Jewish religionists did. To make any excuse indicates that we are not under the heavenly ruling but are following our fallen nature and the rebellious trend of today's generation.</note>

Here another opportunity was created for Him to reveal Himself, this time as the children's bread.

        <note num="1">Jonah was the prophet who turned from Israel to the Gentiles and was put into the belly of the great fish. After remaining there for three days, he emerged to become a sign to that generation for repentance ([link]Jonah 1:2[/link], [link]17[/link]; [link]3:2-10[/link]). He was a type of Christ, who, as the Prophet sent by God to His people ([link]Deut. 18:15[/link], [link]18[/link]), would turn from Israel to the Gentiles, would be buried in the heart of the earth for three days, and would then be resurrected, becoming a sign to that generation for salvation. The Lord's word here implies that for that evil and adulterous Jewish and religious generation, the Lord would do nothing but die and be resurrected as a sign, the greatest sign, to them that they might be saved if they would believe.</note>

Our soul-life is embodied in and lived out by our self, and our self is expressed through our mind, our thought, our concept, our opinion. When we set our mind not on the things of God but on the things of men, our mind grasps the opportunity to act and express itself. This was what happened with Peter. Hence, the Lord's subsequent word indicated that Peter had to deny himself, i.e., not save his soul-life but lose it. Losing the soul-life is the reality of denying the self. This is to take up the cross.</note>
        <note num="3">The cross is not merely a suffering; it is also a killing. It kills and terminates the criminal. Christ first bore the cross and then was crucified. We, His believers, first were crucified with Him and now bear the cross. To us, to bear the cross is to remain under the killing of the death of Christ for the terminating of our self, our natural life, and our old man.

        <note num="1">The record from [link]13:53-17:8[/link] portrays the way to follow the heavenly King, from His rejection to the entering of the manifestation of the kingdom. His followers not only shared His being rejected by the Jews ([link]13:53-58[/link]) but also were persecuted and even martyred by Gentile politics ([link]14:1-12[/link]). They were in a deserted place with Him in a situation of poverty, yet they were richly cared for by Him ([link]14:13-21[/link]). When they were on the stormy sea under the contrary wind, He walked on the sea, calmed the storm, and brought them through ([link]14:22-34[/link]). At that point many sick ones were healed by touching Him ([link]14:35-36[/link]), but the hypocritical worshippers of God came to heckle Him because His followers transgressed their tradition ([link]15:1-20[/link]). Then His disciples followed Him to a Gentile region, where a demon-possessed Gentile was healed ([link]15:21-28[/link]). After that, they followed Him along the sea of Galilee and up the mountain, where all kinds of sick people were healed and the need of His followers and the crowd was again richly provided for in a barren wilderness ([link]15:29-39[/link]). After that, both the fundamentalists and the modernists of that day came to tempt Him, and He indicated that He would die to be a unique sign to them ([link]16:1-4[/link]). Then He charged His followers to beware of the leaven of both the fundamentalists and the modernists ([link]16:5-12[/link]). After all that, He brought His followers to the border of the Holy Land, close to a Gentile land, that they might have a revelation of Him, of the church, and of the cross as the way for them to enter into the kingdom ([link]16:13-28[/link]). Finally, He brought them into glory in the manifestation of the kingdom ([link]vv. 1-8[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">Since the Lord's transfiguration occurred six days after the revelations (given at the foot of Mount Hermon) in [link]ch. 16[/link] concerning Christ and the church, the high mountain here must be Mount Hermon. To receive the revelation concerning Christ and the church, we must be far away from the religious environment; but to see the vision of the transfigured Christ, we need to be on a high mountain, far above the earthly level.</note>

No one except Jesus Himself should remain in the New Testament. Jesus is today's Moses; as such, He imparts the law of life into His believers.

Now, in application of what he had seen, he was put to the test by the poll tax gatherers' question.

In John, to have eternal life is to be saved by God's uncreated life that we may live by that life today and for eternity; but in Matthew, to have eternal life is to participate in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens in this age by God's eternal life and to share in the kingdom's manifestation in the coming age, thereby enjoying God's eternal life in a fuller way.</note>

        <note num="3">Here to enter into life means to enter into the kingdom of the heavens ([link]v. 23[/link]). The kingdom of the heavens is a realm of God's eternal life. Hence, when we enter into it, we enter into God's life. This differs from being saved. To be saved is to have God's life enter into us to be our life, whereas to enter into the kingdom of the heavens is to enter into God's life to enjoy the riches of God's life. The former is to be redeemed and regenerated by the Holy Spirit, whereby we receive God's life; the latter is to live and walk by God's life. One is a matter of life; the other is a matter of living. See note [link]16[sup]1[/sup][/link].</note>
        <note num="4">This is not the requirement for salvation; it is related to entering into the kingdom of the heavens. According to the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens, to enter into the kingdom of the heavens requires us to meet not only the standard of the old law but also the standard of the complemented new law given by the King ([link]5:17-48[/link]).

        <note num="1">As portrayed in [link]21:23-22:46[/link], during His last visit to Jerusalem, the center of Judaism, Christ was surrounded by the chief priests, elders, Pharisees, Herodians, and Sadducees, along with a lawyer, all of whom endeavored to ensnare Him by asking puzzling and insidious questions. First, the chief priests, representing the authority of the Jewish religion, and the elders, representing the authority of the Jewish people, asked Him concerning His authority ([link]21:23[/link]). Their question was according to their religious concept. Second, the Pharisees, the fundamentalists, and the Herodians, who were zealous in politics, asked Him a question related to politics. Third, the Sadducees, the modernists, questioned Him concerning fundamental belief. Fourth, a self-approved lawyer asked Him a question concerning the law. After answering all their questions wisely, He asked them a question concerning the Christ. This is the question of questions. Their questions were related to religion, politics, belief, and the law. His question was concerning the Christ, who is the center of all things. They knew religion, politics, belief, and the law, but they paid no attention to Christ. Hence, He asked them, "What do you think concerning the Christ?" This question of questions must be answered by everyone.</note>

        <note num="1">The Lord's answer has three sections: the first section ([link]vv. 4-31[/link]) concerns the Jews, who are the chosen; the second ([link]v. 32-25:30[/link]) concerns the church; and the third ([link]25:31-46[/link]) concerns the Gentiles (the nations). The first section, concerning the Jews, should be interpreted literally, whereas the second section, concerning the church, should be interpreted spiritually, because it is spoken in parables for the reason given in [link]13:11-13[/link].

The birth pangs here are suffered only by the New Testament believers for the Lord's sake, whereas the travailing in birth in [link]Rev. 12:2[/link] refers to all the travailings suffered throughout the generations by God's people in both the Old Testament and the New Testament. These tribulations, along with the preaching of the gospel ([link]v. 14[/link]), are used by God to produce His many sons so that He can constitute the church in this age, accomplish the kingdom in the coming age, and produce the New Jerusalem in eternity as the ultimate consummation of the church and the kingdom that He may have an eternal expression in eternity future.

All people in Adam are dead ([link]1 Cor. 15:22[/link]); thus, the evil Antichrist, who with his evil armies will war against the Lord at Armageddon ([link]Rev. 19:17-21[/link]), is in the eyes of the Lord a stinking corpse, good for the vultures' appetite. Furthermore, in the Scriptures both the Lord and those who trust in Him are likened to an eagle ([link]Exo. 19:4[/link]; [link]Deut. 32:11[/link]; [link]Isa. 40:31[/link]), and the swift, destroying armies are likened to flying eagles ([link]Deut. 28:49[/link]; [link]Hosea 8:1[/link]). Hence, the vultures here, being predatory birds of the eagle kind, refer undoubtedly to Christ and His overcomers, who will come as a swift, flying army to war against Antichrist and his armies and destroy them at Armageddon, thus executing God's judgment upon them. This indicates not only that at His appearing, Christ with His overcoming saints will appear in the place where Antichrist is with his armies, but also that Christ with His overcomers will appear swiftly from the air like vultures. This corresponds with the flash of lightning in the foregoing verse.</note>

        <note num="1">A talent, the largest unit of weight, was worth six thousand denarii (see note [link]7[sup]1[/sup] in John 6[/link]). In the parable of the virgins, oil signifies the Spirit of God ([link]vv. 3-4[/link]), whereas in this parable, talents signify spiritual gifts ([link]Rom. 12:6[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 12:4[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 4:10[/link]; [link]2 Tim. 1:6[/link]). For life we need oil, the Spirit of God, even His filling, that we may be enabled to live the virgin life for the Lord's testimony; for service, for work, we need the talent, the spiritual gift, that we may be equipped as a good slave to accomplish what the Lord intends to accomplish. The filling of the Spirit in life enables us to use the spiritual gift in service (work), and the spiritual gift in service matches the filling of the Spirit in life, that we may be a perfect member of Christ.</note>
        <note num="2">[i]Own ability[/i] signifies our natural ability, which is constituted of God's creation and our learning.</note>

        <note num="1">The main emphasis in this parable is on the one-talented one, who received the smallest gift. It is very easy for the least gifted to mistreat or ignore their gift.</note>
        <note num="2">The earth signifies the world; thus, [i]dug in the earth[/i] signifies becoming involved in the world. Any association, any involvement, with the world, even a little worldly talk, will bury the gift we have received from the Lord.</note>
        <note num="3">[i]Hid his master's money[/i] signifies rendering the Lord's gift useless, letting it lie waste under the cloak of certain earthly excuses. To make any excuse for not using the Lord's gift is to hide the gift. This is always the danger with the one-talented ones, those who consider their gift to be the smallest.</note>

Although the gift given to the two-talented one was smaller than that given to the five-talented one, the Lord's appraisal and reward were the same in both cases.

        <note num="1">The Lord's blood redeemed us from our fallen condition back to God and back to God's full blessing. Concerning the Lord's table ([link]1 Cor. 10:21[/link]), the bread signifies our participation in life, and the cup, our enjoyment of God's blessing. Hence, the cup is called "the cup of blessing" ([link]1 Cor. 10:16[/link]). In it are all the blessings of God and even God Himself as our portion ([link]Psa. 16:5[/link]). In Adam our portion was the cup of God's wrath ([link]Rev. 14:10[/link]). Christ drank that cup for us ([link]John 18:11[/link]), and His blood constitutes the cup of salvation for us ([link]Psa. 116:13[/link]), the cup that runs over ([link]Psa. 23:5[/link]).

The Lord shed His blood, God established the covenant, and we enjoy the cup, in which God and all that is of Him are our portion. The blood is the price that Christ paid for us, the covenant is the title deed that God made for us, and the cup is the portion that we receive from God.</note>

        <note num="3">Baptism brings the repentant people out of their old state into a new one by terminating their old life and germinating them with the new life of Christ that they may become the kingdom people. John the Baptist's recommending ministry began with a preliminary baptism, a baptism by water only. Now, after the heavenly King had accomplished His ministry on earth, had passed through the process of death and resurrection, and had become the life-giving Spirit, He charged His disciples to baptize the discipled people into the Triune God. This baptism has two aspects: the visible aspect by water and the invisible aspect by the Holy Spirit ([link]Acts 2:38[/link], [link]41[/link]; [link]10:44-48[/link]). The visible aspect is the expression, the testimony, of the invisible aspect, whereas the invisible aspect is the reality of the visible aspect. Without the invisible baptism by the Spirit, the visible baptism by water is vain, and without the visible baptism by water, the invisible baptism by the Spirit is abstract and impractical. Both are needed. Not long after the Lord charged the disciples with this baptism, He baptized them and the entire church in the Holy Spirit ([link]1 Cor. 12:13[/link]), the Jewish part on the day of Pentecost ([link]Acts 1:5[/link]; [link]2:4[/link]) and the Gentile part in the house of Cornelius ([link]Acts 11:15-17[/link]). Then, based on this, the disciples baptized the new converts ([link]Acts 2:38[/link]) not only into water but also into the death of Christ ([link]Rom. 6:3-4[/link]), into Christ Himself ([link]Gal. 3:27[/link]), into the Triune God ([link]v. 19[/link]), and into the Body of Christ ([link]1 Cor. 12:13[/link]). The water, signifying the death of Christ with His burial, may be considered a tomb in which the baptized ones' old history is ended. Since the death of Christ is included in Christ, and since Christ is the very embodiment of the Triune God ([link]Col. 2:9[/link]) and the Triune God eventually is one with the Body of Christ, to baptize new believers into the death of Christ, into Christ Himself, into the Triune God, and into the Body of Christ is to do just one thing: on the negative side, to terminate their old life, and on the positive side, to germinate them with new life, the eternal life of the Triune God, for the Body of Christ. Hence, the baptism ordained by the Lord here baptizes people out of their life into the Body life for the kingdom of the heavens.</note>

To baptize people into the name of the Triune God is to bring them into spiritual and mystical union with Him.</note>
        <note num="5">There is one name for the Divine Trinity. The name is the sum total of the Divine Being, equivalent to His person. To baptize someone into the name of the Triune God is to immerse him into all that the Triune God is.</note>
        <note num="6">Matthew and John are the two books in which the Divine Trinity is revealed more fully than in all the other books of the Scripture, that God's chosen people may participate in and enjoy Him. For our experience of life, John unveils the mystery of the Godhead in the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, especially in [link]chs. 14-16[/link]; whereas for the constituting of the kingdom, Matthew discloses the reality of the Divine Trinity by giving one name for all three. In the opening chapter of Matthew, the Holy Spirit ([link]1:18[/link]), Christ (the Son &amp;#8212; [link]1:18[/link]), and God (the Father &amp;#8212; [link]1:23[/link]) are present for the producing of the man Jesus ([link]1:21[/link]), who, as Jehovah the Savior and God with us, is the very embodiment of the Triune God. In [link]ch. 3[/link] Matthew presents a scene in which the Son was standing in the water of baptism under the opened heaven, the Spirit like a dove descended upon the Son, and the Father spoke out of the heavens to the Son ([link]3:16-17[/link]). In [link]ch. 12[/link] the Son, in the person of man, cast out demons by the Spirit to bring in the kingdom of God the Father ([link]12:28[/link]). In [link]ch. 16[/link] the Father revealed the Son to the disciples for the building of the church, which is the life pulse of the kingdom ([link]16:16-19[/link]). In [link]ch. 17[/link] the Son entered into transfiguration ([link]17:2[/link]) and was confirmed by the Father's word of delight ([link]17:5[/link]), bringing about a miniature display of the manifestation of the kingdom ([link]16:28[/link]). Eventually, in the closing chapter, after Christ as the last Adam had passed through the process of crucifixion, entered into the realm of resurrection, and become the life-giving Spirit, He came back to His disciples in the atmosphere and reality of His resurrection to charge them to make the heathen the kingdom people by baptizing them into the name, the person, the reality, of the Divine Trinity. Later, in the Acts and the Epistles it is disclosed that to baptize people into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is to baptize them into the name of Christ ([link]Acts 8:16[/link]; [link]19:5[/link]), and that to baptize them into the name of Christ is to baptize them into Christ the person ([link]Gal. 3:27[/link]; [link]Rom. 6:3[/link]), because Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God, and He, having become the life-giving Spirit ([link]1 Cor. 15:45[/link]), is available at any time and in any place for people to be baptized into. According to Matthew, being baptized into the reality of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is for the constituting of the kingdom of the heavens. Unlike an earthly society, the heavenly kingdom cannot be formed with human beings of flesh and blood ([link]1 Cor. 15:50[/link]); it can be constituted only with people who have been immersed into the union with the Triune God and who have been established and built up with the Triune God, who has been wrought into them.</note>

        <note num="1">Like baptizing people into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, which is mentioned in the foregoing verse, teaching the believers to observe all that the Lord has commanded is for the discipling of all the nations ([link]v. 19[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">The heavenly King is Emmanuel, God with us ([link]1:23[/link]). Here He promised that in His resurrection He will be with us all the days, with all authority, until the consummation of the age, that is, until the end of this age. Hence, wherever we are gathered into His name, He is in our midst ([link]18:20[/link]).[br][br]Among the four Gospels the Lord's ascension is recorded only in Mark ([link]Mark 16:19[/link]) and Luke ([link]Luke 24:51[/link]). John testifies that the Lord, as the Son of God, even God Himself, is life to His believers. As such, He can never and would never leave them. Matthew proves that He, as Emmanuel, is the heavenly King who is with His people continuously until He comes back. Hence, in John and Matthew the Lord's ascension is not mentioned.</note>
