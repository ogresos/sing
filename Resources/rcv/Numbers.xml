        <note num="1">The children of Israel encamping in array typifies God's redeemed people being consummated in the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem has twelve gates, three gates on each of the four sides, with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel on them ([link]Rev. 21:12-13[/link]). In Numbers the twelve tribes were arranged into an array, in which three tribes, each tribe being an army, were encamped on each of the four sides of the tabernacle ([link]vv. 2-31[/link]). Four camps of three armies each yields the number twelve. This number, composed of three multiplied by four, signifies the Triune God (three) mingled with His creatures (four), forming a unit of eternal and perfect government (cf. note [link]12[sup]2[/sup] in Rev. 21[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">Every man encamping by his own standard with the ensign of his father's house signifies that God's people were arranged not by their choice according to their preference but according to God's ordination and arrangement (cf. [link]1 Cor. 12:18[/link], [link]28[/link]).</note>
        <note num="3">Or, a distance from. That the children of Israel were encamped facing the Tent of Meeting indicates that the testimony of God &amp;#8212; the Ark within the tabernacle, which contained the law as God's testimony ([link]Exo. 25:16[/link]) &amp;#8212; was their unique center and goal (see notes [link]1[sup]1[/sup] in Exo. 20[/link] and [link]10[sup]1[/sup] in Exo. 25[/link]). This signifies that Christ, the embodiment of God, is the center and goal of God's people, who are journeying and fighting for God's testimony.[br][br]The children of Israel encamping around the Tent of Meeting indicates that they were formed into an army to fight for the protection of God's testimony (the Ark in the tabernacle, typifying Christ and His Body, the church, as the incarnated and embodied God). In the same way, the church today is fighting for the protection of the incarnated God. God in Himself needs no protection, but God in His embodiment needs to be protected by the fighting of the church as a formed, coordinated Body ([link]Matt. 16:18[/link] and note 6; [link]John 1:14[/link] and note 2; [link]Eph. 6:10-20[/link] and note [link]11[sup]2[/sup][/link], par. 2).</note>

In the Old Testament there was a distinction between the priests and the Levites. However, in the New Testament there is only one class, that of the priests ([link]Rom. 15:16[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 2:5[/link], [link]9[/link]; [link]Rev. 1:6[/link]; [link]5:10[/link]), which includes the Levites. Hence, what the Levites did in the Old Testament in type, the believers as the New Testament priests should also do in reality. The fact that the service of the Levites was under the supervision of the priests indicates that when the New Testament priests do the outward Levitical work, they must do it under the supervision of the inward, spiritual view of the New Testament priesthood. The Levitical service should never be separated from the priestly view. The outward service must become a spiritual activity that ministers life to others.</note>

        <note num="1">The three kinds of defilement dealt with in the camp of Israel typify all the uncleanness that needs to be dealt with in the church. Leprosy signifies the evil issues of the natural man, especially in rebellion (see note [link]2[sup]1[/sup] in Lev. 13[/link]). Spiritually, discharges are the excessive, abnormal, and unrestrained issues of the natural man, signifying one's being without control, unbridled, in relation to one's self, temper, preferences, likes, and dislikes (see notes [link book="Lev." chapter="15"]2[sup]1[/sup][/link] and [link]4[sup]1[/sup] in Lev. 15[/link]). Uncleanness through contact with the dead signifies the defilement of spiritual deadness that issues from contacting those who are spiritually dead (see notes on [link]Lev. 11:31[/link]). God is righteous, holy, and living. Thus, these three kinds of defilement cannot be allowed to remain in God's dwelling place, army, and priesthood.</note>

        <note num="1">Lit., shall be wonderful to vow a vow. A Nazarite was sanctified by making a special vow to separate himself to God. The priests, who were such by birth, were ordained by God out of His initiation, whereas the Nazarite, who became such by a vow, was separated to God by himself out of his initiation. God's ordaining of one family (Aaron's) to be the priests excluded all others from this opportunity. But the vow of the Nazarite opens the gate, affording all the people of God an equal opportunity to be absolutely for God as a warrior ([link]Judg. 13:5[/link]) or as a priest ([link]1 Sam. 1:11[/link]; [link]2:11[/link]). Whoever is willing may take this opportunity on his own initiative. The accomplishing of God's purpose requires man's cooperation to complement God's ordination, as illustrated by the case of Samuel, who as a Nazarite fulfilled the duty of a priest, complementing the deficient Eli, a priest ordained by God ([link]1 Sam. 1-3[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">God desires that all His people be Nazarites. To be a Nazarite is to be sanctified, separated, absolutely and ultimately to God, i.e., to be for nothing other than God.

        <note num="1">The shaving of the head did not mean that the Nazarite put away the headship and gave up his submission.

        <note num="1">The blessing in [link]vv. 23-27[/link] comes after the dealing with defilement ([link]5:1-10[/link]), the test for chastity ([link]5:11-31[/link]), and the Nazarite vow ([link]vv. 1-21[/link]). This blessing, like that in [link]2 Cor. 13:14[/link], is not outward and material. Rather, it is the eternal blessing of the Triune God, which is the Triune God dispensing Himself in His Divine Trinity into us for our enjoyment. In the entire universe the unique blessing is the Triune God, and this blessing comes to us through the dispensing of the divine Being into us in His Divine Trinity &amp;#8212; in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. [link]Ephesians 1[/link] gives us a record of how the Triune God blesses His chosen, redeemed, and transformed people in His Divine Trinity, issuing in the church as the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all (see notes in [link]Eph. 1[/link]). As the consummation of the entire record of the Bible, the New Jerusalem is the very God in His Divine Trinity &amp;#8212; the Father, the Son, and the Spirit &amp;#8212; mingled with His chosen, redeemed, transformed, and glorified people as their eternal blessing. Such a blessing is the ultimate fulfillment of God's blessing to Israel in [link]Num. 6[/link].[br][br]"Jehovah bless you and keep you" ([link]v. 24[/link]) can be ascribed to the Father; "Jehovah make His face shine upon you and be gracious to you" ([link]v. 25[/link]) can be ascribed to the Son; and "Jehovah lift up His countenance upon you and give you peace" ([link]v. 26[/link]) can be ascribed to the Holy Spirit. The Father blesses us, the Son shines upon us, and the Holy Spirit lifts up His countenance upon us. As a result, we are kept, we receive grace, and we have peace.</note>

        <note num="1">The word [i]face[/i] here signifies presence. As the One whose face shines upon us, Christ the Son is the visible presence of the invisible God (cf. [link]John 14:7-9[/link]). God and His presence are invisible, but through His incarnation He became the shining sun ([link]Luke 1:78[/link]; cf. [link]Matt. 4:16[/link]; [link]John 8:12[/link]). This shining sun is God's invisible presence becoming visible.</note>
        <note num="2">Jehovah's face shining on us and His being gracious to us are equivalent to God's incarnation as the shining of His presence, which was accompanied by grace ([link]John 1:14[/link], [link]16-17[/link]). For the Lord to be gracious to us means that He is continually grace to us. This grace is the grace of Christ ([link]2 Cor. 13:14a[/link]), which is actually Christ Himself.</note>

        <note num="1">The face ([link]v. 25[/link]) denotes the presence of the person, and the countenance denotes the expression of the person. To lift up one's countenance upon a person means to confirm, assure, promise, and give everything to that person. Jesus, the Son, came as the face of God (see note [link]25[sup]1[/sup][/link]), and the Holy Spirit comes as the countenance of God (cf. [link]Eph. 4:30[/link]). When the Triune God is dispensed into us, we have the face of the Triune God and also His countenance. Eventually, we are kept in the Triune God, the Triune God becomes grace to us, and we have peace.</note>

Hence, to anoint signifies to apply the processed and consummated Triune God with all His elements and processes as a whole to the object of the anointing, thus making this object absolutely one with the compounded, consummated God. For us to be anointed ([link]2 Cor. 1:21[/link]) means that the processed Triune God is put into us and upon us and even mingled with us to make us God-men, those who are one with God.

Because the offerers were sinful, in their coordinating with God they also offered twelve oxen, twelve rams, twelve lambs a year old, and their meal offering for the burnt offering; twelve male goats for a sin offering; and twenty-four oxen, sixty rams, sixty male goats, and sixty male lambs a year old for the peace offering ([link]vv. 87-88[/link]). These offerings signify Christ as our sin offering to redeem us from sin, Christ as our burnt offering for our living to God, and Christ as our peace offering, through which we and God enjoy Christ mutually in peace. All these offerings were for the worship of God, signifying that in order to worship God, we must offer ourselves to Him; then we must offer Christ as our sin offering, burnt offering, and peace offering so that we and God may enjoy Christ in mutuality and be satisfied with Him.[br][br]Twelve is the number of absolute perfection and eternal completion in God's administration (see notes [link book="Rev." chapter="21"]12[sup]2[/sup][/link], [link book="Rev." chapter="21"]16[sup]2[/sup][/link], and [link]17[sup]1[/sup] in Rev. 21[/link]).

Every aspect of the service in the tabernacle had to be exact; no mistakes were tolerated. Therefore, those who served in and around the tabernacle had to be trained to do things accurately. After a Levite had completed his five-year apprenticeship, he was qualified, at the age of thirty, to serve in the tabernacle.</note>

Because God is serious about the laws governing the tabernacle, the offerings, and the Levitical work, there was the need of some experienced ones to instruct God's people, especially the young ones, so that they would not become careless and unconsciously offend God in their service. The same need exists regarding the service in the church.</note>

        <text>Now Jehovah had spoken to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai in the [note]1[/note]first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,</text>
        <note num="1">[link]Chapters 1-8[/link] of this book were spoken by God to Moses on the first day of the second month in the second year after the exodus from Egypt ([link]1:1[/link]), whereas the words in [link]9:1-14[/link] were spoken in the first month of the same year ([link]v. 1[/link]). In the second month as Moses was recording all the divine speakings, God must have charged him to write something concerning the passover, of which God had spoken to Moses in the first month. Moses' recording of God's charge concerning the passover at this juncture indicates that after fulfilling the divine requirements and partaking of the divine provisions in the first eight chapters of this book, God's people should have a corporate feast to enjoy Christ before God and with God for their mutual satisfaction. This shows the importance of keeping the passover in relation to the move of God's redeemed people with God in His activity. Similarly, because the Lord's table has much to do with God's move on earth, the New Testament believers must keep the Lord's table ([link]1 Cor. 11:23-26[/link]).</note>

Both the passover and the Lord's table remind us that we were destined to die under God's righteous judgment, but God prepared Christ to be our replacement to die for us, thus saving us from the death-judgment of God's righteousness. Furthermore, they remind us that we do not belong to ourselves but to the One who replaced us and who is now our life and life supply. Since Christ is our life and life supply, we should live by Him ([link]John 6:57[/link]).</note>

Of the five basic offerings ([link]Lev. 1-7[/link]) these two were great enjoyments to God and His people. When in the church today God's children are absolute for God and dwell together with God in peace, there is a great day, a day worthy of the blowing of trumpets.</note>

        <note num="1">God's guidance to His people in a general way was by the cloud and the trumpets ([link]9:15-10:10[/link]), whereas His leading of His people in a particular way was through the Ark ([link]vv. 33-36[/link]), a type of the crucified and resurrected Christ in His resurrection. Hence, the unique Leader of God's people is not any man (cf. [link]vv. 29-32[/link]) but is the crucified and resurrected Christ ([link]Matt. 23:10[/link]). He is the Leader, and He leads us to the proper place of rest on the long and rugged journey of the Christian life ([link]Heb. 4:8-9[/link] and notes).[br][br]The leading of the Ark of the Covenant indicates that the leading of Christ is faithful, according to a covenant. God made a covenant with Abraham and his descendants to bring them into the good land ([link]Gen. 17:1-8[/link]; cf. note [link]20[sup]1[/sup] in Exo. 23[/link]). Eventually, God's covenant was placed in the Ark; thus, the Ark was called the Ark of the Covenant. Hence, the Christ who leads us into a resting place is the Christ of the covenant, the Christ of God's faithfulness (cf. [link]2 Cor. 1:19-20[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">Miriam and Aaron were Moses' blood relatives and were both prophets ([link]Exo. 4:10-16[/link]; [link]6:30-7:1[/link]; [link]15:20[/link]). Their word here indicates that, being older than Moses, they regarded themselves higher than Moses and were jealous of the greater respect that Moses received. Miriam and Aaron took Moses' apparent mistake in marrying a Cushite woman as an excuse to slander him ([link]v. 1[/link]); however, the real issue here concerned the question of who had God's oracle. Although Miriam and Aaron were used by God to speak for Him, neither was God's spokesman; only one, Moses, had the oracle of God. Being jealous of Moses, Miriam and Aaron were in rivalry with Moses in the matter of speaking for God.[br][br]In speaking against Moses, Miriam and Aaron were speaking against the deputy authority of God. God had appointed Moses to be His deputy authority, His representative authority on earth ([link]Exo. 3:10-18a[/link]; [link]7:1[/link]). According to God's governmental administration, Miriam and Aaron should have submitted themselves to Moses. But they rebelled.</note>

Moses did not fight back; rather, he brought the rebels and the ones against whom they rebelled to God. As God's deputy, or delegated, authority, Moses referred this case to God as the highest authority, for His speaking, exposing, and judging. In a struggle for power the only One who can judge and expose the real situation is God Himself.</note>

Such a Christ imparts life to others ([link]John 12:24[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 1:3[/link]). Today He is still budding, and we are the fruit, the almonds, of His budding.[br][br]Since the rebellion of Korah and his company in [link]ch. 16[/link] was related to the priesthood ([link]16:3[/link], [link]8-10[/link]), the budding of Aaron's rod was a vindication indicating that Aaron was the one accepted by God as having authority in the God-given ministry of the priesthood.</note>

All three items are types of Christ. The three items placed in the Ark in the Holy of Holies also refer to the three of the Divine Trinity: the hidden manna in the golden pot refers to God the Father as the divine source of all supply ([link]John 6:32[/link]), the budding rod signifies Christ as the resurrection ([link]John 11:25[/link]), and the tablets of the law refer to the Spirit of life as the inner law ([link]Rom. 8:2[/link]). Thus, the Holy of Holies is the dwelling place of God in His Divine Trinity. When we enter into the Holy of Holies, i.e., into our regenerated spirit (see note [link]19[sup]1[/sup] in Heb. 10[/link]), we enter into God and meet the Father as the source of supply, the Son as the resurrection, and the Spirit as the law of life.</note>

        <note num="1">The tithe from the Levites was considered a heave offering, which typifies the ascended Christ. This thought corresponds to the Lord's word in [link]Matt. 6:19-20[/link], where we are told to "store up for yourselves treasures in heaven" rather than on earth. To store up treasures in heaven is to "send" our money to heaven, and to do this is to "heave up" our money (cf. [link]Phil. 4:18[/link]).</note>

This became God's food, a portion of which was also the food of the priests. Thus, the Levites lived on the tithe from the people, and God and the priests lived on the tithe from the Levites.[br][br]God and His people, including the serving ones, were one large family. In this family God the Father as the source gave the good land to His children, who then had to work the land. Eventually, they reaped a harvest, which was to be enjoyed by both God and all the people. They were to bring a portion of the produce to the serving ones, and the serving ones were to offer a portion of what they received to God. In this way, God and His serving ones shared the tithes and lived together. The good land is a type of the all-inclusive Christ (see note [link]7[sup]1[/sup] in Deut. 8[/link]). God's food is the riches of Christ, typified by the produce of the good land, and this produce comes through our labor. We need to labor on Christ and experience Christ. Then Christ will be the produce not only for our satisfaction but also for God's satisfaction.</note>

Our service to God in the New Testament is not in the realm of material things; therefore, our reward is not in that realm.

        <note num="1">The rock in this chapter typifies the crucified and resurrected Christ ([link]1 Cor. 10:4b[/link]), and the water that flowed from the rock typifies the Spirit ([link]1 Cor. 10:4a[/link]) as the living water that flowed out of the crucified Christ ([link]John 19:34[/link] and note). In [link]Exo. 17[/link] Moses struck the rock with his rod, and water flowed out for the people to drink (see notes [link book="Exo." chapter="17"]6[sup]2[/sup][/link] and [link]6[sup]3[/sup] in Exo. 17[/link]). According to Paul's word in [link]1 Cor. 10:4[/link] (see note [link book="1 Cor." chapter="10"]4[sup]2[/sup][/link] there), this rock was a spiritual rock that followed God's people in their journey through the wilderness. This signifies that Christ has been crucified to become a rock that follows His people. This following rock is the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit ([link]1 Cor. 15:45[/link]), who is always with the church to supply His believers with the water of life.[br][br]Since Christ has been crucified and the Spirit has been given, there is no need for Christ to be crucified again, i.e., no need to strike the rock again, that the living water may flow. In God's economy Christ should be crucified only once ([link]Heb. 7:27[/link]; [link]9:26-28a[/link]). To receive the living water from the crucified Christ, we need only to "take the rod" and "speak to the rock." To take the rod is to identify with Christ in His death and apply the death of Christ to ourselves and our situation. To speak to the rock is to speak a direct word to Christ as the smitten rock, asking Him to give us the Spirit of life (cf. [link]John 4:10[/link]) based on the fact that the Spirit has already been given. If we apply the death of Christ to ourselves and ask Christ in faith to give us the Spirit, we will receive the living Spirit as the bountiful supply of life ([link]Phil. 1:19[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">To sanctify God is to make Him holy, i.e., separate from all the false gods; to fail to sanctify God is to make Him common. In being angry with the people ([link]v. 10[/link]) and in wrongly striking the rock twice ([link]v. 11[/link]), Moses failed to sanctify God. In being angry when God was not angry, Moses did not represent God rightly in His holy nature, and in striking the rock twice, he did not keep God's word in His economy (see note [link]8[sup]1[/sup][/link], par. 2). Thus, Moses offended both God's holy nature and His divine economy. Because of this, even though he was intimate with God and may be considered a companion of God ([link]Exo. 33:11[/link]), Moses lost the right to enter the good land.[br][br]In all that we say and do concerning God's people, our attitude must be according to God's holy nature, and our actions must be according to His divine economy. This is to sanctify Him. Otherwise, in our words and deeds we will rebel against Him and offend Him.</note>

        <note num="1">In the typology of the Old Testament, Canaan has two aspects: on the positive side Canaan, a land of riches ([link]Deut. 8:7-10[/link] and note [link]7[sup]1[/sup][/link]), typifies the all-inclusive Christ with His unsearchable riches ([link]Col. 1:12[/link]; [link]Eph. 3:8[/link]), and on the negative side, it signifies the aerial part, the heavenly part, of the dark kingdom of Satan. As the ruler of this world ([link]John 12:31[/link]) and as the ruler of the authority of the air ([link]Eph. 2:2[/link]), Satan has his authority ([link]Acts 26:18[/link]) and his angels ([link]Matt. 25:41[/link]), who are his subordinates as principalities, powers, and rulers of the darkness of this world ([link]Eph. 6:12[/link]). Hence, he has his kingdom ([link]Matt. 12:26[/link]), the authority of darkness ([link]Col. 1:13[/link]). The Canaanites typify the fallen angels, the rebellious angels who follow Satan ([link]Rev. 12:4[/link], [link]7[/link]), who have become the powers, rulers, and authorities in Satan's kingdom (cf. [link]Dan. 10:13[/link], [link]20[/link]). The fighting of the children of Israel against the Canaanites that they might possess and enjoy the good land typifies the spiritual warfare of the church as a whole, including all the members, against "the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies" ([link]Eph. 6:12[/link]) that the saints may enjoy Christ as the all-inclusive land. The church must be such a corporate warrior, fighting against Satan's aerial forces so that God's people may gain more of Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ, establishing and spreading the kingdom of God so that Christ can come back to inherit the earth.</note>

In order for the children of Israel to enter into the good land, they had to pass through the territory controlled by these kings and had to fight against them, destroy them, and take over their territory. This signifies that in order to enjoy the unsearchably rich Christ, the church must defeat and take over the territory of the enemies signified by these kings.

        <note num="1">The five daughters of Zelophehad typify all the believers in Christ, who are females, weaker ones ([link]1 Pet. 3:7[/link]), in the sight of God. Hence, their request ([link]v. 4[/link]) is for us all. In order to keep their father's name and his inheritance within their tribe, the daughters of Zelophehad took the way of fellowship by contacting their stronger kinsmen ([link]v. 4[/link]). The same principle applies to the keeping of the enjoyment of Christ by the weaker believers in the church life.</note>
        <note num="2">In the Bible inheritance is determined according to genealogy, according to the source of life and the fellowship of life. The fact that the daughters of Zelophehad were of one of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph indicates that they were in the life and the fellowship of life of the proper origin. This indicates that in order to inherit Christ as our good land, we must have the proper origin of life; i.e., we must be born of God to be His children ([link]John 1:12-13[/link]).[br][br]The father's family signifies the church ([link]Eph. 2:19[/link]). If we would enjoy Christ as our inheritance, participating in His riches, we must also have the church life. If we give up the church life with the fellowship of life, we will spontaneously lose our right to inherit the enjoyment of Christ.</note>

        <note num="1">When God brought His people into the wilderness, He spoke to them through Moses ([link]12:6-8a[/link]); but Joshua, Moses' successor, was to receive guidance not from God by His direct speaking but by the Urim and the Thummim on the breastplate worn by Eleazar the priest (see notes [link book="Exo." chapter="28"]30[sup]1[/sup][/link] through [link]30[sup]3[/sup] in Exo. 28[/link]). God's government among His people was a matter not of autocracy or democracy but of theocracy, carried out through the coordination of the high priest, who received God's instructions, and the leader, who executed these instructions. After Moses, throughout the generations in the Old Testament the divine government depended on the two persons of the high priest and the leader, the only exception being the time when David served as both the leader and the priest wearing the ephod ([link]1 Sam. 23:9[/link]; [link]30:7[/link]). When the children of Israel came back from captivity, a later Joshua was the high priest, and Zerubbabel, a royal descendant, was the leader ([link]Hag. 1:1[/link]). See note [link]18[sup]1[/sup] in Deut. 16[/link].[br][br]At the end of this chapter the children of Israel had become a new people formed into a new army with a new theocracy.</note>

        <note num="1">God's food consists of the offerings offered to Him by His people, which typify different aspects of Christ (see notes in [link]Lev. 1-7[/link]), who is the reality of and replacement for all the Old Testament offerings ([link]Heb. 10:5-9[/link]). Christ is God's daily food ([link]vv. 3-8[/link]), weekly food ([link]v. 9[/link]), monthly food ([link]vv. 11-15[/link]), and yearly food ([link]28:16-29:38[/link]).

This indicates that when we serve God, offering Christ to Him as His food, God shares a portion of His food with us. First, we enjoy Christ as the One given to us by God. Having experienced Christ, we present Him to God as His food, and then God shares with us a portion of the Christ we have offered to Him.

The more God's people enjoy Christ and experience Christ, the more they fulfill God's economy, and the more they are able to offer Christ to God as food. Thus, Christ is God's food in the way of fulfilling God's eternal economy. In [link]Num. 28-29[/link] there are three sections: the section pertaining to the daily life of God's people (see note [link]2[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 28[/link]), the section pertaining to the church (from the Feast of Passover to the Feast of Pentecost, i.e., Weeks), and the section pertaining to the future of Israel (from the Feast of the Blowing of Trumpets to the Feast of Tabernacles). Each section is for the fulfillment of God's eternal economy. Because Christ is everything for the fulfillment of God's economy, in each section He is God's food, God's satisfaction, served to God by His people and enjoyed with God by them. For eternity Christ will be God's satisfaction, and for eternity we will enjoy the Christ who satisfies God.</note>

        <note num="1">In typology, the Midianites signify the filthiness of the lust of the flesh, which is related to the devil Satan and the world ([link]1 John 2:16a[/link]; [link]5:19[/link]). The Midianites were descendants of Abraham, born of his second wife, Keturah. Hence, by nature they were close to the Israelites in the flesh ([link]Gen. 25:1-2[/link]). The Midianites were united with the Moabites, the descendants of Lot born through incest in the lust of the flesh ([link]Num. 22:3-4[/link], [link]7[/link]; [link]Gen. 19:30-38[/link]). Furthermore, the Midianites were one with the Ishmaelites, the descendants of Abraham by the flesh, who sold Joseph into Egypt ([link]Gen. 37:27-28[/link], [link]36[/link]). The Midianites were also connected with the Amalekites, the descendants of Esau ([link]Judg. 6:3[/link], [link]33[/link]; [link]Gen. 36:12[/link]). Finally, the Midianites produced Balaam, who ensnared the children of Israel in fornication and idolatry ([link]Num. 22:7[/link]; [link]31:16[/link]).[br][br]By ensnaring the sons of Israel in fornication and idolatry, the Midianites offended Israel to the uttermost, with the result that more than twenty thousand lives were lost. God would not forget that, and He charged Moses to avenge Israel on the Midianites.</note>

        <note num="1">The cities of refuge typify the all-inclusive Christ as the embodiment of the redeeming God, into whom mistaken sinners can flee for refuge. Christ was delivered by God into the hands of sinners ([link]Acts 2:23[/link]; [link]Rom. 4:25[/link]), who mistakenly put Him to death ([link]Luke 23:34[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 2:8[/link]). If any sinner repents, God will regard him as a mistaken sinner and will forgive him ([link]Luke 24:47[/link]; [link]Acts 2:38[/link]). Such a one may flee into Christ. But if anyone refuses the gospel and does not repent, God will regard him as a willful sinner, one who is destined to perish ([link]v. 16[/link]; [link]John 3:16-18[/link]).[br][br]There were six cities of refuge, three on each side of the Jordan ([link]v. 14[/link]). The number six signifies mistake-making man, who was created by God on the sixth day ([link]Gen. 1:26-27[/link], [link]31[/link]). The number three signifies the Triune God as the refuge for the man who makes mistakes. The number two (the two sets of three cities each) signifies a testimony standing in the universe, testifying and declaring to the universe that the Triune God is living on earth among human beings to be their city of refuge.</note>

        <note num="1">The number forty-eight is composed of six (the natural man created by God on the sixth day) multiplied by eight (resurrection). The forty-eight cities given to the Levites signify the natural man, who became fallen, being brought into resurrection through the Levitical service. The Levitical service was a service to the priesthood, and the goal of the priesthood was to bring fallen man back to God in resurrection. The number of cities given to the Levites thus signifies the purpose of the Levitical service.[br][br]The number forty-eight is also composed of four (also signifying man as God's creature &amp;#8212; [link]Ezek. 1:5[/link]) multiplied by twelve (the number of perfection and completion in God's eternal administration). Hence, the number forty-eight indicates that man, who was created by God, will be perfected and completed in the eternal administration of God.</note>

        <note num="1">That the cities of refuge were to be not only for the children of Israel but also for the strangers and sojourners among them signifies that the Triune God as the refuge for mistake-making man is for all mankind.

        <note num="1">The high priest here signifies Christ ([link]Heb. 4:14[/link]), who died for our sins. Spiritually, the Old Testament saints had to remain in the city of refuge until Christ died; no ransom could have released them before the time of Christ's death ([link]v. 32[/link]). This was a refuge prior to direct salvation. In the Old Testament time Christ had not yet died, and those who fled into Him as their refuge had to wait there until He came and died on the cross. For the Old Testament saints, therefore, the refuge was like the sheepfold in [link]John 10:1[/link] (see note 2 there).[br][br]Since Christ, our High Priest, has died, He is the refuge, not in the Old Testament sense but in the New Testament sense, to all His believers. This refuge is a matter of direct salvation. Before Christ's death He was the refuge for the Old Testament saints, but now, after His death, He is our direct salvation. We who enter into Christ today may do so with the assurance that He has already died and that our sins have already been forgiven ([link]Eph. 1:7[/link]; [link]Col. 2:13[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">The books of Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers portray in typology God's need for a people to be saved and to go on with Him to enjoy His Christ, to receive His revelation, and to be built up with Him as the processed Triune God, that they may be formed into a priestly army to journey with Him and to fight with Him. These books also show that God's people need to be disciplined by passing through certain difficulties and undergoing different kinds of frustrations. In [link]Exo. 12-14[/link] Israel as God's people was redeemed from God's judgment by the passover and saved from Egypt by the saving power of the Triune God. Then, they enjoyed the heavenly provision and the divine care in their initial journey in the wilderness ([link]Exo. 15-17[/link]). In [link]Exo. 19-40[/link] and [link]Lev. 1-27[/link] they received the divine revelation and training in knowing God, in being built up together with God as His dwelling on earth for His expression and testimony, and in the building up of the priesthood for the divine service. All this took place at the foot of Mount Sinai, where the people were given the law as a portrait of what God is in His attributes. The book of Numbers records how God's chosen and redeemed people were formed into a priestly army to journey with God and to fight with God for His interest on earth ([link]chs. 1-4[/link]; [link]9:15-10:36[/link]; [link]12:16[/link]; [link]20:1-21:35[/link]; [link]31:1-54[/link]; [link]33:1-49[/link]). In Numbers the children of Israel also passed through various frustrations, trials, and disciplinings for their purification. Eventually, in [link]ch. 32[/link] and in [link]33:50-36:13[/link] God's people received the prearrangement for the distribution of the promised good land. After all the foregoing, God's chosen and redeemed people were ready to cross the Jordan, enter Canaan, consume its inhabitants, and possess the good land promised by the faithful God ([link]Josh. 1:2-3[/link]). With the exception of Joshua and Caleb, those who were qualified to take possession of the land were the younger ones, the second generation of those who had come out of Egypt. This younger generation had received the benefit of all that the first generation had experienced. With a rich inheritance and strong background, they were qualified to be formed into an army to fight with God and for God for the accomplishing of His economy. This history of Israel is a full type of the history of the church in its accomplishing of God's eternal economy in the mystical union with the all-inclusive Christ, who is the embodiment of the processed and dispensing Triune God ([link]1 Cor. 5:6-8[/link]; [link]10:1-13[/link]; [link]Heb. 3:7-4:13[/link]).
