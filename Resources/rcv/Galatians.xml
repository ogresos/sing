        <text>[note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]Paul, an [xref]b[/xref]apostle ([note]2[/note][xref]c[/xref]not from men nor through man but [xref]d[/xref]through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who [note]3[/note][xref]e[/xref]raised Him from the dead),</text>
        <note num="1">The books of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians form a cluster of Epistles that make up the heart of the divine revelation in the New Testament. The essential subject of these four books is Christ and the church. Galatians reveals that Christ is versus religion with its law; Ephesians reveals the church as the Body of Christ; Philippians concerns the experience, the living out, of Christ; and Colossians unveils the all-inclusive and all-extensive Christ as the Head of the Body.</note>
        <note num="2">The purpose of this book is to cause its receivers to know that the gospel preached by the apostle Paul was not from man's teaching ([link]vv. 11-12[/link]) but from God's revelation. Hence, in the very opening of this book Paul emphasized that he became an apostle not from men nor through man but through Christ and God.</note>
        <note num="3">The law dealt with man as the old creation, whereas the gospel makes man the new creation in resurrection. God made Paul an apostle not by the law according to his natural man in the old creation but through the resurrection of Christ according to his regenerated man in the new creation. Hence, Paul did not say here, "God the Father, who gave the law through Moses," but "God the Father, who raised Him [Christ] from the dead." God's New Testament economy is not with men in the old creation but with men in the new creation through the resurrection of Christ.</note>

        <note num="1">Lit., pluck us out of, draw us out of, extricate us from.</note>
        <note num="2">An age is a part of the world, which is the satanic system (see note [link]2[sup]1[/sup] in Eph. 2[/link]). According to the context of this book, the present evil age here refers to the religious world, the religious course of the world, the Jewish religion. This is confirmed by [link]6:14-15[/link], where circumcision is considered a part of the world &amp;#8212; the religious world, which to the apostle Paul was crucified. Here the apostle emphasized that the purpose of Christ's giving Himself for our sins was to rescue us, to pluck us, out of the Jewish religion, the present evil age. This is to release God's chosen people from the custody of the law ([link]3:23[/link]), to bring them out of the sheepfold ([link]John 10:1[/link], [link]3[/link]), according to the will of God. Thus, in his opening word Paul indicated what he was going to deal with: he wanted to rescue the churches, which were distracted by Judaism with its law, and bring them back to the grace of the gospel.</note>

        <note num="1">Here Paul came to his subject. Because the churches in Galatia were deserting the grace of Christ and backsliding to the observance of the law, Paul was burdened to write this Epistle.</note>
        <note num="2">Or, by.</note>
        <note num="3">The grace of Christ is the Triune God &amp;#8212; the Father, the Son, and the Spirit &amp;#8212; processed to become our enjoyment. This grace is versus the law of Moses ([link]John 1:17[/link] and note 1).</note>
        <note num="4">This was the Judaic observance of the law. Paul's gospel, which is outside the Judaic law, includes all the major items of the four Gospels. Moreover, it covers many more items so that the revelation of the word of God in the New Testament might be completed ([link]Col. 1:25[/link]) with crucial items such as Christ in the believers as the hope of glory ([link]Col. 1:27[/link]); the Spirit of God as a seal and a pledge ([link]Eph. 1:13-14[/link]); God's Son being revealed in us ([link]v. 16[/link]), being formed in us ([link]4:19[/link]), making His home in us ([link]Eph. 3:17[/link]), and filling us unto all the fullness of God ([link]Eph. 3:19[/link]); and Christ as the mystery of God ([link]Col. 2:2[/link]) and as the One in whom the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily ([link]Col. 2:9[/link]). The focal point of Paul's gospel is that the Son of God, God's anointed One (the Christ), has entered into our being to be our life today ([link]Col. 3:4[/link]) and our glory in the future ([link]Col. 1:27[/link]) that we may be the members ([link]Rom. 12:5[/link]) of the Body of Christ ([link]Eph. 4:16[/link]), of which Christ is the Head ([link]Eph. 4:15[/link]).</note>

        <note num="2">The Son of God, as the embodiment and expression of God the Father ([link]John 1:18[/link]; [link]14:9-11[/link]; [link]Heb. 1:3[/link]), is life to us ([link]John 10:10[/link]; [link]1 John 5:12[/link]; [link]Col. 3:4[/link]). God's heart's desire is to reveal His Son in us that we may know Him, receive Him as our life ([link]John 17:3[/link]; [link]3:16[/link]), and become the sons of God ([link]John 1:12[/link]; [link]Gal. 4:5-6[/link]). As the Son of the living God ([link]Matt. 16:16[/link]), He is far superior to Judaism and its traditions ([link]vv. 13-14[/link]). The Judaizers had bewitched the Galatians into considering that the ordinances of the law were above the Son of the living God. Hence, in the opening of this Epistle the apostle testified that he had been deeply involved and had become far advanced in the realm of Judaism, but that God had rescued him out of that course of the world, which was evil in God's eyes, by revealing His Son in him. In his experience he realized that there was no comparison between the Son of the living God and Judaism with its dead traditions handed down from his forefathers.</note>
        <note num="3">God's revealing of His Son to us is in us; it is not outward but inward, not by an outward vision but by an inward seeing. It is not an objective revelation but a subjective one.[br][br]God made the apostle Paul a minister of Christ by setting him apart, calling him ([link]v. 15[/link]), and revealing His Son in him.</note>
        <note num="4">The apostle Paul did not preach the law but announced Christ, the Son of God, as the gospel; he announced not merely the doctrine concerning Him but the living person Himself.</note>

        <note num="2">Judaism was built upon the God-given law with its three pillars: circumcision, the Sabbath, and the holy dietary regulations. All three were ordained by God ([link]Gen. 17:9-14[/link]; [link]Exo. 20:8-11[/link]; [link]Lev. 11[/link]) as shadows of things to come ([link]Col. 2:16-17[/link]). Circumcision was a shadow of the crucifixion of Christ in its putting off of the flesh, as signified in baptism ([link]Col. 2:11-12[/link]). The Sabbath was a type of Christ as the rest for His people ([link]Matt. 11:28-30[/link]). The holy diet symbolized persons who are clean and persons who are unclean, those whom God's holy people should contact and those they should not contact ([link]Acts 10:11-16[/link], [link]34-35[/link]). Once Christ had come, all these shadows should have been terminated. Hence, the observance of the Sabbath was abolished by the Lord Jesus in His ministry ([link]Matt. 12:1-12[/link]), the holy dietary regulations were annulled by the Spirit in Peter's ministry ([link]Acts 10:9-20[/link]), and circumcision was counted as nothing in the revelation received by Paul in his ministry ([link]5:6[/link]; [link]6:15[/link]). Furthermore, the law, the base of Judaism, has been terminated and replaced by Christ ([link]Rom. 10:4[/link]; [link]Gal. 2:16[/link]). Thus, Judaism in its entirety is finished.</note>

        <note num="1">When the apostles were listed, Peter was usually mentioned first ([link]Matt. 10:2[/link]; [link]Mark 3:16[/link]; [link]Luke 6:14[/link]; [link]Acts 1:13[/link]). Here, however, James was mentioned first. This indicates that at that time Peter was not the foremost leading one in the church; rather, it was James, the brother of the Lord ([link]1:19[/link]). This is confirmed by [link]Acts 15:13-21[/link], where James, not Peter, was the authority who gave the final, decisive word in the conference held in Jerusalem. It must have been because of Peter's weakness in not holding the truth of the gospel, as illustrated by Paul in [link book="Gal." chapter="2"]vv. 11-14[/link], that James came to the forefront to take the lead among the apostles. Hence, both in [link]v. 12[/link] and in [link]Acts 21:18[/link] James was considered the representative of the church in Jerusalem and of the apostles. This is strong proof that Peter was not always the foremost leader in the church. Furthermore, this implies that leadership in the church is not organizational and perpetual; rather, it is spiritual and fluctuates according to the spiritual condition of the leading ones. This strongly rebuts Catholicism in its assertion that Peter was the only successor of Christ in the administration of the church.</note>

        <note num="1">This explains how it is that through law we have died to law. When Christ was crucified, according to God's economy we were included in Him. This is an accomplished fact.</note>
        <note num="2">[i]No longer I[/i] does not indicate an exchanged life, a life in which Christ comes in and we go out, for later in this verse Paul said, "I live." As regenerated people, we have both the old "I," which has been crucified ([link]Rom. 6:6[/link]), concerning which Paul said, "No longer I," and a new "I," concerning which Paul said, "I live." The old, terminated "I" was without divinity; the new "I" has God as life added to it. The new "I" came into being when the old "I" was resurrected and God was added to it. On the one hand, Paul had been terminated, but on the other hand, a resurrected Paul, one who was regenerated with God as his life, still lived. Furthermore, although Paul said, "No longer I," he also said, "It is Christ who lives in me," for it was Christ who lived, but it was in Paul that He lived. The two, Christ and Paul, had one life and one living.</note>
        <note num="3">We have died in Christ through His death, but now He lives in us through His resurrection. His living in us is entirely by His being the life-giving Spirit ([link]1 Cor. 15:45b[/link]). This point is fully developed in all the following chapters, where the Spirit is presented and emphasized as the very One whom we have received as life and in whom we should live.[br][br]The "I," the natural person, inclines to keep the law that it might be perfect ([link]Phil. 3:6[/link]), but God wants us to live Christ that God might be expressed in us through Him ([link]Phil. 1:20-21[/link]). Hence, God's economy is that the "I" be crucified in Christ's death and that Christ live in us in His resurrection. To keep the law is to exalt it above all things in our life; to live Christ is to make Him the center and everything in our life. The law was used by God for a period of time to keep His chosen people in custody for Christ ([link]3:23[/link]) and eventually to conduct them to Christ ([link]3:24[/link]) that they might receive Him as life and live Him to be God's expression. Because Christ has come, the function of the law has been terminated, and Christ must replace the law in our lives for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose.</note>

        <note num="1">The cross is the center of God's operation in His economy. In this Epistle Paul was bringing the believers who had been distracted to the law back to the cross and encouraging them to behold Christ crucified, that they would never again be distracted to the law. This Epistle provides a thorough view of Christ crucified ([link]1:4[/link]; [link]2:19-21[/link]; [link]3:13[/link]; [link]5:24[/link]; [link]6:14[/link]).[br][br]The crucifixion of Christ indicates that all the requirements of the law have been fulfilled by the death of Christ, and that Christ through His death has released His life that it may be imparted into us in His resurrection to free us from bondage under the law. This was fully portrayed before the eyes of the Galatians in the word of the gospel. How could they neglect this and be bewitched, drifting back to the law? How foolish!</note>

        <text>This only I wish to learn from you, Did you [note]1[/note]receive the [note]2[/note][xref]a[/xref]Spirit out of the [note]3[/note][xref]b[/xref]works of law or out of the [note]3[/note][xref]c[/xref]hearing of [xref]d[/xref]faith?</text>
        <note num="1">When the believers believe into Christ, they receive the Spirit. It is a serious misunderstanding to consider Christ as separate from the Spirit. At the time of regeneration we believed into Christ, and we also received the Spirit and were sealed with the Spirit ([link]Eph. 1:13[/link]). At that very moment an organic union took place &amp;#8212; we were grafted into the Triune God ([link]Rom. 11:17[/link]), and the Spirit as the pledge ([link]Eph. 1:14[/link]) became the ultimate blessing of the gospel to us ([link]v. 14[/link]). After this, receiving the Spirit is a lifelong, continuous matter. God is supplying the Spirit to us continuously ([link]v. 5[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">The Galatians, through the hearing of the gospel, believed in the crucified Christ, but they received the Spirit. The One who was crucified on the cross was Christ, but the One who entered into the believers was the Spirit. In His being crucified for the believers' redemption He was Christ, but in His indwelling the believers to be their life He is the Spirit. This is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, who is the all-inclusive and ultimate blessing of the gospel. The believers receive such a divine Spirit by the hearing of faith, not by the works of law. He enters into the believers and lives in them not by their keeping of the law but by their faith in the crucified and resurrected Christ.[br][br]In the first two chapters of this Epistle there is Christ in the divine revelation as the focal point of God's economy, but in the last four chapters there is the Spirit in our experience for us to have the divine life ([link]ch. 3[/link]), to be born of God ([link]ch. 4[/link]), to live and walk by the regenerated life ([link]ch. 5[/link]), and to take the divine purpose as our goal ([link]ch. 6[/link]). Thus, we enjoy Christ continually as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit ([link]v. 5a[/link]).</note>
        <note num="3">The law was the basic condition for the relationship between man and God in God's Old Testament economy ([link]v. 23[/link]); faith is the unique way for God to carry out His New Testament economy with man ([link]1 Tim. 1:4[/link]). The law is related to the flesh ([link]Rom. 7:5[/link]) and depends on the effort of the flesh, the very flesh that is the expression of the "I." Faith is related to the Spirit and trusts in the operation of the Spirit, the very Spirit who is the realization of Christ. In the Old Testament the "I" and the flesh played an important role in the keeping of the law. In the New Testament Christ and the Spirit take over the position of the "I" and the flesh, and faith replaces the law, that we may live Christ by the Spirit. To keep the law by the flesh is man's natural way; it is in the darkness of man's concept and results in death and wretchedness ([link]Rom. 7:10-11[/link], [link]24[/link]). To receive the Spirit out of the hearing of faith is God's revealed way; it is in the light of God's revelation and issues in life and glory ([link]Rom. 8:2[/link], [link]6[/link], [link]10-11[/link], [link]30[/link]). Hence, we must treasure the hearing of faith, not the works of law. It is by the hearing of faith that we received the Spirit so that we might participate in God's promised blessing and live Christ. The faith mentioned in [link]vv. 7[/link], [link]8[/link], [link]9[/link], [link]11[/link], [link]12[/link], [link]23[/link], [link]24[/link], and [link]25[/link] of this chapter is this faith.

We should not begin by the Spirit and attempt to be perfected by the flesh. Since we have begun by the Spirit, we should be perfected by the Spirit and have nothing to do with the flesh. In [link]2:20[/link] the contrast is between Christ and the "I"; here the contrast is between the Spirit and the flesh. This indicates that the Spirit is Christ and the flesh is the "I" in our experience. From [link]ch. 3[/link] to the end of the Epistle, the Spirit is Christ in our life experience. In revelation, it is Christ; in experience, it is the Spirit.[br][br]The flesh is condemned and repudiated throughout this book ([link]1:16[/link]; [link]2:16[/link]; [link]3:3[/link]; [link]4:23[/link], [link]29[/link]; [link]5:13[/link], [link]16-17[/link], [link]19[/link], [link]24[/link]; [link]6:8[/link], [link]12-13[/link]), and from [link]ch. 3[/link] every chapter gives a contrast between the flesh and the Spirit ([link]v. 3[/link]; [link]4:29[/link]; [link]5:16-17[/link], [link]19[/link], [link]22[/link]; [link]6:8[/link]). The flesh is the uttermost expression of the fallen tripartite man, and the Spirit is the ultimate realization of the processed Triune God. The flesh inclines to keep the law and is tested by the law; the Spirit is received and enjoyed out of faith. God's economy delivers us from the flesh to the Spirit that we may participate in the blessing of the riches of the Triune God. This cannot take place by the flesh keeping the law but by the Spirit being received out of faith and experienced through faith.</note>

        <note num="1">The blessing promised by God to Abraham ([link]Gen. 12:3[/link]) for all the nations of the earth. The promise was fulfilled, and the blessing has come to the nations in Christ through His redemption by the cross.</note>
        <note num="2">In the gospel we have received not only the blessing of forgiveness, washing, and cleansing; even more, we have received the greatest blessing, which is the Triune God &amp;#8212; the Father, Son, and Spirit &amp;#8212; as the processed, all-inclusive life-giving Spirit dwelling in us in a most subjective way for our enjoyment. Oh, what a blessing that we can enjoy such an all-inclusive One as our daily portion!</note>
        <note num="3">This verse indicates that the Spirit is the blessing that God promised to Abraham for all the nations and that has been received by the believers through faith in Christ. The Spirit is the compound Spirit, as mentioned in note [link]5[sup]2[/sup][/link], and actually is God Himself processed in His Trinity through incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and descension that we may receive Him as our life and our everything. This is the focus of the gospel of God.[br][br]The physical aspect of the blessing that God promised to Abraham was the good land ([link]Gen. 12:7[/link]; [link]13:15[/link]; [link]17:8[/link]; [link]26:3-4[/link]), which was a type of the all-inclusive Christ (see [link]Col. 1:12[/link] and note 2). Since Christ is eventually realized as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit ([link]1 Cor. 15:45[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 3:17[/link]), the blessing of the promised Spirit corresponds with the blessing of the land promised to Abraham. Actually, the Spirit as the realization of Christ in our experience is the good land as the source of God's bountiful supply for us to enjoy.</note>

He is not only the seed who inherits the promises but also the blessing of the promises to be inherited by us. For the Galatian believers to turn back from Christ to the law meant that they would forfeit both the Heir and the inheritance of the promises.</note>

        <note num="1">This indicates that the promise God gave to Abraham became a covenant, which is more firm than a promise. The word, the promise, and the covenant are the gospel that was preached to Abraham. The gospel is the covenant, the covenant is the promise, and the promise is the word spoken by God. Although the gospel is a matter of the new testament, it is important to realize that the new testament is a continuation, or repetition, of God's promise to Abraham.</note>
        <note num="2">God's promise to Abraham was given first. The law came 430 years later. The promise was permanent, but the law was temporary.

        <note num="1">Abraham has only one seed, Christ ([link]v. 16[/link]). Hence, to be Abraham's seed we must be of Christ, be a part of Christ. Because we are one with Christ, we too are Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise, inheriting God's promised blessing, which is the all-inclusive Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed God, who is our portion. Under the new testament, the believers as God's chosen people, being sons of full age, are such heirs, not under law but in Christ. Like Ishmael ([link]4:23[/link]), the Judaizers, who remained under law and kept themselves apart from Christ, were Abraham's descendants according to the flesh; they were not like Isaac ([link]4:28[/link]), who was Abraham's heir according to promise. But the believers in Christ are such heirs, inheriting the promised blessing. Hence, we should remain in Christ and not turn to the law.[br][br]Since the law is unable to give us life ([link]v. 21[/link]), it cannot produce the sons of God; but the Spirit, who is received out of faith ([link]v. 2[/link]) and who gives us life ([link]2 Cor. 3:6[/link]), can. The law kept God's chosen people under its custody until faith came ([link]v. 23[/link]). Faith in Christ, who is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, makes God's chosen people Abraham's seed as "the stars of the heavens" ([link]Gen. 22:17[/link]) according to God's promise.</note>
        <note num="2">This chapter reveals that God gave the promise to Abraham according to His eternal purpose. Before this promise was fulfilled, the law was given to serve as the custodian of God's chosen people. Then, at the appointed time Christ, the promised seed, came to fulfill the promise and brought in the promised blessing. This is grace. Hence, grace came with Christ and with the fulfillment of the promise. All this is on God's side. On our side, we need a way to apprehend, realize, and enjoy all that Christ, the seed, is and has accomplished. Therefore, there is grace on God's side, and there is faith on our side. Now, since we have grace, faith, and the seed that has fulfilled the promise, we no longer need the law to serve as our custodian. Hence, we must set aside the law and turn from the custodian to stay with Christ that we may enjoy the promised blessing by remaining in grace and faith. This blessing is nothing less than the processed Triune God as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</note>

        <text>That He might [note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]redeem those under law that we might receive the [note]2[/note][xref]b[/xref]sonship.</text>
        <note num="1">God's chosen people were shut up by the law under its custody ([link]3:23[/link]). Christ was born under law in order to redeem God's chosen people from the custody of the law that they might receive the sonship and become the sons of God. Hence, they should not return to the custody of the law to be under its slavery, as the Galatians were seduced to do, but should remain in the sonship of God to enjoy the life supply of the Spirit in Christ.</note>
        <note num="2">Christ's redemption brings us into the sonship of God that we may enjoy the divine life. God's economy is not to make us keepers of the law, obeying the commandments and ordinances of the law, which was given only for a temporary purpose. God's economy is to make us sons of God, who inherit the blessing of God's promise, which was given for His eternal purpose. God's eternal purpose is to have many sons for His corporate expression ([link]Heb. 2:10[/link]; [link]Rom. 8:29[/link]). Hence, He predestinated us unto sonship ([link]Eph. 1:5[/link]) and regenerated us to be His sons ([link]John 1:12-13[/link]). We should remain in His sonship that we may become His heirs to inherit all that He has planned for His eternal expression, and should not appreciate the law and thereby be distracted to Judaism.</note>

        <text>And because you are [xref]a[/xref]sons, God has [xref]b[/xref]sent forth the [note]1[/note][xref]c[/xref]Spirit of His Son into our [note]2[/note]hearts, [note]3[/note]crying, [note]4[/note][xref]d[/xref]Abba, Father!</text>
        <note num="1">God's Son is the embodiment of the divine life ([link]1 John 5:12[/link]). Hence, the Spirit of God's Son is the Spirit of life ([link]Rom. 8:2[/link]). God gives us His Spirit of life not because we are law keepers but because we are His sons. As law keepers, we have no right to enjoy God's Spirit of life; as the sons of God, we have the position with the full right to participate in the Spirit of God, who has the bountiful supply of life. Such a Spirit, the Spirit of the Son of God, is the focus of the blessing of God's promise to Abraham ([link]3:14[/link]).[br][br][link]Verses 4-6[/link] of this chapter speak of the Triune God's producing of many sons for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose. God the Father sent forth God the Son to redeem us from the law that we might receive the sonship. He also sent forth God the Spirit to impart His life into us that we might become His sons in reality.</note>
        <note num="2">Actually, the Spirit of God came into our spirit at the time of our regeneration ([link]John 3:6[/link]; [link]Rom. 8:16[/link]). Because our spirit is hidden in our heart ([link]1 Pet. 3:4[/link]), and because the word here refers to a matter that is related to our feeling and understanding, both of which belong to our heart, this verse says that the Spirit of God's Son was sent into our hearts.</note>
        <note num="3">The parallel verse, [link]Rom. 8:15[/link], says that we who have received a spirit of sonship cry in this spirit, "Abba, Father!" whereas here it says that the Spirit of God's Son is crying in our hearts, "Abba, Father!" This indicates that our regenerated spirit and the Spirit of God are mingled as one, and that our spirit is in our heart. This indicates also that the sonship of God is realized by us through our subjective experience in the depth of our being. In this verse, Paul appealed to such an experience of the Galatian believers for the supporting of his revelation. This appeal was quite convincing and subduing because it contained not only objective doctrines but also subjective, experiential facts.</note>
        <note num="4">[i]Abba[/i] is an Aramaic word, and [i]Father[/i] is the translation of the Greek word [i]Pater.[/i] Such a term was used first by the Lord Jesus in Gethsemane while He was praying to the Father ([link]Mark 14:36[/link]). The combining of the Aramaic title with the Greek title expresses a stronger affection in crying to the Father. Such an affectionate cry implies an intimate relationship in life between a genuine son and a begetting father.</note>

        <note num="2">Painful toil in childbirth. In this metaphor Paul likened himself to a mother who gives birth to a child. He had labored in this way to regenerate the Galatians when he first preached the gospel to them. Because they deviated from the gospel that he had preached to them, he was toiling again in travail until Christ would be formed in them.</note>
        <note num="3">Christ, a living person, is the focus of Paul's gospel. Paul's preaching, which differed greatly from the teaching of the law in letters, was to bring forth Christ, the Son of the living God, in the believers. Hence, this book is emphatically Christ-centered. Christ was crucified ([link]3:1[/link]) to redeem us out of the curse of the law ([link]3:13[/link]) and rescue us out of the evil religious course of the world ([link]1:4[/link]), and He was resurrected from the dead ([link]1:1[/link]) that He might live in us ([link]2:20[/link]). We were baptized into Him, being identified with Him, and have put Him on, clothing ourselves with Him ([link]3:27[/link]). Thus, we are in Him ([link]3:28[/link]) and have become of Him ([link]3:29[/link]; [link]5:24[/link]). On the other hand, He has been revealed in us ([link]1:16[/link]), He is now living in us ([link]2:20[/link]), and He will be formed in us ([link]v. 19[/link]). To Him the law has conducted us ([link]3:24[/link]), and in Him we are all sons of God ([link]3:26[/link]). It is in Him that we inherit God's promised blessing and enjoy the all-inclusive Spirit ([link]3:14[/link]). Furthermore, it is in Him that we are all one ([link]3:28[/link]). We should not be deprived of all profit from Him and thus be severed from Him ([link]5:4[/link]). We need Him to supply us with His grace in our spirit ([link]6:18[/link]) that we may live Him.</note>
        <note num="4">When the Galatian believers were regenerated through Paul's preaching of the gospel to them the first time, Christ was born into them but not formed in them. Here the apostle was travailing again that Christ might be formed in them. To have Christ formed in us is to have Christ fully grown in us. First, Christ was born into us at the time we repented and believed in Him, then He lives in us in our Christian life ([link]2:20[/link]), and, finally, He will be formed in us at our maturity. Christ's being formed in us is needed that we may be sons of full age and heirs to inherit God's promised blessing, and that we may mature in the divine sonship.</note>

The apostle wanted the Galatians to know that they were children of the Jerusalem above, children of the free woman, and he wanted them to appropriate the covenant of promise and, according to the Spirit, enjoy the all-inclusive Spirit as the blessing of the gospel ([link]3:14[/link]). In this section Sarah, the free woman, symbolizes the covenant of promise, which is symbolized also by the Jerusalem above, who is our mother; the mother symbolizes grace, by which we are born to be the children of God, who is the very source of grace. Hence, the free woman, the covenant of promise, the Jerusalem above, and the mother all refer to God's grace, which is the very means of our spiritual birth.

Like Hagar, the law brought forth children unto slavery, such as the Judaizers. Like Sarah, grace brings forth children unto sonship; these are the New Testament believers. They are no longer under law but under grace ([link]Rom. 6:14[/link]). They should stand in grace ([link]Rom. 5:2[/link]) and not fall from it ([link]5:4[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">The flesh is the expression of the old Adam. The fallen life of the old Adam is expressed practically in the flesh, and the works of the flesh, such as those listed in [link]vv. 19-21[/link], are different aspects of such a fleshly expression. Fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, bouts of drunkenness, and carousings are related to the lust of the corrupted body. Enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, divisions, sects, and envyings are related to the fallen soul, which is very closely related to the corrupted body. Idolatry and sorcery are related to the deadened spirit. This proves that the three parts of our fallen being &amp;#8212; body, soul, and spirit &amp;#8212; are all involved with the corrupted, evil flesh.</note>

Only nine items of the fruit of the Spirit, as different expressions of the Spirit, who is life within us, are listed as illustrations here. The fruit of the Spirit includes additional items, such as lowliness ([link]Eph. 4:2[/link]; [link]Phil. 2:3[/link]), compassion ([link]Phil. 2:1[/link]), godliness ([link]2 Pet. 1:6[/link]), righteousness ([link]Rom. 14:17[/link]; [link]Eph. 5:9[/link]), holiness ([link]Eph. 1:4[/link]; [link]Col. 1:22[/link]), and purity ([link]Matt. 5:8[/link]). In both [link]Eph. 4:2[/link] and [link]Col. 3:12[/link], lowliness is mentioned as a virtue in addition to meekness, which is listed here. In [link]Rom. 14:17[/link] righteousness, peace, and joy are all aspects of the kingdom of God today. But only peace and joy, not righteousness, are listed here. In [link]2 Pet. 1:5-7[/link] godliness and endurance are counted with self-control and love as characteristics of spiritual growth, but they are not listed here. In [link]Matt. 5:5-9[/link] righteousness, mercy, and purity are reckoned with meekness and peace as the requirement of the reality of the kingdom today. However, none of the three virtues is named here.[br][br]As the flesh is the expression of the old Adam, so the Spirit is the realization of Christ. Christ is actually lived out as the Spirit. The items of the fruit of the Spirit listed here are the very characteristics of Christ.</note>

        <note num="2">The crucifixion of the old man in [link]Rom. 6:6[/link] and the crucifixion of the "I" in [link]Gal. 2:20[/link] were not accomplished by us. But here it says that we have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts. The old man and the "I" are our being; the flesh is the expression of our being in our practical living. The crucifixion of our old man and the "I" is a fact accomplished by Christ on the cross, whereas the crucifying of our flesh with its passions and its lusts is our practical experience of the fact. This practical experience must be carried out through the Spirit by our executing of the crucifixion that Christ accomplished. This is to put to death by the Spirit the practices of our lustful body with its evil members ([link]Rom. 8:13b[/link]; [link]Col. 3:5[/link]).[br][br]There are three aspects of the experience of the cross: (1) the fact accomplished by Christ ([link]Rom. 6:6[/link]; [link]Gal. 2:20[/link]); (2) our application of the accomplished fact ([link]v. 24[/link]); and (3) our experience of what we have applied, by bearing the cross daily ([link]Matt. 16:24[/link]; [link]Luke 9:23[/link]).</note>
        <note num="3">This book unveils that the law misused is in opposition to Christ ([link]2:16[/link]) and that the flesh lusts against the Spirit ([link]v. 17[/link]). The cross has nullified the "I," which inclines to keep the law ([link]2:20[/link]), and the flesh, which lusts against the Spirit, that Christ may replace the law and the Spirit may replace the flesh. God does not want us to keep the law by the flesh; He wants us to live Christ by the Spirit.</note>

Such a walk is cultivated by living in the new creation ([link]6:16[/link] and note 2), by pursuing Christ in order to gain Him ([link]Phil. 3:12[/link] and notes), and by practicing the church life ([link]Rom. 12:1-5[/link]; [link]Eph. 4:1-16[/link]), thus fulfilling God's intention in Christ for the church.</note>

        <note num="1">The old creation is our old man in Adam ([link]Eph. 4:22[/link]), our natural being by birth, without God's life and the divine nature. The new creation is the new man in Christ ([link]Eph. 4:24[/link]), our being that is regenerated by the Spirit ([link]John 3:6[/link]), having God's life and the divine nature wrought into it ([link]John 3:36[/link]; [link]2 Pet. 1:4[/link]), having Christ as its constituent ([link]Col. 3:10-11[/link]), and having become a new constitution. This refers to the nature, the inward and intrinsic organic constituent, of the church. Thus, the new creation is composed of sons; it is a corporate, divine sonship ([link]3:26[/link]; [link]4:5[/link], [link]7[/link]) brought forth through Christ's redemption, the Spirit's regeneration, and God's dispensing of Himself into us, and through our entering collectively as this new man into an organic union with the Triune God.[br][br]The old creation was old because it did not have God's element; the new creation is new because it has God as its element. Although we are still the old creation, we experience the reality of the new creation when we walk according to the Spirit ([link]5:16[/link], [link]25[/link]). The main issue in this book is that we are the new creation and that we should live by the new creation through an organic union with the Triune God. This new creation fulfills God's eternal purpose, which is to express Himself in His sonship.[br][br]Circumcision is an ordinance of the law; the new creation is the masterpiece of life with the divine nature. The former is of dead letters; the latter is of the living Spirit. Hence, the new creation is what matters. This book exposes the impotence of both the law and circumcision. The law cannot impart life ([link]3:21[/link]) to regenerate us, and circumcision cannot energize us ([link]5:6[/link]) to live a new creation. But the Son of God, who has been revealed in us ([link]1:16[/link]), can enliven us and make us a new creation, and Christ, who lives in us ([link]2:20[/link]), can afford us the riches of His life that we may live the new creation. The law has been replaced by Christ ([link]2:19-20[/link]), and circumcision has been fulfilled by Christ's crucifixion ([link]v. 14[/link]). Hence, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is anything, but a new creation with Christ as its life is what matters. To be the new creation is the reason for and result of sowing unto the Spirit ([link]v. 8[/link]). The keeping of the law and the practicing of circumcision are a sowing unto the flesh; they do not change the old creation. But sowing unto the Spirit makes us a new creation, which is re-created by the Spirit, transformed by the divine life, and constituted with the rich element of the processed Triune God by His mingling of Himself with us.</note>

Peace is the condition that results from grace. As we abide in a peaceful condition, we need to continue receiving mercy and grace.</note>

        <note num="1">The marks branded on slaves to indicate their owners. With Paul, a slave of Christ ([link]Rom. 1:1[/link]), the brands were physically the scars of his wounds received in his faithful service to his Master ([link]2 Cor. 11:23-27[/link]). Spiritually, they signify the characteristics of the life that he lived, a life like the one the Lord Jesus lived on this earth. Such a life is continually crucified ([link]John 12:24[/link]), does the will of God ([link]John 6:38[/link]), does not seek its own glory but the glory of God ([link]John 7:18[/link]), and is submissive and obedient to God, even unto the death of the cross ([link]Phil. 2:8[/link]). The apostle followed the pattern of the Lord Jesus, bearing the brands, the characteristics of His life. In this he was absolutely different from the Judaizers.</note>

        <note num="1">The grace of Jesus Christ is the bountiful supply of the Triune God (who is embodied in the Son and realized as the life-giving Spirit) enjoyed by us through the exercise of our human spirit.</note>
        <note num="2">Our regenerated spirit indwelt by the Spirit, who is the focus of God's promised blessing stressed so much throughout this book. It is in this spirit of ours that we experience and enjoy the Spirit as the central blessing of the New Testament. Hence, we need the grace of the Lord, which is the bountiful supply of the all-inclusive Spirit ([link]Phil. 1:19[/link]), to be with our spirit.[br][br]Christ, the Spirit, the new creation, and our spirit are the four basic items revealed in this book as the underlying thought of God's economy. Christ is the center of God's economy, and the Spirit is the reality of Christ. When Christ is realized through the Spirit in our spirit, we become the new creation. Hence, our spirit is vital for us to live the life of the new creation for the fulfilling of God's purpose.[br][br]This book places strong emphasis on the cross and the experience of crucifixion, in order to deal with the negative items, such as the law, the flesh, the "I," the religious world, slavery, and the curse, thereby bringing in the positive items that are revealed in this book: Christ, the Spirit, the sons of God, the heirs of promise, the household of the faith, the new creation, and the Israel of God. The summarizing thought in this book is that through the cross of Christ the law, the flesh, and religion are terminated that we may obtain the Spirit, the new creation, and our spirit, that through the Spirit, who is the realization of Christ, we may be the new creation in our spirit, bearing the brands of Jesus, and that we may enjoy the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ in our spirit.</note>

At the close of such a severe, rebuking, and warning Epistle, the apostle used this loving term again, placing it particularly at the end of the sentence, to express his unchanging love toward them, assuring them that they were still his brothers in the household of the faith ([link]v. 10[/link]).</note>
