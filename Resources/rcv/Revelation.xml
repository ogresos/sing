        <text>The [note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to Him to [xref]b[/xref]show to His [xref]c[/xref]slaves the things that must quickly take place; and He made [i]it[/i] known by [note]2[/note][xref]d[/xref]signs, sending [i]it[/i] by His [xref]e[/xref]angel to His slave John,</text>
        <note num="1">As the last book of the Bible, Revelation is the conclusion, completion, and consummation of the entire divine revelation, the whole Bible. The seeds of most of the truths of the divine revelation were sown in Genesis, the first book of the Bible. The growth of all these seeds is progressively developed in the succeeding books, especially in the books of the New Testament, and the harvest is reaped in the book of Revelation. Hence, most of the things covered in this book are not absolutely new but are in the preceding books and are perfected in this book, the focus of which is the unique, ultimate revelation of Christ, the particular, consummate testimony of Jesus, and the universal, eternal economy of God.[br][br]This book is a book of prophecy &amp;#8212; not prophecy merely in words but in visions revealed to the seer. In the eyes of God, all the things prophesied in this book have already taken place. Thus, all were shown to the seer, vision after vision. Therefore, most of the verbs used in this book are in the past tense.[br][br]The whole Bible reveals Christ; the book of Revelation especially, as the conclusion, completion, and consummation of the whole Bible, is "the revelation of Jesus Christ." Although this book also reveals many other things, the focus of its revelation is Christ. Several aspects concerning Christ, such as the vision of Christ as the High Priest in the midst of the churches, caring for them in love yet with a judging attitude ([link]vv. 13-16[/link]), the vision of Him as the Lion-Lamb in the midst of God's throne and of the four living creatures and in the midst of the twenty-four elders of the universe, opening the seven seals of God's universal administration ([link]5:1-6:1[/link]), and the vision of Him as "another strong Angel" coming down out of heaven to take possession of the earth ([link]10:1-8[/link]; [link]18:1[/link]), etc., were never unveiled as they are in this book.</note>
        <note num="2">The revelation of this book is composed mainly of signs, i.e., symbols with spiritual significance, such as the seven lampstands, signifying the churches; the seven stars, signifying the messengers of the churches ([link]v. 20[/link]), etc. Even the New Jerusalem is a sign, signifying the ultimate consummation of God's economy ([link]chs. 21-22[/link]). This book, then, is a book of signs through which the revelation is made known to us.[br][br]John's Gospel is a book of signs signifying how Christ came to be our life to produce the church, His bride. John's Revelation is a book of signs showing how Christ is now caring for the church and how He is coming to judge and possess the earth and bring the church, His bride, into God's full economy.</note>

        <note num="1">Seven is the number for completion in God's operation &amp;#8212; e.g., the seven days for God's creation ([link]Gen. 1:31-2:3[/link]) and the seven seals ([link]5:5[/link]), seven trumpets ([link]8:2[/link]), and seven bowls ([link]15:7[/link]) for God's move on the earth. Hence, the seven churches are for God's move in completion.</note>
        <note num="2">Asia was a province of the ancient Roman Empire, and in that province were the seven cities mentioned in [link]v. 11[/link]. The seven churches were in those seven cities, respectively; they were not all in one city. This book does not deal with the one universal church but with the local churches in many cities. First, in [link]Matt. 16:18[/link] the church is revealed as universal, and then in [link]Matt. 18:17[/link] it is revealed as local. In Acts the church was practiced in the way of local churches, such as the church in Jerusalem ([link]Acts 8:1[/link]), the church in Antioch ([link]Acts 13:1[/link]), the church in Ephesus ([link]Acts 20:17[/link]), and the churches in the provinces of Syria and Cilicia ([link]Acts 15:41[/link]). The Epistles were written to the local churches, except for a few written to individuals. Not one was written to the universal church. Without the local churches, the universal church has no practicality or actuality. The universal church is realized in the local churches. Knowing the church in its universal aspect must be consummated in knowing the church in its local aspect. It is a great advance for us to know and practice the local churches. Concerning the church, the book of Revelation is in the advanced stage. To know this book, we must advance from the understanding of the universal church to the realization and practice of the local churches, because this book is written to the local churches. Only those who are in the local churches are positioned rightly, with the right angle and the proper perspective, to see the visions in this book.[br][br]The Triune God is expressed in Christ ([link]John 1:1[/link], [link]14[/link]; [link]1 Tim. 3:16[/link]; [link]Col. 2:9[/link]); Christ is realized and experienced as the Spirit ([link]John 14:16-18[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 15:45[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 3:17[/link]; [link]Rom. 8:9[/link]; [link]Phil. 1:19[/link]) and is expressed in His Body, the universal church ([link]Eph. 1:22-23[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 12:12[/link]; [link]Eph. 4:4[/link]); and the universal church is expressed in the local churches. Therefore, to know and experience God, we need to know and experience Christ; to know and experience Christ, we need to participate in the universal church through the Spirit; and to participate in the universal church, we need to participate in the local churches.</note>
        <note num="3">He who is and who was and who is coming is God the eternal Father. The seven Spirits who are before God's throne are the operating Spirit of God, God the Spirit. Jesus Christ, to God the faithful Witness, to the church the Firstborn of the dead, and to the world the Ruler of the kings of the earth ([link]v. 5[/link]), is God the Son. This is the Triune God. As God the eternal Father, He was in the past, He is in the present, and He is coming in the future. As God the Spirit, He is the sevenfold intensified Spirit for God's operation (see note 5). As God the Son, He is (1) the Witness, the testimony, the expression of God; (2) the Firstborn of the dead for the church, the new creation; and (3) the Ruler of the kings of the earth for the world. From such a Triune God, grace and peace are imparted to the churches.</note>
        <note num="4">[i]Him[/i]...who is coming may imply Christ's coming again, indicating that to His creatures, especially His redeemed, what the Triune God is will be more real at that time than in the past or in the present.</note>
        <note num="5">The seven Spirits are undoubtedly the Spirit of God because They are ranked among the Triune God in [link]vv. 4[/link] and [link]5[/link]. As seven is the number for completion in God's operation, so the seven Spirits must be for God's move on the earth. In essence and existence, God's Spirit is one; in the intensified function and work of God's operation, God's Spirit is sevenfold. This is similar to the lampstand in [link]Zech. 4:2[/link]. In its existence it is one lampstand, but in its function it is seven lamps. At the time this book was written, the church had become degraded; the age was dark. Therefore, the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God was needed for God's move and work on the earth.[br][br]In [link]Matt. 28:19[/link] the sequence of the Triune God is: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Here the sequence is changed. The seven Spirits of God are listed in the second place instead of the third. This reveals the importance of the intensified function of the sevenfold Spirit of God. This point is confirmed by the repeated emphasis on the Spirit's speaking in [link]2:7[/link], [link]11[/link], [link]17[/link], [link]29[/link]; [link]3:6[/link], [link]13[/link], [link]22[/link]; [link]14:13[/link]; [link]22:17[/link].[br][br]At the opening of the other Epistles, only the Father and the Son are mentioned; from Them grace and peace are given to the receivers. Here, however, the Spirit is included; from Him grace and peace are imparted to the churches. This too indicates the crucial need of the Spirit to counteract the degradation of the church for God's move.</note>

        <note num="1">The believers, redeemed by the blood of Christ, not only have been born of God into His kingdom ([link]John 3:5[/link]) but also have been made a kingdom for God's economy. This kingdom is the church ([link]Matt. 16:18-19[/link]). John, the writer of the book, was in this kingdom ([link]v. 9[/link]), and all redeemed and reborn believers also are a part of this kingdom ([link]Rom. 14:17[/link]).[br][br]One of the main aspects of this book is that God is recovering His right over the earth in order to make the whole earth His kingdom ([link]11:15[/link]). When Christ came, He brought the kingdom of God with Him ([link]Luke 17:21[/link]; [link]Matt. 12:28[/link]). This kingdom has been enlarged into the church ([link]Matt. 16:18-19[/link]), which will accomplish the establishing of the kingdom of God on the whole earth. On one hand, the kingdom of God today is in the church, but on the other hand, the kingdom of God is coming through the overcoming believers ([link]12:10[/link]). Then Christ and the overcoming believers will reign over all the nations in the millennial kingdom ([link]2:26-27[/link]; [link]12:5[/link]; [link]20:4[/link], [link]6[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">The redemption accomplished through Christ's blood made us not only a kingdom to God but also priests to God ([link]1 Pet. 2:5[/link]). The kingdom is for God's dominion, whereas priests are for the expression of God's image. This is the kingly, royal priesthood ([link]1 Pet. 2:9[/link]), which is for the fulfillment of God's original purpose in creating man ([link]Gen. 1:26-28[/link]). This kingly priesthood is being exercised in today's church life ([link]5:10[/link]). It will be practiced intensively in the millennial kingdom ([link]20:6[/link]) and will be ultimately consummated in the New Jerusalem ([link]22:3[/link], [link]5[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">This book stresses not only the Spirit of God as the sevenfold intensified Spirit for God's intensified move, but also our human spirit as the organ for us to realize and respond to God's move. Only spirit (our spirit) can respond to Spirit (God's Spirit). This book is composed of four major visions: (1) the vision of the churches ([link]chs. 1-3[/link]), (2) the vision of the destiny of the world ([link]chs. 4-16[/link]), (3) the vision of Babylon the Great ([link]chs. 17-20[/link]), and (4) the vision of the New Jerusalem ([link]chs. 21-22[/link]). John was in his spirit when he saw these four visions ([link]v. 10[/link]; [link]4:2[/link]; [link]17:3[/link]; [link]21:10[/link]); that is, he received the revelation of the mystery of Christ in his spirit, according to what is mentioned in [link]Eph. 3:5[/link]. We too need to be in our spirit to see the visions in this book. It is a matter not merely of mental understanding in our mind but of spiritual realization in our spirit.</note>

        <note num="1">This book's being sent to the seven churches equals its being sent to the seven cities. This shows clearly that the practice of the church life in the early days was the practice of having one church for one city, one city with only one church. In no city was there more than one church. This is the local church, with the city, not the street or the area, as the unit. The jurisdiction of a local church should cover the whole city in which the church is located; it should not be greater or lesser than the boundary of the city. All the believers within that boundary should constitute the one unique local church within that city.</note>

        <note num="1">To see anything requires the right position with the right angle. First, the apostle John heard the voice ([link]v. 10[/link]), and then, when he turned to see the voice, he saw the golden lampstands. He was rightly positioned, but he still needed the right angle to see the vision concerning the churches; so he turned. It is the same with us today. Many Christians need to be adjusted in their position and to be turned that they may see the vision of the churches.</note>
        <note num="2">In figure, gold signifies the divine nature. Here the lampstands are golden, signifying that the churches are constituted with the divine nature.</note>
        <note num="3">In the Bible the lampstand is always related to God's building. The first time the lampstand was mentioned was in [link]Exo. 25:31-40[/link], when the tabernacle was built. The second instance was in regard to the building of the temple in [link]1 Kings 7:49[/link]. The third instance was closely related to the rebuilding of God's temple in [link]Zech. 4:2-10[/link]. Here in Revelation the lampstand is related to the building of the churches. In [link]Exo. 25[/link] the emphasis is on Christ being the lampstand as the divine light, shining as seven lamps with the Spirit (the oil). In [link]Zech. 4[/link] the emphasis is on the Spirit ([link]Zech. 4:6[/link]) as seven lamps shining, these seven lamps being the seven eyes of God ([link]Zech. 4:2[/link], [link]10[/link]). The seven eyes of God are the seven Spirits of God ([link]Rev. 5:6[/link]) for God's intensified move. This indicates that the lampstand in Zechariah is the reality of the lampstand in Exodus, and that the lampstands in Revelation are the reproduction of the lampstand in Zechariah. Christ is realized as the Spirit, and the Spirit is expressed as the churches. The shining Spirit is the reality of the shining Christ, and the shining churches are the reproduction and expression of the shining Spirit to accomplish God's eternal purpose that the New Jerusalem as the shining city may be consummated. Christ, the Spirit, and the churches are all of the same divine nature.</note>

        <text>And [note]1[/note]in the [xref]a[/xref]midst of the lampstands One like the [note]2[/note][xref]b[/xref]Son of Man, clothed with a [note]3[/note][xref]c[/xref]garment reaching to the feet, and [note]4[/note][xref]d[/xref]girded about at the breasts with a golden [xref]e[/xref]girdle.</text>
        <note num="1">Christ today is in the midst of the churches. On one hand, as the High Priest, He is interceding in the heavens for the churches ([link]Heb. 9:24[/link]; [link]7:25-26[/link]; [link]Rom. 8:34[/link]), and on the other hand, He is walking in the midst of the churches to care for them. To participate in His move and enjoy His care, we must be in the churches.</note>
        <note num="2">Christ not only is depicted here as the High Priest, as shown by His garment, but also is unveiled as being like the Son of Man. He is both divine and human. As our High Priest, He is caring for the churches in His humanity.[br][br]Christ as the Son of Man is not only for the accomplishing of redemption but also for the church life, because the church is composed of human beings. That the Lord is still the Son of Man after His ascension indicates that He has not put off His human nature after resurrection. His dealings here with the churches are based on His humanity. In His humanity He was altogether victorious and successful in bearing the testimony of God. The churches also, being in humanity, surely can be victorious and successful in bearing the testimony of God.</note>
        <note num="3">The garment reaching to the feet is the priestly robe ([link]Exo. 28:33-35[/link]) and signifies the fullness of Christ's divine attributes and human virtues (cf. [link]Isa. 6:1[/link], [link]3[/link]).</note>
        <note num="4">The priests in the Old Testament were girded at the loins for their ministry ([link]Exo. 28:4[/link]). In [link]Dan. 10:5[/link] Christ also is girded at His loins, with fine gold. But here Christ as our High Priest is girded about at the breasts. The breasts signify love. To be girded at the loins is to be strengthened for the work, whereas to be girded about at the breasts signifies care in love. Christ's work in producing the churches has been accomplished. He no longer needs to be girded at His loins for the work. What He is doing now in the midst of the churches is to care for them in love. This requires that He be girded about at the breasts with a golden girdle. The golden girdle signifies the divine strength. Christ is moving in the churches to care for them in His humanity and with His divine strength.</note>

        <text>And His head and [note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]hair were as white as [note]2[/note][xref]b[/xref]white wool, as [note]2[/note]snow; and His [note]3[/note][xref]c[/xref]eyes were like a flame of [note]4[/note][xref]d[/xref]fire;</text>
        <note num="1">White hair signifies great age ([link]Job 15:10[/link]). Here it indicates the ancientness of the Lord. In S.S. [link]5:11[/link] He is depicted as having black hair, which signifies His unfading and everlasting strength.</note>
        <note num="2">White wool issues from the nature of life, and white snow comes from the sky, from heaven. Hence, white wool here and in [link]Dan. 7:9[/link] signifies that the ancientness of Christ is out of His nature, not out of His becoming old, while white snow signifies that His ancientness is heavenly, not earthly.</note>
        <note num="3">In S.S. [link]5:12[/link] the eyes of Christ are like doves. That is for the expression of His love. Here His eyes are like a flame of fire. This is for Him to observe and search that He may exercise judgment by enlightening. In this book His eyes are not two but seven ([link]5:6[/link]). Seven is the number of completion in God's move. Hence, Christ's eyes in this book are for God's operation. These seven eyes of His are the seven lamps of fire (cf. [link]Dan. 10:6[/link]) burning before the throne, and the seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God ([link]4:5[/link]). The "fire burning" equals the "flame of fire" and is for observing and searching. The seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth ([link]5:6[/link]) also are for God's move on the earth. Thus, the eyes of Christ in this book are the seven Spirits of God for God's move and operation on earth today.</note>
        <note num="4">This book has a judging nature. Fire is for divine judgment ([link]1 Cor. 3:13[/link]; [link]Heb. 6:8[/link]; [link]10:27[/link]). "Our God is also a consuming fire" ([link]Heb. 12:29[/link]); His throne is a fiery flame and its wheels are burning fire, and a fiery stream issues and comes forth from before Him ([link]Dan. 7:9-10[/link]). All this is for judgment. The Lord's eyes being like a flame of fire is mainly for His judgment ([link]2:18-23[/link]; [link]19:11-12[/link]). When He comes to take possession of the earth by exercising judgment over it, even His feet will be like pillars of fire ([link]10:1[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">Feet signify the walk. In typology bronze signifies divine judgment ([link]Exo. 27:1-6[/link]). The feet of Christ are like shining bronze, as mentioned also in [link]Dan. 10:6[/link], signifying that His perfect and bright walk qualifies Him to exercise divine judgment.

This is Christ's discerning, judging, and slaying word ([link]Heb. 4:12[/link]; [link]Eph. 6:17[/link]). The words of grace are for His supply of grace to His favored ones, whereas the sharp two-edged sword is for His dealing with negative persons and things.</note>
        <note num="3">In S.S.

Here, however, His face shone as the sun shines in its power (cf. [link]Dan. 10:6[/link]); this shining is the judging enlightenment for bringing in the kingdom. When He was transfigured and His face shone like the sun, that was His coming in the kingdom ([link]Matt. 16:28-17:2[/link]). When He comes to take over the earth for the kingdom, His face will be like the sun ([link]10:1[/link]).</note>

        <text>The [note]1[/note]mystery of the [xref]a[/xref]seven stars which you saw upon My right hand and the [xref]b[/xref]seven golden lampstands: The seven stars are the [note]2[/note]messengers of the [xref]c[/xref]seven churches, and the seven [xref]d[/xref]lampstands are the seven churches.</text>
        <note num="1">When John saw the seven stars upon the right hand of Christ and the seven golden lampstands in the midst of which was Christ, it was a mystery to him. He did not realize the significance of the seven heavenly stars and the seven golden lampstands. Hence, the Lord unveiled the mystery to him, saying that "the seven stars are the messengers of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches." The significance of this not only was a mystery to John but also is a mystery to believers today. All believers need the unveiling of this mystery that they may see the churches and their messengers.[br][br]The churches, signified by the seven golden lampstands, are the testimony of Jesus ([link]vv. 2[/link], [link]9[/link]) in the divine nature, shining in the dark night locally yet collectively. The churches should be of the divine nature &amp;#8212; golden. They should be the stands, even the lampstands, that bear the lamp with the oil (Christ as the life-giving Spirit) and shine in the darkness individually and collectively. They are individual lampstands locally, yet at the same time they are a group, a collection, of lampstands universally. They not only are shining locally but also are bearing universally the same testimony both to the localities and to the universe. They are of the same nature and in the same shape. They bear the same lamp for the same purpose and are fully identified with one another, not having any individual distinctiveness. The differences among the seven churches recorded in [link]chs. 2[/link] and [link book="Rev."]3[/link] are all of a negative nature, not a positive one. Negatively, in their failures, the churches are different and separate from one another; but positively, in their nature, shape, and purpose, they are absolutely identical and are connected to one another.[br][br]It is easy for believers to see the universal church, but it is difficult for them to see the churches. The revelation of the local churches is the Lord's ultimate unveiling concerning the church, and it is recorded in the last book of the divine Word. To fully know the church, believers must follow the Lord from the Gospels through the Epistles to the book of Revelation until they are enabled to see the local churches as unveiled here. In Revelation the first vision is concerning the churches. The churches with Christ as their one center are the focus in the divine administration for the accomplishing of God's eternal purpose.[br][br]The messengers are the spiritual ones in the churches, the ones who bear the responsibility for the testimony of Jesus. They should be of the heavenly nature and should be in a heavenly position like stars. In the Acts and the Epistles the elders were the leading ones in the managing of the local churches ([link]Acts 14:23[/link]; [link]20:17[/link]; [link]Titus 1:5[/link]). The eldership is somewhat official, and at the time this book was written the offices in the churches had deteriorated because of the degradation of the church. In this book the Lord calls our attention back to the spiritual reality. Hence, this book emphasizes the messengers of the churches rather than the elders. The office of the elders is easily perceived, but the believers need to see the importance of the spiritual and heavenly reality of the messengers for the proper church life to bear the testimony of Jesus in the darkness of the church's degradation. In the first vision of this book, the vision concerning the churches, both Christ and the messengers of the churches are unveiled with the churches as never before, and this in a most particular way. For this the believers need to see a particular vision in their spirits.</note>

        <note num="1">The seven epistles in [link]chs. 2[/link] and [link book="Rev."]3[/link] are the record of the actual situation existing in the seven churches at the time these epistles were written. However, since this book is a book of signs with a prophetic nature, the situations of the seven churches also are signs, signifying prophetically the progress of the church in seven stages. The first epistle, to the church in Ephesus, provides a picture of the end of the initial church, the church in the first stage, during the latter part of the first century. The second epistle, to the church in Smyrna, prefigures the suffering church under the persecution of the Roman Empire, from the latter part of the first century to the early part of the fourth century, when Constantine the Great, the Caesar of the Roman Empire, brought the church into imperial favor. The third epistle, to the church in Pergamos, pre-symbolizes the worldly church, the church married to the world, from the day Constantine accepted Christianity to the time the papal system was established in the latter part of the sixth century. The fourth epistle, to the church in Thyatira, depicts prophetically the apostate church, from the ordaining of the papal system in the latter part of the sixth century to the end of this age, when Christ comes back. The fifth epistle, to the church in Sardis, prefigures the Protestant Church, from the Reformation in the early part of the sixteenth century to Christ's coming back. The sixth epistle, to the church in Philadelphia, predicts the church of brotherly love, the recovery of the proper church life, from the early part of the nineteenth century, when the brothers were raised up in England to practice the church outside all denominational and divisive systems, to the second appearing of the Lord. The seventh epistle, to the church in Laodicea, foreshadows the degraded church life of the brothers in the nineteenth century, from the latter part of the nineteenth century until the Lord's return.</note>
        <note num="2">In Greek the names of the seven cities are full of significance, each name exactly matching the spiritual condition of the church in that particular city.

On one hand, the Lord is sitting at the right hand of God, as our High Priest interceding for us, the churches ([link]Heb. 7:25[/link]); on the other hand, He is holding the messengers of the churches and is walking in the midst of the churches to care for them.</note>

        <note num="2">As the Body of Christ ([link]Eph. 1:23[/link]), the church is a matter of life; as the new man ([link]Eph. 2:15[/link]), it is a matter of the person of Christ; and as the bride of Christ ([link]John 3:29[/link]), it is a matter of love. The first Epistle to the Ephesians tells us that for the church life we need to be strengthened into our inner man that Christ may make His home in our hearts, that we, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God ([link]Eph. 3:16-19[/link]); and it is for the church life that grace is with all those who love the Lord Jesus ([link]Eph. 6:24[/link]). Now this second epistle to the Ephesians reveals that the degradation of the church begins with our leaving the first love toward the Lord. Nothing but love can keep us in a proper relationship with the Lord. The church in Ephesus had good works, labored for the Lord, endured suffering, and tried the false apostles ([link]vv. 2-3[/link]), but she left her first love toward the Lord. The leaving of the first love is the source of all the degradation in the succeeding stages of the church.</note>

        <note num="1">The Greek word is composed of two words, one meaning [i]conquer[/i] or [i]be victorious over[/i] and another meaning [i]common people, secular people,[/i] or [i]laity.[/i] Thus, it means [i]conquering the common people, being victorious over the laity. Nicolaitans,[/i] then, must refer to a group of people who esteem themselves higher than common believers. This was undoubtedly the hierarchy adopted and established by Catholicism and Protestantism. The Lord hates the works, the behavior, of these Nicolaitans, and we must hate what the Lord hates.[br][br]God in His economy intended that all His people be priests serving Him directly. In [link]Exo. 19:6[/link], God ordained the children of Israel to be a kingdom of priests. This means that God wanted them all to be priests. However, because they worshipped the golden calf ([link]Exo. 32:1-6[/link]), they lost the priesthood, and only the tribe of Levi, because of its faithfulness to God, was chosen to replace the whole nation of Israel as priests to God ([link]Exo. 32:25-29[/link]; [link]Deut. 33:8-10[/link]). Hence, there was a mediatorial class between God and the children of Israel. This became a strong system in Judaism. In the New Testament, God has returned to His original intention according to His economy, in that He has made all believers in Christ priests ([link]1:6[/link]; [link]5:10[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 2:5[/link], [link]9[/link]). But at the end of the initial church, even in the first century, the Nicolaitans intervened as the mediatorial class to spoil God's economy. According to church history, this became a system that was adopted by the Roman Catholic Church and has been retained by the Protestant churches. Today in the Roman Catholic Church there is the priestly system, in the state churches there is the clerical system, and in the independent churches there is the pastoral system. All these are a mediatorial class, spoiling the universal priesthood of all believers. Thus, there are two distinct classes &amp;#8212; the clergy and the laity. But in the proper church life there should be neither clergy nor laity; all believers should be priests of God. Because the mediatorial class destroys the universal priesthood in God's economy, the Lord hates it.[br][br]Among the seven serving ones in [link]Acts 6:5[/link], one was named Nikolaos (Gk.). There is nothing in church history to indicate that this Nikolaos was the first of the Nicolaitans.</note>

        <note num="1">Although our angle and position may be right, we still may not have the proper ear to hear. [link]Chapter 1[/link] emphasizes seeing and [link]chs. 2[/link] and [link book="Rev."]3[/link] emphasize hearing. In spiritual things, seeing depends on hearing. The writer of this book first heard the voice ([link]1:10[/link]) and then saw the vision ([link]1:12[/link]). If our ears are dull and cannot hear, then we cannot see ([link]Isa. 6:9-10[/link]). The Jews would not hear the word of the Lord, so they could not see what the Lord was doing according to the new testament ([link]Matt. 13:15[/link]; [link]Acts 28:27[/link]). The Lord always wants to open our ears to hear His voice ([link]Job 33:14-16[/link]; [link]Isa. 50:4-5[/link]; [link]Exo. 21:6[/link]) that we may see things according to His economy. The dull ears need to be circumcised ([link]Jer. 6:10[/link]; [link]Acts 7:51[/link]). The sinners' ears need to be cleansed with the redeeming blood and anointed with the Spirit ([link]Lev. 14:14[/link], [link]17[/link], [link]28[/link]). To serve the Lord as priests, we must have our ears cleansed with the redeeming blood ([link]Exo. 29:20[/link]; [link]Lev. 8:23-24[/link]). According to this book, as the Spirit is speaking to the churches, we all need an opened, circumcised, cleansed, and anointed ear to hear the Spirit's speaking.</note>
        <note num="2">At the beginning of each of the seven epistles recorded in [link]chs. 2[/link] and [link book="Rev."]3[/link], it is the Lord who speaks ([link]vv. 1[/link], [link]8[/link], [link]12[/link], [link]18[/link]; [link]3:1[/link], [link]7[/link], [link]14[/link]). But at the end of each epistle, it is the Spirit who speaks to the churches ([link]vv. 7[/link], [link]11[/link], [link]17[/link], [link]29[/link]; [link]3:6[/link], [link]13[/link], [link]22[/link]). This not only indicates that the Spirit is the Lord and the Lord is the Spirit, but it also emphasizes that in the darkness of the church's degradation the Spirit is vitally important, as indicated by the sevenfold intensified Spirit in [link]1:4[/link]. The same emphasis is seen also in [link]14:13[/link] and [link]22:17[/link].</note>
        <note num="3">On one hand, each of the seven epistles is the Lord's word to a particular church, but on the other hand, it is the Spirit's word to all the churches. Every church needed to give heed not only to the epistle written to her particularly but also to all the epistles written to the other churches. This implies that all the churches, as the Lord's testimony in the Spirit, should be the same.[br][br]Since the Spirit today is speaking to the churches, we must be in the churches to be rightly positioned to hear the Spirit's speaking. Otherwise, how could we hear?</note>
        <note num="4">In these seven epistles, to overcome is to overcome the degraded situation of the churches. In this epistle, to overcome is to recover our first love toward the Lord and to hate the works of the Nicolaitans, the hierarchy that the Lord hates.</note>
        <note num="5">Religion always teaches, but the Lord feeds ([link]John 6:35[/link]). The apostle Paul did the same thing; that is, he fed the believers ([link]1 Cor. 3:2[/link]). For the proper church life and the recovery of the church life, that is, for the proper growth in the Christian life, what we need is not merely the mental apprehension of teachings but the eating of the Lord as our bread of life in our spirit ([link]John 6:57[/link]). Even the words of the Scripture should not be considered merely as doctrines to teach our mind but as food to nourish our spirit ([link]Matt. 4:4[/link]; [link]Heb. 5:12-14[/link]). Here in this epistle the Lord promised to give the overcomer to eat of the tree of life. This points back to [link]Gen. 2:8-9[/link], [link]16[/link], which concerns the matter of eating ordained by God. In the epistle to the church in Pergamos, the Lord promised the overcomer that he would eat of the hidden manna ([link]v. 17[/link]), which refers to the eating of manna by the children of Israel in the wilderness ([link]Exo. 16:14-16[/link], [link]31[/link]). And in the epistle to the church in Laodicea, the Lord promised to dine with the one who opens the door to Him. To dine is to eat not merely one kind of food but the riches of a feast. This may refer to the eating of the rich produce of the good land of Canaan by the children of Israel ([link]Josh. 5:10-12[/link]). This indicates that the Lord desires to recover the eating of the proper food by God's people, the food ordained by God and typified by the tree of life, the manna, and the produce of the good land, all of which are types of the various aspects of Christ as food to us. The degradation of the church distracts God's people from the eating of Christ as their food and turns them to the teaching of doctrines for knowledge. In the church's degradation there are the teaching of Balaam ([link]v. 14[/link]), the teaching of the Nicolaitans ([link]v. 15[/link]), the teaching by Jezebel ([link]v. 20[/link]), and the teaching of the deep things of Satan ([link]v. 24[/link]). Now in these epistles the Lord came to recover the proper eating of Himself as our food supply. We must eat Him not only as the tree of life and the hidden manna but also as a feast full of His riches.</note>
        <note num="6">In Greek the word for [i]tree[/i] here, as in [link]1 Pet. 2:24[/link], means [i]wood;[/i] it is not the word usually used for [i]tree.[/i] In the Bible the tree of life always signifies Christ as the embodiment of all the riches of God ([link]Col. 2:9[/link]) for our food ([link]Gen. 2:9[/link]; [link]3:22[/link], [link]24[/link]; [link]Rev. 22:2[/link], [link]14[/link], [link]19[/link]). Here it signifies the crucified (implied in the tree as a piece of wood &amp;#8212; [link]1 Pet. 2:24[/link]) and resurrected (implied in the life of God &amp;#8212; [link]John 11:25[/link]) Christ, who today is in the church, the consummation of which will be the New Jerusalem, in which the crucified and resurrected Christ will be the tree of life for the nourishment of all God's redeemed people for eternity ([link]22:2[/link], [link]14[/link]).[br][br]God's original intention was that man should eat of the tree of life ([link]Gen. 2:9[/link], [link]16[/link]). Because of the fall, the way to the tree of life was closed to man ([link]Gen. 3:22-24[/link]). Through the redemption of Christ, the way by which man could touch the tree of life, which is God Himself in Christ as life to man, was opened again ([link]Heb. 10:19-20[/link]). But in the church's degradation, religion crept in with its knowledge to distract the believers in Christ from eating Him as the tree of life. Hence, the Lord promised to grant the overcomers to eat of Himself as the tree of life in the Paradise of God, as a reward. This is an incentive for them to leave religion with its knowledge and return to the enjoyment of Himself. This promise of the Lord restores the church to God's original intention according to His economy. What the Lord wants the overcomers to do is what the whole church should do in God's economy. Because of the church's degradation, the Lord came to call the overcomers to replace the church in the accomplishing of God's economy.[br][br]The eating of the tree of life not only was God's original intention concerning man but also will be the eternal issue of God's redemption. All God's redeemed people will enjoy the tree of life, which is Christ with all the divine riches as the redeemed's eternal portion for eternity ([link]Rev. 22:2[/link], [link]14[/link], [link]19[/link]). Because of religion's distraction and the church's degradation, the Lord in His wisdom made the enjoyment of Himself in the coming kingdom a reward in order to encourage His believers to overcome religion's distracting knowledge in teachings and return to the enjoyment of Himself as the life supply in the church life today for the accomplishing of God's economy.[br][br]Eating the tree of life, that is, enjoying Christ as our life supply, should be the primary matter in the church life. The content of the church life depends on the enjoyment of Christ. The more we enjoy Him, the richer the content will be. But to enjoy Christ requires us to love Him with the first love. If we leave our first love toward the Lord, we will miss the enjoyment of Christ and lose the testimony of Jesus; consequently, the lampstand will be removed from us. These three things &amp;#8212; loving the Lord, enjoying the Lord, and being the testimony of the Lord &amp;#8212; go together.</note>
        <note num="7">The Paradise in [link]Luke 23:43[/link] is the pleasant and restful place where Abraham and all the dead saints are ([link]Luke 16:23-26[/link]). But the Paradise of God in this verse is the New Jerusalem ([link]3:12[/link]; [link]21:2[/link], [link]10[/link]; [link]22:1-2[/link], [link]14[/link], [link]19[/link]), of which the church is a foretaste today. We are enjoying the crucified and resurrected Christ as the tree of life, the food supply in our spirit, as a foretaste today in the church. This enjoyment of the foretaste will usher us into the full taste of the crucified and resurrected Christ as the tree of life, our nourishment of life in the New Jerusalem for eternity.[br][br]Strictly, [i]to eat of the tree of life[/i]...in the Paradise of God in this verse refers to the particular enjoyment of Christ as our life supply in the New Jerusalem in the coming millennial kingdom, because this is a promise of reward made by the Lord to His overcomers. The enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth will be the common portion of all God's redeemed people, whereas the particular enjoyment of Him as the tree of life in the New Jerusalem in the coming millennial kingdom is a reward given only to the overcoming believers. If we overcome all the distractions in the church's degradation to enjoy Christ as the tree of life in the church today, we will be thus rewarded. Otherwise, we will miss this particular enjoyment in the coming kingdom, though we will still enjoy Christ as the tree of life in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth for eternity. The Lord's promises concerning the reward and the Lord's predictions concerning the loss, at the end of each of the seven epistles, refer to His dealing with His believers in the coming millennial kingdom. They have nothing to do with the believers' eternal destiny &amp;#8212; eternal salvation or eternal perdition.</note>

        <note num="1">The Greek word means [i]myrrh,[/i] and myrrh in figure signifies suffering. Thus, the church in Smyrna was a suffering church.

        <note num="3">The Judaizers slandered the suffering church by evilly criticizing her. They stubbornly insisted on keeping their Judaistic system, consisting of the Levitical priesthood, the sacrificial rituals, and the material temple, which were all types that had been fulfilled and replaced by Christ. Since the church under the new covenant in God's economy had no part in their religious practice, the Judaizers slanderously criticized her. In principle, it is the same today, in that religious people slander the churches in the Lord's recovery, which seek the Lord and follow Him in spirit and in life and do not care for any religious system or practice.</note>
        <note num="4">The Judaizers were Jews in the flesh but not Jews in spirit ([link]Rom. 2:28-29[/link]). Merely being the seed of Abraham did not constitute them true Jews. Those who are the children of the flesh are not the children of God ([link]Rom. 9:7-8[/link]).</note>
        <note num="5">The goal of God's economy is to have a unique temple on earth to testify of God and of the oneness of God's people. In the Old Testament, the place that God chose for the establishing of His unique temple was Jerusalem. Because God's people became fallen, divided, and scattered, numerous fallen, divided centers of worship were raised up; these became the synagogues. These synagogues were the places in which the Jews worshipped God mainly by studying their Scriptures, the Old Testament. However, because of their stubbornness in clinging to their traditional religious concepts, the Jews became one with Satan in opposing God's way of life, by which He fulfills His purpose. Under the manipulating, maneuvering hand of Satan, their synagogues opposed the Lord Jesus ([link]Matt. 12:9-14[/link]; [link]Luke 4:28-29[/link]; [link]John 9:22[/link]), then the apostles ([link]Acts 13:43[/link], [link]45-46[/link], [link]50[/link]; [link]14:1-2[/link], [link]19[/link]; [link]17:1[/link], [link]5-6[/link]), and then the churches. Therefore, the Lord called them "a synagogue of Satan." Even when He was on earth, He considered the synagogues to be of Satan, as implied in [link]Matt. 12:25-29[/link] and [link]John 8:44[/link]. Apparently, those in the synagogues were worshipping God; actually, they were opposing God. They persecuted and killed God's true worshippers, yet they considered that they were offering service to God ([link]John 16:2[/link]). Through all the centuries since then, religious people have followed in their steps, persecuting those who genuinely seek and follow the Lord in spirit and life, while still considering that they are defending the interests of God. Roman Catholicism and Protestantism, as well as Judaism, all fall into this category, having become an organization of Satan as his tool to damage God's economy.</note>

However severe were the persecutions instigated by the devil, Satan, through the Roman Caesars, who did their utmost to destroy and eliminate the church, they could not subdue and terminate the church.

        <note num="1">In this epistle to overcome is to overcome persecution by being faithful unto death.</note>
        <note num="2">Because of the fall and the entering in of sin, every man must die once ([link]Heb. 9:27[/link]). This first death, however, is not the final settlement. All the dead, except those who through faith in the Lord Jesus have been recorded in the book of life, will be resurrected and will pass through the judgment of the great white throne at the close of the millennium, i.e., at the conclusion of the old heaven and old earth. As a result of this judgment, the condemned ones will all be cast into the lake of fire, which is the second death as the final settlement ([link]20:11-15[/link]). Hence, the second death is God's dealing with man after man's death and resurrection. Since the overcomers will have overcome death through their faithfulness unto death under persecution and will require no further dealing by God after their resurrection, they will be rewarded with the crown of life and will no longer be touched by death after their resurrection; i.e., they will not be hurt by the second death.</note>

        <note num="2">The Lord's name denotes the Lord's person; the person is the reality of the name. The Lord's faith denotes all that we must believe in concerning the Lord's person and work. It does not denote the subjective faith within us, i.e., our believing, but the objective faith, i.e., the things in which we believe. Because the church entered into union with the world, she began to disregard the Lord's name and deny the proper Christian faith.</note>
        <note num="3">In Greek [i]Antipas[/i] means [i]against[/i] all. Antipas, a faithful witness of the Lord, stood against all that the worldly church brought in and practiced. Hence, he became a martyr of the Lord. In Greek the word for [i]martyr[/i] is the same as that for [i]witness.[/i] Antipas, as an anti-witness, bore an anti-testimony, a testimony against anything that deviated from the testimony of Jesus. It must have been through his anti-testimony that in his days the church in Pergamos still held fast the Lord's name and did not deny the proper Christian faith.</note>

        <note num="1">The worldly and degraded church holds not only the teaching of Balaam but also the teaching of the Nicolaitans. The teaching of Balaam distracts believers from the person of Christ to idolatry and from the enjoyment of Christ to spiritual fornication, whereas the teaching of the Nicolaitans destroys the function of believers as members of the Body of Christ, thus annulling the Lord's Body as His expression. The former teaching disregards the Head, and the latter destroys the Body. This is the subtle intention of the enemy in all religious teachings.[br][br]In the church in Ephesus only the works of the Nicolaitans were found ([link]v. 6[/link]), whereas in the church in Pergamos their works had progressed to become a teaching. First, the Nicolaitans practiced the hierarchy in the initial church; then they taught it in the degraded church. Today, in both Catholicism and Protestantism, this Nicolaitan hierarchy prevails in both practice and teaching.</note>

        <note num="1">Here to overcome is specifically to overcome the church's union with the world, the teaching of idolatry and fornication, and the teaching of hierarchy.</note>
        <note num="2">Manna is a type of Christ as the heavenly food that enables God's people to go His way. A portion of manna was preserved in a golden pot concealed in the Ark ([link]Exo. 16:32-34[/link]; [link]Heb. 9:4[/link]). The open manna was for the Lord's people to enjoy in a public way; the hidden manna, signifying the hidden Christ, is a special portion reserved for His overcoming seekers, who overcome the degradation of the worldly church. While the church goes the way of the world, these overcomers come forward to abide in the presence of God in the Holy of Holies, where they enjoy the hidden Christ as a special portion for their daily supply. This promise is being fulfilled today in the proper church life and will be fulfilled in full in the coming kingdom. If we seek the Lord, overcome the degradation of the worldly church, and enjoy a special portion of the Lord today, He as the hidden manna will be a reward to us in the coming kingdom. If we miss Him as our special portion today in the church life, we will surely lose the enjoyment of Him as a reward in the coming kingdom.</note>
        <note num="3">In the Bible a stone signifies material for God's building ([link]Matt. 16:18[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 2:5[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 3:12[/link]). In our natural being we are not stones but clay. Because we received the divine life with its divine nature through regeneration, we can be transformed into stones, even precious stones, by enjoying Christ as our life supply ([link]2 Cor. 3:18[/link]). If we do not follow the worldly church but enjoy the Lord in the proper church life, we will be transformed into stones for the building of God. These stones will be justified and approved by the Lord, as indicated by the color white, while the worldly church will be condemned and rejected by Him. God's work of building the church depends on our transformation, and our transformation issues from the enjoyment of Christ as our life supply.</note>
        <note num="4">A name designates a person; a new name designates a transformed person. Every transformed believer, as a white stone, bears "a new name...which no one knows except him who receives it." Such a new name is the interpretation of the experience of the one who has been transformed. Hence, only he himself knows the meaning of that name.</note>

        <note num="1">The number seven in the Bible is composed either of six plus one, e.g., six days plus one day equals one week; or of three plus four, as in these two chapters, in which the seven churches are divided into one group of three and another group of four. At the end of each of the first three epistles, the ear for hearing is mentioned first, and then the call for overcoming. At the end of each of the last four epistles, the order is reversed. This proves that the first three epistles form one group, and the last four another. Six plus one is seen in God's creation, whereas three plus four is seen in God's new creation, the church. Since all things were created in six days, the number six signifies the creation, especially man, who was created on the sixth day; and since the seventh day, as the conclusion of the six days, was the one day of God's rest, the number one signifies the unique Creator. Hence, six plus one signifies that all things were created unto God for the accomplishing of His purpose. The unique Creator, God, is triune, signified by the number three. Since the creation is represented before God by four living creatures ([link]4:6-9[/link]), the number four signifies the creatures, especially man. Hence, three plus four means that God is added to the created man, and thus His purpose is being accomplished. The church is not only the creature but the creature with the Creator as the Triune God dispensed into her. She is the real number seven: the real three, the Triune God, added to the real four, created man. Therefore, the number seven denotes completion in God's move, first in the old creation and then in the new creation, the church.</note>

        <text>And to the messenger of the church in [note]1[/note]Sardis write: These things says He who has the [note]2[/note][xref]a[/xref]seven Spirits of God and the [note]2[/note][xref]b[/xref]seven stars: I [xref]c[/xref]know your works, that you have a [note]3[/note]name that you are [xref]d[/xref]living, and yet you are [xref]e[/xref]dead.</text>
        <note num="1">The Greek word means [i]the remains, the remainder,[/i] or [i]the restoration.[/i] As a sign, the church in Sardis prefigures the Protestant church, from the time of the Reformation to the second coming of Christ. The Reformation was God's reaction to the apostate Roman Catholic Church, which is signified by the degraded church in Thyatira. It was accomplished by a minority of the believers, the remainder. Hence, it was a restoration by the remainder.</note>
        <note num="2">The seven Spirits of God enable the church to be intensely living, and the seven stars enable her to be intensely shining. To the church in Ephesus, Christ was the One who held the seven stars and walked in the midst of the seven lampstands. The initial church needed the care of Christ, and her leaders needed His keeping grace. To the church in Smyrna, He was the One who became dead and lived again. The suffering church needed the resurrection life of Christ. To the church in Pergamos, Christ was the One who has the sharp two-edged sword. The degraded, worldly church needed His judging and slaying word. To the church in Thyatira, He was the One who has eyes like flaming fire and feet like shining bronze. The apostate church needed His searching and judging. Here, to the church in Sardis, He was the One who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars. The dead, reformed church needed the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God and the shining leaders. The sevenfold intensified Spirit is living and can never be replaced by the dead letters of knowledge ([link]2 Cor. 3:6[/link]).</note>
        <note num="3">Many have considered the reformed Protestant Church to be living, but the Lord says that she is dead. Hence, she needs the living Spirits and the shining stars.</note>

        <note num="1">"The things which remain" are the things that had been lost and were restored by the Reformation, such as justification by faith, the open Bible, etc. Though these things had been restored, they were about to die. Hence, they needed to be revived. This is the actual situation of the Protestant churches.</note>
        <note num="2">Nothing begun in the Reformation has ever been completed. Therefore, the church in Philadelphia is needed for the completion.</note>

        <note num="1">Garments in the Bible signify what we are in our walk and living. To defile one's garments means particularly to stain them with deadness. Death is more defiling before God than sin ([link]Lev. 11:24-25[/link]; [link]Num. 6:6-7[/link], [link]9[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">White signifies not only purity but also approvedness. White garments here signify the walk and living that are unspotted by death and that will be approved by the Lord. This is a qualification for walking with the Lord, especially in the coming kingdom.</note>

        <note num="1">To overcome here is to overcome the deadness of the Protestant churches, i.e., to overcome dead Protestantism.</note>
        <note num="2">Being clothed in white garments, as promised here, will be a prize to the overcomers in the millennial kingdom. What they have been walking in in this age will be a prize to them in the coming age. Every Christian needs two garments. The first is the garment of justification for our salvation, signifying Christ, the Christ whom we received, as our objective righteousness ([link]Luke 15:22[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 1:30[/link]). The second is the garment of approvedness for our acceptance, signifying Christ, the Christ whom we live out, as our subjective righteousness ([link]Phil. 1:21[/link]; [link]3:9[/link]). The white garments mentioned here refer to the second garment, which is needed for us to receive the reward and enter into the kingdom to walk with the Lord, that is, to reign with Him ([link]2 Tim. 2:11-12[/link]). See note [link]8[sup]2[/sup] in ch. 19[/link].</note>
        <note num="3">The entire verse is the Lord's promise to the overcomers. It will be fulfilled in the millennial kingdom after the Lord comes back. That a name is erased out of the book of life indicates that that name has already been written in the book of life. The book of life is a divine record of the names of those who partake of the blessings that God has prepared for them. The names of all the saints chosen by God and predestinated to partake of these blessings are written in this book ([link]Luke 10:20[/link]). These blessings are in three stages: (1) in the church, (2) in the millennial kingdom, and (3) in eternity. The blessings in the stage of the church, such as forgiveness, redemption, regeneration, eternal life, the divine nature, etc., are the initial portions. All God's chosen ones whose names are written in the book of life have a share in these initial portions to begin their spiritual life. If they cooperate with God's supplying grace, they will mature in life in the church age, and this earlier maturity in life will constitute a prize with which the Lord will reward them at His coming back. That prize will be the entrance into the millennial kingdom and participation in the divine blessings in that stage, such as the joy and rest of the Lord ([link]Matt. 25:21[/link], [link]23[/link]; [link]Heb. 4:9-11[/link]), the reign over the nations ([link]2:26-27[/link]; [link]20:4[/link], [link]6[/link]), etc., which God has prepared as an incentive for His chosen ones to go on with Him in the church age. However, many of His chosen ones, after receiving His forgiveness, redemption, eternal life, divine nature, etc., will not cooperate with His grace and will not go on with Him. Hence, they are unable to mature in life in the church age and thus will not be ready at the Lord's coming back to enter into the millennial kingdom and share in the divine blessings of that age as a prize. Therefore, during the millennial kingdom their names will be erased from the book of life. After being disciplined by the Lord and growing in life unto maturity during the millennial kingdom, they will share in the divine blessings in the stage of eternity, such as the eternal priesthood with God's eternal presence, the eternal kingship ([link]22:3-5[/link]), the New Jerusalem, the tree of life ([link]22:14[/link]), the water of life ([link]22:17[/link]), etc. At that time their names should again be written in the book of life. This means that all God's chosen ones whose names are written in the book of life and who have been brought into the participation of the divine blessings in the stage of the church "shall by no means perish forever" ([link]John 10:28[/link]); that is, they shall by no means lose the divine blessings of eternity. But some, those who do not cooperate with the Lord in the church age, will be dispensationally disciplined by the Lord during the millennial kingdom and will miss the divine blessings in that stage.</note>

        <note num="5">In the kingdom age the Lord will confess the name of the overcomer because the overcomer's name will not have been erased out of the book of life but will still be written in it. This implies that if the believers are not overcomers, in the kingdom age their names will be erased out of the book of life (see note [link]5[sup]3[/sup][/link]) and therefore will not be confessed by the Lord.</note>

        <note num="1">The Greek word means [i]brotherly love.[/i] As a sign, the church in Philadelphia prefigures the proper church life recovered by the brothers raised up by the Lord in England in the early part of the nineteenth century. Just as the reformed church, prefigured by the church in Sardis, was a reaction to the apostate Catholic Church, prefigured by the church in Thyatira, so the church of brotherly love was a reaction to the dead reformed church. This reaction will continue as an anti-testimony to both apostate Catholicism and degraded Protestantism until the Lord comes back.</note>
        <note num="2">To the church of brotherly love, the Lord is the Holy One, the true One, by whom and with whom the recovered church can be holy, separated from the world, and true, faithful, to God.</note>
        <note num="3">To the recovered church, the Lord is also the One who has the key of David, the key of the kingdom, with authority to open and to shut. The Lord uses this key to deal with the recovered church.</note>

        <note num="1">As the One who has the key of David and who opens and no one will shut, the Lord has given the recovered church an opened door, which no one can shut. Since the recovery of the proper church life began, in the early part of the nineteenth century, until now, a door has always been opened wide to the Lord's recovery. The more organized Christianity tries to shut the door, the wider it is opened. In spite of much opposition, today the door is open worldwide. The key is in the hand of the Head of the church; it is not in the hand of the opposers.</note>
        <note num="2">This indicates that what pleases the Lord is not our doing much for Him but our doing our best for Him with what we have.</note>
        <note num="3">The Lord's word is the Lord's expression, and the Lord's name is the Lord Himself. The apostate church has deviated from the Lord's word and become heretical. The reformed church, though recovered to the Lord's word to some extent, has denied the Lord's name by denominating herself, taking many other names, such as Lutheran, Wesleyan, Anglican, Presbyterian, Baptist, etc. The recovered church not only has returned in a full way to the Lord's word but also has abandoned all names other than that of the Lord Jesus Christ. The recovered church belongs to the Lord absolutely, having nothing to do with any denominations (any names). To deviate from the Lord's word is apostasy, and to denominate the church by taking any name other than the Lord's is spiritual fornication. The church, as the pure virgin espoused to Christ ([link]2 Cor. 11:2[/link]), should have no name other than her Husband's. All other names are an abomination in the eyes of God. In the recovered church life there are no teachings of Balaam ([link]2:14[/link]), no teachings of the Nicolaitans ([link]2:15[/link]), no teachings of Jezebel ([link]2:20[/link]), and no mysterious doctrines of Satan ([link]2:24[/link]); there is only the pure word of the Lord. The recovered church has no denominations (names); it has only the unique name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The deviation from the word to heresies and the exalting of many names other than that of Christ are the most striking signs of degraded Christianity. The return to the pure word from all heresies and traditions and the exalting of the Lord's name by abandoning every other name constitute the most inspiring testimony in the recovered church. This is why the church in the Lord's recovery has the revelation and presence of the Lord and expresses the Lord in a living way, full of light and with the riches of life.</note>

The trial also includes the supernatural calamities of the sixth seal and the first four trumpets at the beginning of the great tribulation. The Lord promised the recovered church that He would keep her out of the hour of trial (not only out of the trial, but out of the [i]hour[/i] of trial) because she has kept the word of the Lord's endurance. This promise of the Lord, like His promise in [link]Luke 21:36[/link], indicates that the saints who keep the word of the Lord's endurance will be raptured before the great trial, implying that those who do not keep the word of the Lord's endurance will be left in the trial.</note>

        <note num="1">The Greek word means [i]opinion, judgment, of the people[/i] or [i]of the laymen.[/i] As a sign, the church in Laodicea prefigures the degraded recovered church. Less than one century after the Lord recovered the proper church in the early part of the nineteenth century, some of the recovered "assemblies" (called such by the Brethren) became degraded. The degraded recovered church differs from the reformed church, signified by the church in Sardis, and from the proper recovered church, signified by the church in Philadelphia. It will exist until the Lord comes back.</note>
        <note num="2">In addressing each of the seven churches, the Lord referred to what He is and what He does, respectively, according to the situation and condition of each. Here, in addressing the church in Laodicea, He referred to Himself as "the Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the beginning of the creation of God." [i]Amen,[/i] from Hebrew, means [i]firm, steadfast,[/i] or [i]trustworthy.[/i] The Lord is the firm, steadfast, and trustworthy One. Hence, He is the faithful and true Witness.

        <note num="2">In the Bible our operating, working faith ([link]Gal. 5:6[/link]) is likened to gold ([link]1 Pet. 1:7[/link]), and the divine nature of God, which is the divinity of Christ, is typified by gold ([link]Exo. 25:11[/link]). By faith we partake of the divine nature of God ([link]2 Pet. 1:1[/link], [link]4-5[/link]). The degraded recovered church has the knowledge of the doctrines concerning Christ but not much living faith to partake of the divine element of Christ. She needs to pay the price to gain the golden faith through the fiery trials that she may participate in the real gold, which is Christ Himself as the life element to His Body. Thus she can become a pure golden lampstand ([link]1:20[/link]) for the building of the golden New Jerusalem ([link]21:18[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">The seven churches not only signify prophetically the progress of the church in seven ages, as we have seen, but also symbolize the seven kinds of churches in church history: the initial church, the suffering church, the worldly church, the apostate church, the reformed church, the recovered church, and the degraded recovered church. The initial church had its continuation in the suffering church; the suffering church became the worldly church; and the worldly church became the apostate church. Hence, the first four churches issued eventually in one kind of church, that is, the apostate church, the Roman Catholic Church. Then the reformed church, as a reaction to the apostate church, came into existence as another kind of church, a church not fully recovered. Hence, after this, the recovered church was raised up as a full recovery of the proper church life. This can be considered the third kind of church. Through the degradation of the recovered church, the degraded recovered church came into being. This can be counted as the fourth kind of church. These four kinds of churches will all remain until the Lord comes back. Undoubtedly, only the recovered church can fulfill God's eternal purpose, and only she is what the Lord is after. We must take the Lord's choice.</note>

        <note num="1">According to [link]21:11[/link], the jasper is "a most precious stone...as clear as crystal." Its color must be dark green, which signifies life in its richness. Jasper here, as indicated in [link]21:11[/link], signifies God's communicable glory in His rich life ([link]John 17:22[/link], [link]2[/link]). God's appearance is like jasper, as also the appearance of the holy city, New Jerusalem, will be ([link]21:11[/link]).

        <note num="2">The sardius too is a most precious stone, and its red color signifies redemption.

On the breastplate of the high priest in the Old Testament, the first stone was a sardius and the last a jasper ([link]Exo. 28:17[/link], [link]20[/link]). This signifies that God's redeemed people have their beginning in God's redemption and their consummation in God's glory of life.</note>
        <note num="3">The rainbow is a sign of God's covenant with man and all living creatures that He will not destroy them again with a flood ([link]Gen. 9:8-17[/link]). This book shows that God will judge the earth with all its inhabitants. The rainbow around His throne signifies that God is the covenanting God, the faithful God, who will keep His covenant while executing His judgment upon the earth. He will not judge mankind again with a flood nor destroy all mankind, but will keep a part of mankind to be the nations on the new earth for His glory ([link]21:24[/link], [link]26[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">Twenty-four is formed by multiplying twelve by two. Twelve indicates the completion of God's administration ([link]Matt. 19:28[/link]). David divided both the priests and the Levites into twenty-four groups to carry out God's administrative service. Therefore, before they are replaced by the church, the twenty-four angelic elders are the ones who carry out God's administration. Twelve multiplied by two signifies strengthening by doubling, indicating that the divine administration carried out by the twenty-four angelic elders is strong.</note>
        <note num="2">The elders here are not the elders of the church but the elders of the angels, because here, before the Lord's second coming, they are sitting on thrones already (cf. [link]Matt. 19:28[/link]; [link]Rev. 20:4[/link]). Among God's creation the angels are the most ancient ones. Their elders are the elders of the whole creation of God.

        <note num="1">This glassy sea is not of water but of fire ([link]15:2[/link]). Since the deluge, God, in accordance with His promise that He would not judge the earth and all living creatures again with water ([link]Gen. 9:15[/link]), always exercises His judgment upon man with fire ([link]Gen. 19:24[/link]; [link]Lev. 10:2[/link]; [link]Num. 11:1[/link]; [link]16:35[/link]; [link]Dan. 7:11[/link]; [link]Rev. 14:10[/link]; [link]18:8[/link]; [link]19:20[/link]; [link]20:9-10[/link]; [link]21:8[/link]). God's throne of judgment is like the fiery flame out of which a fiery stream issues ([link]Dan. 7:9-10[/link]). The flame of God's judging fire sweeps all negative things in the entire universe into this glassy sea, which eventually becomes the lake of fire ([link]20:14[/link]). The glassy sea, being the aggregate of all God's fiery judgment, is like crystal, signifying that every negative thing under God's judgment is crystal clear. Here we have the rainbow around the throne of God, signifying that God will keep His promise recorded in [link]Gen. 9:8-17[/link]. We also have the glassy sea of fire, indicating that God will judge all negative things still with fire.</note>
        <note num="2">The twenty-four elders around the throne of God represent all the angels, whereas the four living creatures represent all other living creatures. The first, which is like a lion, represents the beasts; the second, which is like a calf, represents the cattle; the third, which is like a man, represents mankind; and the fourth, which is like an eagle, represents the fowl ([link]v. 7[/link]). Of the six categories of living things created by God ([link]Gen. 1:20-28[/link]), two are not represented here &amp;#8212; the creeping things on the earth and the living things in the water. The head of the creeping things is the serpent, a symbol of God's enemy, Satan, who will be cast into the lake of fire and will have no place in the new heaven and new earth. The living things in the water are in the water of God's judgment, which will no longer exist in the new heaven and new earth ([link]21:1[/link]). Hence, for eternity these two categories are not represented before God.[br][br]Among the four living creatures, the calf is clean, but the lion and the eagle are unclean ([link]Lev. 11:3[/link], [link]27[/link], [link]13-19[/link]). After being redeemed, they all became clean ([link]Acts 10:11-16[/link]). Among them the calf and the man are meek and gentle, but the lion and eagle are wild and fierce. Through redemption they can all dwell together ([link]Isa. 11:6-9[/link]). Christ's redemption is not only for man but for all things ([link]Col. 1:20[/link]), for He died on behalf of everything ([link]Heb. 2:9[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">In [link]ch. 4[/link] is the scene in the heavens, its center being the throne of God, on which God sits, ready to execute His universal administration for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose. Here in [link]ch. 5[/link] is the same scene in the heavens after Christ ascended there. He was recommended to the apostle John as the Lion of the tribe of Judah by one of the elders, but He appeared to John as a Lamb. As the Lion, He is the Fighter against the enemy; as the Lamb, He is the Redeemer for us. He fought to redeem us, and He won the battle over the enemy and accomplished redemption for us. To the enemy He is a Lion; to us He is a Lamb. Hence, He is the Lion-Lamb.</note>
        <note num="2">As far as redemption is concerned, Christ sat down at the right hand of God in the heavens after His ascension ([link]Heb. 1:3[/link]; [link]10:12[/link]), whereas regarding the carrying out of God's administration, He is still standing in His ascension.</note>
        <note num="3">[i]Having just been slain[/i] indicates that the Lamb had just been slain and also that the scene in the heavens that is depicted in this chapter took place immediately after Christ's ascension into the heavens.</note>
        <note num="4">Horns signify strength in fighting ([link]Deut. 33:17[/link]). Christ is the redeeming Lamb, yet He has horns for fighting. He is the fighting Redeemer. His fighting is complete (perfect and complete) in God's move, as signified by the number seven.</note>
        <note num="5">Eyes are for observing and searching. Christ as the redeeming Lamb has seven observing and searching eyes for executing God's judgment upon the universe to fulfill God's eternal purpose, which will consummate in the building up of the New Jerusalem. Therefore, in [link]Zech. 3:9[/link] He is prophesied as the stone, the topstone ([link]Zech. 4:7[/link]) with seven eyes for God's building. These seven eyes are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth, and they run to and fro through the whole earth ([link]Zech. 4:10[/link]).

According to historical facts, the rider of the first horse, the white horse, must be the gospel, not Christ or Antichrist as some interpret. Immediately after Christ's ascension, these four things &amp;#8212; the gospel, war, famine, and death &amp;#8212; began to run like riders on four horses, and they will continue until Christ comes back.

Hence, both four plus three and six plus one indicate that the seven seals, through God's judgment, bring God's creation, with all the creatures, to God.[br][br]The fifth seal discloses Christian martyrdom from the first century to the time near the end of this age.

To be on the cloud is to come openly, whereas to be clothed with a cloud is to come secretly. This indicates that even after the sixth trumpet, Christ still is coming secretly, not openly.

        <note num="1">The writer of this book not only received but also devoured the scroll. To devour anything is to receive it into one's being.

        <note num="2">The prophecy of this book is composed of two sections. From the first seal to the sixth trumpet ([link]chs. 6-10[/link]) is the first section; it is in secret. From the seventh trumpet to the new heaven and new earth ([link]chs. 11-22[/link]) is the second section; it is openly manifested. John prophesied in the first section. He must prophesy [i]again,[/i] that is, prophesy in the second section of the prophecy of this book, the section that concerns Christ's coming to possess the earth as His kingdom ([link]11:15[/link]).

        <note num="2">Since [i]for the dead to be judged[/i] is mentioned before [i]to give the reward to Your slaves[/i]..., the former must not refer to the judgment of the dead at the great white throne after the millennium ([link]Rev. 20:11-15[/link]). Rather, it refers to the fact that at the close of this age, before the millennium, according to [link]John 5:27-29[/link], the dead will be judged concerning who should share in the resurrection of life before the millennium ([link]1 Cor. 15:23[/link]; [link]Rev. 20:4-6[/link]) and who should be left to the resurrection of condemnation after the millennium ([link]Rev. 20:11-12[/link]).</note>

        <note num="4">Those who fear God's name are the "sheep" mentioned in [link]Matt. 25:33-40[/link].

During the great tribulation they will care for the Lord's needy people, His little brothers (the believers who suffer persecution and the Jews who fear God).

        <text>And a great [xref]a[/xref]sign was seen in heaven: a [note]1[/note][xref]b[/xref]woman clothed with the [xref]c[/xref]sun, and the moon underneath her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars;</text>
        <note num="1">The first section of this book, composed of the first eleven chapters, covers all things that occur from Christ's ascension to eternity. The second section, composed of the last eleven chapters, gives details of the important things and crucial matters occurring from the last three and a half years of the present age, which will be the period of the great tribulation, to the eternal age of the new heaven and new earth. The first of the important things and crucial matters revealed in this section is a woman who brought forth a man-child.[br][br]This woman is "clothed with the sun, and the moon underneath her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars." In [link]Gen. 37:9[/link], Joseph in his dream saw the sun, the moon, and the eleven stars, signifying his father, his mother, and his eleven brothers. There the sun, the moon, and the eleven stars, plus Joseph himself, signified the totality of God's people on the earth. Based on the principle of that dream, the sun, the moon, and the twelve stars here must signify the totality of God's people on earth, which is symbolized here by a woman. Most of her being is clothed with the sun. The sun signifies God's people in the New Testament age. Before Christ came to the world, it was the dark night of the Old Testament age. When Christ as the rising sun came from on high ([link]Luke 1:78[/link]), the age of the sun came. Before that, it was the age of the moon, which signifies God's people in the Old Testament time. The moon is underneath the feet of the woman, for the age of the moon was the age of the law, which should not be exalted as the stars are. The stars, which signify the patriarchs, God's people before the law was given, are on her head as a crown. All God's people in these three ages, who together constitute this woman, are light bearers. Hence, she is the bright woman shining throughout all generations.</note>

        <note num="1">The child here, being a man-child ([link]v. 5[/link]), signifies the stronger part of God's people. Throughout all generations there are some stronger ones among God's people.

        <note num="1">The dragon signifies Satan ([link]v. 9[/link]). In [link]Gen. 3[/link] Satan was a serpent, a smaller creature, a subtle one. Here he has become a dragon, much larger than a serpent and cruel. Hence, he is called "a great red dragon." Red here signifies the shedding of blood caused by Satan's murders ([link]John 8:44[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">The seven heads and ten horns are those of the beast, Antichrist ([link]13:1[/link]). This indicates that the dragon and the beast are one and shows that Antichrist is the embodiment of Satan.</note>
        <note num="3">The seven diadems indicate the glory of the seven Caesars' extraordinary kingship. Since each of these seven Caesars was one with Satan, each assumed deity, claimed to be God, and forced the people to worship him as God.</note>

        <note num="1">The stars of heaven here signify the angels ([link]Job 38:7[/link]; [link]Isa. 14:12[/link]). The third part of the stars of heaven must be the fallen angels, who followed Satan in his rebellion against God. Satan drags all of them away, and as the angels of Satan they will be cast to the earth with Satan ([link]v. 9[/link]). Hence, at that time the earth will be filled with these fallen angels, who will damage the dwelling place of the people who rebel against God. The earth will thus become a dreadful place.</note>
        <note num="2">That the dragon stood before the woman signifies that Satan is always against the people of God, opposing them. From the time of [link]Gen. 3:15[/link] to this day, Satan, the ancient serpent, has been fighting continually against the woman with the intention of devouring her child.</note>

        <note num="1">[i]Brought forth[/i] here signifies resurrection, as in [link]Acts 13:33-34[/link]. The man-child is composed of the overcoming saints who have died and been resurrected. This is proved by the words [i]unto death[/i] in [link]v. 11[/link].</note>
        <note num="2">In the Bible, woman signifies the weaker one and man the stronger one ([link]1 Pet. 3:7[/link]). Hence, the man-child here signifies the stronger part of God's people. That the man-child is to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod indicates that the man-child consists of the overcomers, as mentioned in [link]2:26-27[/link].</note>
        <note num="3">See note [link]17[sup]1[/sup] in 1 Thes. 4[/link]. To be caught up is to be raptured. The rapture of the man-child differs from that of the majority of the believers, which is mentioned in [link]1 Thes. 4:17[/link]. There, the majority of the believers are raptured (1) to the air, and (2) at the last trumpet ([link]1 Cor. 15:52[/link]; [link]1 Thes. 4:16[/link]), which is the seventh trumpet ([link]11:15[/link]). But here, the man-child is raptured (1) to the throne of God, and (2) before the one thousand two hundred and sixty days, which is the time of the great tribulation of three and a half years (forty-two months, [link]v. 14[/link]; [link]13:5[/link]; [link]11:2[/link]), beginning from the sixth seal, before the fifth trumpet ([link]9:1[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">After the rapture of the man-child, the woman is left on earth to suffer persecution ([link]v. 13[/link]). During the time of the great tribulation, God will prepare a place where she can be nourished for a thousand two hundred and sixty days before He brings His people into the millennial kingdom. (This is similar to the time when Pharaoh persecuted the children of Israel and God brought His people to the wilderness, where He nourished them before bringing them into the good land.) That the woman (the remaining and living majority of the believers) will be preserved and nourished by God for a thousand two hundred and sixty days during the great tribulation is a strong proof that their rapture will take place on the last day of the three and a half years of the great tribulation, that is, the last day of the one thousand two hundred and sixty days.</note>

        <note num="1">Immediately after the man-child is raptured to heaven, Michael and his angels begin to war against Satan.

Heaven is waiting for them to arrive that a war may be waged to cast Satan out of heaven.</note>

The coming of the kingdom has two aspects: the reality of the kingdom ([link]Matt. 5:3[/link]), which is in the proper church life today ([link]Rom. 14:17[/link]), and the manifestation of the kingdom in the millennium, which will be brought in through the overcoming believers.[br][br]When the manifestation of the kingdom comes, the salvation of God will come in full with the kingdom.

        <note num="1">This beast, the fourth beast mentioned in [link]Dan. 7:7[/link], is Antichrist. In [link]9:11[/link] he is the king of the locusts.</note>
        <note num="2">The sea here is the Mediterranean Sea, out of which Antichrist will come. In [link]9:11[/link], [link]11:7[/link], and [link]17:8[/link] we are told that Antichrist will come up out of the abyss. Here we are told that he will come up out of the sea, as is mentioned also in [link]Dan. 7:3[/link]. This indicates that Antichrist will come from two sources. His spirit, which exists in the abyss before he is born, will come up out of the abyss. (See notes [link chapter="17"]8[sup]1[/sup][/link], [link]10[sup]1[/sup][/link], and [link]11[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 17[/link].) His body will come from one of the Gentile nations around the Mediterranean Sea. In biblical figure, the land signifies the nation of Israel and the sea signifies the Gentile nations ([link]17:15[/link]; [link]Isa. 57:20[/link]).[br][br]That Antichrist will come up out of both the abyss and the sea may indicate also that the sea is the mouth of the abyss, because the abyss is in the heart of the earth ([link]Rom. 10:7[/link]; [link]Matt. 12:40[/link]) and the sea is above the earth.</note>
        <note num="3">The ten horns and seven heads of the beast are those of the dragon ([link]12:3[/link]). This indicates that the beast is one with the dragon. The ten horns are the ten coming kings ([link]17:12[/link]; [link]Dan. 7:24[/link]); the seven heads are the seven Caesars ([link]17:10[/link]). The ten horns correspond with the ten toes of the great image mentioned in [link]Dan. 2:42-44[/link]. The word here indicates that the Roman Empire, Antichrist, and the ten kings are one with Satan.</note>
        <note num="4">The seven Caesars symbolized by the seven heads of the beast claimed deity and called for their people to worship them as gods. That was truly a blasphemy against God.</note>

        <note num="1">The beast, Antichrist, is "like a leopard, and his feet like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion." According to [link]Dan. 7:4-6[/link], the leopard, which is characterized by swift and cruel movement, was the symbol of Alexander the Great, the king of Greece. The bear, characterized by its destroying feet, was the symbol of the monarchy of Medo-Persia. The lion, characterized by its devouring mouth, was a symbol of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon. Since Antichrist, the beast, is like these three, he will have all their characteristics, as mentioned in [link]Dan. 7:4-7[/link]. He is the totality of all the evil powers in human history.</note>
        <note num="2">That the dragon gives his power, his throne, and great authority to the beast indicates that he makes the beast one with him so that on behalf of the dragon the beast can resist God and persecute God's people on the earth.</note>

Only man is privileged to preach the gospel of grace on the earth today ([link]Acts 10:3-6[/link]). But the eternal gospel will be preached by the angel in the air at the close of this age.</note>

        <note num="1">"Fear God and give Him glory" is a commandment given to those who dwell on the earth.

All the people of the nations who remain at the Lord's coming back to earth will be judged according to the eternal gospel preached by the angel during the great tribulation ([link]Matt. 24:21[/link]). If in fearing and worshipping God they have treated well the Christians and Jews, the Lord's brothers suffering poverty and imprisonment under Antichrist's persecution during the great tribulation, they will be justified by the Lord so that they can enter into the earthly part of the millennium to partake of the kingdom prepared by God for them from the foundation of the world ([link]Matt. 25:34[/link]).

The fornication of the apostate church consists of her having sinful relationships with the kings of the earth for her profit, just as a harlot commits sin for gain. Hers is spiritual fornication.

        <note num="1">Purple signifies dignity with authority ([link]John 19:2-3[/link]). The color purple is a blend of blue and red; it signifies the blending of heavenly things with earthly. This is the appearance of the apostate church.</note>

        <note num="1">[i]Mystery[/i] here indicates that Babylon the Great in this chapter is not the material Babylon in [link]ch. 18[/link] but the religious one. The religious Babylon, the apostate church, is truly mysterious in what she is, in what she practices, and in what she teaches.</note>

The first five "have fallen"; i.e., they died unnaturally ([link]Judg. 3:25[/link]; [link]2 Sam. 1:10[/link], [link]25[/link], [link]27[/link]). Those five are Julius Caesar, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero, all of whom either were murdered or committed suicide before John wrote this book. The sixth, Domitian, who was also murdered, was living when this book was written; therefore, it is said of him that he "is." "The other," the seventh, is Antichrist; he had "not yet come" at that time. When he comes, he will remain only a short time and then will be slain and will be resuscitated by the spirit of the fifth, who is Nero, to become the eighth.</note>

In that resuscitation the spirit of Nero (the fifth Caesar), which will come up out of the abyss (when Satan is cast down to the earth &amp;#8212; [link]12:10[/link], [link]13[/link]), will animate and resuscitate the dead body of the seventh Caesar, Antichrist, thereby imitating the resurrection of Christ. This one, composed of the fifth and seventh Caesars, is the eighth. Hence, he is "out of the seven," having the body of the seventh and the spirit of the fifth. Therefore, he will be all the more capable, all the more intelligent, and all the more powerful to charm, deceive, and allure people, capturing those who do not believe in Christ. It is no wonder that people will marvel at the sight of such an extraordinary person and will follow him ([link]v. 8[/link]; [link]13:3[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">After the rapture of the majority of the saints ([link]14:16[/link]; [link]1 Thes. 4:15-17[/link]) and the judgment at the judgment seat of Christ for the giving of the reward ([link]11:18[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 5:10[/link]), the events that immediately follow should be the marriage of the Lamb, and then the destruction of Antichrist and Babylon the Great ([link]19:19-21[/link]; [link]18:1-19:4[/link]), which bring in the reign of God &amp;#8212; the kingdom of God ([link]v. 6[/link]). For this reason, the great multitude of the saved rejoice and praise with hallelujahs ([link]vv. 1[/link], [link]3[/link], [link]6[/link]), and the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures join them in praising God ([link]v. 4[/link]).[br][br]The reign of God, the kingdom, is related to the marriage of the Lamb, and the marriage of the Lamb is the issue of the completion of God's New Testament economy. God's economy in the New Testament is to obtain for Christ a bride, the church, through His redemption and divine life. By the continual working of the Holy Spirit through all the centuries, this goal will be attained at the end of this age. Then the bride, the overcoming believers, will be ready, and the kingdom of God will come. This corresponds with the Lord's prophecy in [link]Matt. 26:29[/link].</note>
        <note num="2">[i]His wife[/i] refers to the church ([link]Eph. 5:24-25[/link], [link]31-32[/link]), the bride of Christ ([link]John 3:29[/link]). However, according to [link]vv. 8-9[/link], the wife, the bride of Christ, here consists only of the overcoming believers during the millennium; whereas the bride, the wife, in [link]21:2[/link] is composed of all the saved saints after the millennium for eternity. The readiness of the bride depends on the maturity in life of the overcomers. Furthermore, the overcomers are not separate individuals but a corporate bride. For this aspect, building is needed. The overcomers not only are mature in life but also are built together as one bride.</note>

        <note num="1">The marriage dinner of the Lamb here is the wedding feast in [link]Matt. 22:2[/link]. It will be a reward to the overcoming believers. Only the overcomers will be called to it; not all the saved ones will participate in it. The five foolish virgins in [link]Matt. 25:8-13[/link] will miss it. However, after being dealt with by the Lord in the kingdom age, they will participate in the New Jerusalem for eternity. Hence, to be called to the marriage dinner of Christ, which will usher the overcoming believers into the enjoyment of the millennium, is to be blessed. The overcoming believers, who will be called to the marriage dinner of the Lamb, will also be the bride of the Lamb.</note>

This may indicate that in mankind's last rebellion against God, which will be instigated by Satan, Gog and Magog will take the lead and the nations will follow.</note>
        <note num="2">This will be the last war on earth. It will be caused by mankind's last rebellion, which will be instigated by Satan, God's enemy, after the millennium. Although mankind will be in a restored state for one thousand years, man's rebellious nature will still remain. It will be exposed by Satan's last instigation and will be purged away by the Lord's final judgment on mankind.</note>

        <note num="1">In eternity past God purposed to have a corporate expression that He might be fully expressed and glorified ([link]Eph. 3:9-11[/link]; [link]1:9-12[/link]). For this, He created the heavens, the earth, and mankind. After the creation of the world, there are four dispensations: the dispensation of the patriarchs, from Adam to Moses ([link]Rom. 5:14[/link]); the dispensation of law, from Moses to Christ ([link]John 1:17[/link]); the dispensation of grace, from Christ's first coming to the restoration of all things at Christ's second coming ([link]Acts 3:20-21[/link]); and the dispensation of the kingdom, from Christ's second coming to the end of the millennium ([link]11:15[/link]; [link]20:4[/link], [link]6[/link]). God uses these four dispensations to perfect and complete His chosen people that they may be His eternal corporate expression for the accomplishing of His purpose. All four dispensations belong to the old heaven and old earth. Although the dispensation of the kingdom is the dispensation of restoration, it still will take place in the old heaven and old earth, because God's perfecting and completing work in His chosen people will not be finished until the end of that dispensation. When God finishes this work through the dispensation of the kingdom, the old heaven and old earth will pass away through fire and be renewed to become the new heaven and new earth ([link]2 Pet. 3:10-13[/link]), into which the New Jerusalem will come to be God's eternal expression.</note>
        <note num="2">According to the principle revealed in the Bible, God does not want the first, whether man or thing ([link]Exo. 12:12[/link]), but the second. Hence, whatever is the first, whether heaven, earth, man, or thing, will be annulled ([link]v. 4[/link]; cf. [link]1 Cor. 15:47[/link]; [link]Heb. 8:7[/link], [link]13[/link]). If the Greek word for [i]first[/i] is rendered [i]former,[/i] the spiritual significance is missed.</note>
        <note num="3">The sea is a result of the waters of judgment, which God used to judge the preadamic world (see [i]Life-study of Genesis,[/i] Message Two). The work of God's re-creation was to recover the land by restricting the result of the waters of judgment ([link]Gen. 1:9-10[/link]; [link]Jer. 5:22[/link]). The living creatures of the preadamic world, after being judged by the waters, became the sea's inhabitants, the demons. After they have been dealt with by Christ and His believers ([link]Matt. 8:29-32[/link]; [link]Luke 10:17[/link]; [link]Acts 16:16-18[/link]; [link]19:12[/link]) and the sea has given them up to the judgment of the great white throne ([link]20:13[/link]), the sea will not be needed. Since the work of God's re-creation, God's intention has been to abolish the sea by dealing with Satan and his demons. Hence, [i]the sea is no more[/i] indicates that Satan and his evil followers will all be dealt with and will not be found in the new heaven and new earth.</note>

        <note num="1">The revelation of this book is composed of signs (see note [link]1[sup]2[/sup] in ch. 1[/link]). Because of the profundity of the great and important matters in this book, it is difficult for man to speak of them exhaustively in plain words. Thus, all these matters are symbolized and depicted by signs, such as the lampstands, signifying the churches, and stars, signifying the messengers of the churches ([link]ch. 1[/link]); Jezebel, signifying the degraded, fornicating Roman Church ([link]ch. 2b[/link]); jasper and precious stones, signifying life and the redeeming God ([link]4:3[/link]); the Lion and the Lamb, signifying the overcoming and redeeming Christ ([link]ch. 5[/link]); the four horses, signifying the gospel, war, famine, and the spreading abroad of death ([link]ch. 6a[/link]); the universal woman, signifying God's redeemed throughout the generations, her child, signifying the strong, overcoming ones among God's redeemed, and the dragon, the serpent, signifying the cruel and subtle Satan, the devil ([link]ch. 12[/link]); the beast out of the sea, signifying Antichrist, and the beast out of the earth, signifying the false prophet ([link]ch. 13[/link]); the harvest, signifying the people growing under God's cultivation, and the firstfruits, signifying the ones who ripen early among those who are growing under God's cultivation ([link]ch. 14[/link]); Babylon the Great, signifying Rome, in both its religious aspect and its material aspect ([link]chs. 17-18[/link]); and the bride, signifying the saints who are mature and are prepared to be Christ's counterpart (ch. 19a). Besides these, there are many other signs. The final sign, which is also the greatest, is the New Jerusalem, signifying the composition of the totality of God's redeemed saints throughout the generations, who have been regenerated, transformed, and glorified. It is not a material, lifeless city but a corporate living person as the bride, having Christ, such a wonderful person, as her husband ([link]v. 2[/link]).[br][br]The New Jerusalem is a living composition of all the saints redeemed by God throughout all generations. It is the bride of Christ as His counterpart ([link]John 3:29[/link]) and the holy city of God as His habitation, His tabernacle ([link]v. 3[/link]). This is the heavenly Jerusalem ([link]Heb. 12:22[/link]), which God has prepared for us and which Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob long after ([link]Heb. 11:10[/link], [link]16[/link]). This is also the Jerusalem which is above and which is our mother ([link]Gal. 4:26[/link]). As the bride of Christ, the New Jerusalem comes out of Christ, her Husband, and becomes His counterpart, just as Eve came out of Adam, her husband, and became his counterpart ([link]Gen. 2:21-24[/link]). She is prepared by participating in the riches of the life and nature of Christ. As the holy city of God, she is wholly sanctified unto God and fully saturated with God's holy nature to be His habitation.[br][br]In both the Old Testament and the New Testament, God likens His chosen people to a spouse ([link]Isa. 54:6[/link]; [link]Jer. 3:1[/link]; [link]Ezek. 16:8[/link]; [link]Hosea 2:19[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 11:2[/link]; [link]Eph. 5:31-32[/link]) and a dwelling place for Himself ([link]Exo. 29:45-46[/link]; [link]Num. 5:3[/link]; [link]Ezek. 43:7[/link], [link]9[/link]; [link]Psa. 68:18[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 3:16-17[/link]; [link]6:19[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 6:16[/link]; [link]1 Tim. 3:15[/link]). The spouse is for His satisfaction in love, and the dwelling place is for His rest in expression. Both of these aspects will be ultimately consummated in the New Jerusalem. In her, God will have the fullest satisfaction in love and the utmost rest in expression for eternity.</note>
        <note num="2">After all God's redeemed saints are raptured to the heavens, they will constitute the New Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from God. This indicates that our dwelling place for eternity will not be heaven but the New Jerusalem on the new earth.</note>
        <note num="3">The New Jerusalem is a bride, indicating that she is not a material city but a corporate person. To Christ she is a bride for His satisfaction; to God she is a tabernacle in which He can rest and through which He can express Himself.</note>

        <note num="1">The New Jerusalem is a city of foundations ([link]Heb. 11:10[/link]). These are the twelve apostles of the Lamb ([link]v. 14[/link]), each of whom is signified by a precious stone. Peter, the first of the twelve apostles, was originally named Simon. When Simon was brought to the Lord, the Lord changed his name to Peter, meaning [i]a stone[/i] ([link]John 1:42[/link]). Later, the Lord called him by that name when He spoke concerning the building of His church ([link]Matt. 16:18[/link]). Precious stones are not created but are produced by the transforming of things created. All the apostles were created as clay, but they were regenerated and were transformed into precious stones for God's eternal building. Every believer needs to be thus regenerated and transformed that he may be a part of the New Jerusalem.[br][br]The colors of the foundation's twelve precious stones, which signify the twelve apostles, are as follows: the first stone is green, the second and third are blue, the fourth is green, the fifth and sixth are red, the seventh is yellow, the eighth is bluish green, the ninth is yellow, the tenth is apple-green, the eleventh and twelfth are purple. The twelve layers of the foundation in the above colors have the appearance of a rainbow, signifying that the city is built upon and secured by God's faithfulness in keeping His covenant ([link]Gen. 9:8-17[/link]) and that the foundation of the city is trustworthy and reliable.</note>
        <note num="2">The first layer of the wall's foundation, as well as the entire wall of New Jerusalem, is built with jasper ([link]v. 18[/link]). This indicates that the main material in the building of the holy city is jasper. Since jasper signifies God expressed in His transmittable glory ([link]4:3[/link]), the main function of the holy city is to express God in bearing His glory ([link]v. 11[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">Pearls are produced by oysters in the waters of death. When an oyster is wounded by a grain of sand, it secretes its life-juice around the grain of sand and makes it into a precious pearl. This depicts Christ as the living One coming into the death waters, being wounded by us, and secreting His life over us to make us into precious pearls for the building of God's eternal expression. That the twelve gates of the holy city are twelve pearls signifies that regeneration through the death-overcoming and life-secreting Christ is the entrance into the city. This meets the requirement of the law, which is represented by Israel and is under the observing of the guarding angels ([link]v. 12[/link]).[br][br]The New Jerusalem is built of three kinds of precious materials, signifying that she is built with the Triune God. First, the city proper, with its street, is of pure gold ([link]vv. 18[/link], [link]21[/link]). Gold, the symbol of the divine nature of God, signifies the Father as the source, from whom the element for the substantial existence of the city is produced. Second, the twelve gates of the city are pearls, which signify the Son's overcoming death and life-imparting resurrection, through which entrance to the city is gained. Third, the wall of the city and its foundation are built of precious stones, signifying the Spirit's work of transforming the redeemed and regenerated saints into precious stones for the building of God's eternal habitation that they may express God corporately in His all-permeating glory. In the garden of Eden these three kinds of treasures merely existed as materials ([link]Gen. 2:11-12[/link]), whereas in the city of New Jerusalem these precious materials become a builded city for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose, which is to have a corporate expression.</note>
        <note num="2">Each gate of the holy city is one pearl, signifying that the entrance to the city is unique and is once for all; that is, we can enter the city only through the once-for-all regeneration accomplished by Christ's overcoming death and life-imparting resurrection.</note>
        <note num="3">The gates are for the entrance into the city, whereas the street is for the daily walk, the daily living, in the city. The entrance into the city is through Christ's death and resurrection, whereas the daily walk, the daily living, in the city is according to the divine nature of God, signified by the street being of pure gold. After the saints enter through regeneration, they must daily live and walk in God's divine nature as the way. The divine nature of God is their pathway.</note>
        <note num="4">The pure gold, which symbolizes the street and the city proper of the New Jerusalem, is like clear glass ([link]v. 18[/link]), signifying that the whole city is transparent. Although the pearls may be opaque, every one of them is a great open gate, which will not be shut by day or by night ([link]v. 25[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">At the end of this age a great part of the inhabitants of the earth will be killed as a result of the sixth and seventh trumpets. The rest will be judged by Christ at the throne of His glory when He comes back to earth. The condemned ones, the "goats," will be cursed and will perish in the lake of fire, while the justified ones, the "sheep," will be blessed and will inherit the kingdom prepared for them from the foundation of the world ([link]Matt. 25:31-46[/link]). Unlike the New Testament believers, the "sheep" will not be saved and regenerated; they will only be restored to the original state of man as he was created by God. They will be the nations as citizens of the millennial kingdom, in which the overcoming believers will be the kings ([link]20:4[/link], [link]6[/link]) and the saved remnant of Israel will be the priests ([link]Zech. 8:20-23[/link]). After the millennial kingdom, a part of these nations, deceived by the devil, will rebel against the Lord and will be consumed by fire from heaven ([link]20:7-9[/link]). The rest will be transferred to the new earth to be the nations, which will live around the New Jerusalem and walk by its light. They will be the peoples mentioned in [link]vv. 3[/link] and [link]4[/link]. They, as created but unregenerated men, will be maintained to live forever in their created state through the healing of the leaves of the tree of life ([link]22:2[/link]). Even for them there will be no more death ([link]v. 4[/link]). Under the shining of the New Jerusalem with the divine glory, neither will they be in darkness.</note>

It is one river, flowing to the four corners of the holy city, like the one river in [link]Gen. 2:10-14[/link], which parts into four heads. As indicated in [link]John 7:38[/link], this one river with its riches becomes many rivers in our experience of the different aspects of the riches of God's Spirit of life ([link]Rom. 8:2[/link]; [link]15:30[/link]; [link]1 Thes. 1:6[/link]; [link]2 Thes. 2:13[/link]; [link]Gal. 5:22-23[/link]).</note>
        <note num="3">The water of life is a symbol of God in Christ as the Spirit flowing Himself into His redeemed people to be their life and life supply. It is typified by the water that came out of the riven rock ([link]Exo. 17:6[/link]; [link]Num. 20:11[/link]) and symbolized by the water that flowed out of the pierced side of the Lord Jesus ([link]John 19:34[/link]). Here, the water of life becomes a river, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb to supply and saturate the entire New Jerusalem. Thus this city is filled with the divine life that it may express God in His glory of life.</note>
        <note num="4">The water of life is bright as crystal, having no dimness or opaqueness. When this water of life flows in us, it purifies us and makes us as transparent as crystal.</note>
        <note num="5">[i]The throne of God and of the Lamb,[/i] showing that there is one throne for both God and the Lamb, indicates that God and the Lamb are one &amp;#8212; the Lamb-God, the redeeming God, God the Redeemer. In eternity the very God who sits on the throne is our redeeming God, from whose throne proceeds the river of water of life for our supply and satisfaction. This depicts how the Triune God &amp;#8212; God, the Lamb, and the Spirit, who is symbolized by the water of life &amp;#8212; dispenses Himself to His redeemed under His headship (implied in the authority of the throne) for eternity.</note>
        <note num="6">The street of the holy city is pure gold ([link]21:21[/link]). Gold symbolizes the divine nature. That the river of water of life proceeds "in the middle of its street" signifies that the divine life flows in the divine nature as the unique way for the daily life of God's redeemed people. Where the divine life flows, there the divine nature is as the holy way by which God's people walk; and where the holy way of the divine nature is, there the divine life is flowing. The divine life and the divine nature as the holy way always go together. Thus, God's river of water of life is available along this divine way, and we enjoy the river by walking in this way of life.</note>

        <text>And on this [xref]a[/xref]side and on that side of the river was the [note]1[/note][xref]b[/xref]tree of life, producing twelve [note]2[/note][xref]c[/xref]fruits, yielding its fruit [note]3[/note]each [note]4[/note]month; and the [note]5[/note][xref]d[/xref]leaves of the tree are for the [xref]e[/xref]healing of the [xref]f[/xref]nations.</text>
        <note num="1">That the one tree of life grows on the two sides of the river signifies that the tree of life is a vine that spreads and proceeds along the flow of the water of life for God's people to receive and enjoy. This tree fulfills for eternity what God intended from the beginning ([link]Gen. 2:9[/link]). The tree of life was closed to man because of his fall ([link]Gen. 3:22-24[/link]), but it was opened to the believers through the redemption of Christ ([link]Heb. 10:19-20[/link]). Today the enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life is the believers' common portion ([link]John 6:35[/link], [link]57[/link]). In the millennial kingdom the enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life will be a dispensational reward to the overcoming believers ([link]2:7[/link]). Eventually, in the new heaven and new earth for eternity, the enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life will be the eternal portion of all God's redeemed ([link]vv. 14[/link], [link]19[/link]). Christ as the tree of life is the life supply available along the flow of the Spirit as the water of life. Where the Spirit flows, there the life supply of Christ is found. This is all in and with the divine nature as our holy way, signified by the street. This is the supply of the holy city, and this is the way the city is supplied.</note>
        <note num="2">The fruits of the tree of life will be the food of God's redeemed for eternity. They will be continually fresh, being produced every month, twelve fruits yearly. That the tree of life bears twelve fruits means that the fruit of the tree of life is rich and is sufficient for the carrying out of God's eternal administration.</note>
        <note num="3">Lit., according to each month.</note>
        <note num="4">[i]Month[/i] indicates that in the new heaven and new earth the moon still will be there to divide the twelve months. The sun also will be there to separate day and night into periods of twelve hours each. While the number that represents the church is seven, signifying that God in His present dispensation is added to His creature, man, the number that represents the New Jerusalem is twelve, signifying that God in His eternal administration is mingled with His creature, man. In the New Jerusalem are the twelve foundations, inscribed with the names of the twelve apostles; the twelve gates, which are twelve pearls, inscribed with the names of the twelve tribes; and the twelve fruits of the tree of life. With regard to space, the city proper is twelve thousand stadia, one thousand times twelve, in each of its three dimensions, and its wall is one hundred forty-four cubits, twelve times twelve, in height. With regard to time, in the new heaven and new earth there are twelve months yearly, twelve hours daily, and twelve hours nightly.</note>
        <note num="5">The leaves of the tree of life are for the healing of the nations. In the Bible, leaves are a symbol of man's deeds ([link]Gen. 3:7[/link]). The leaves of the tree of life symbolize the deeds of Christ. The regenerated believers eat the fruit of the tree of life, receiving Christ as their inward life and life supply, that they may enjoy the divine life for eternity, whereas the restored nations are healed by the leaves of the tree of life, taking the deeds of Christ as their outward guide and regulation, that they may live the human life forever.</note>

        <note num="1">This verse can be considered a promise of the enjoyment of the tree of life, which is Christ with all the riches of life; and the second half of [link]v. 17[/link] can be considered a call to take the water of life, which is the life-giving Spirit. Thus this book ends in a promise and a call, both of which are for eating and drinking the all-inclusive Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</note>
        <note num="2">The robes here symbolize the conduct of the believers. To wash their robes is to keep their conduct clean through the washing of the blood of the Lamb ([link]7:14[/link]; [link]1 John 1:7[/link]). This gives them the right to participate in the tree of life and to enter into the city. Both the tree of life and the city will be an enjoyment to them in eternity.</note>
        <note num="3">Lit., their authority will be over the tree of life and they may enter...</note>
        <note num="4">After being created, man was put before the tree of life ([link]Gen. 2:8-9[/link]), indicating that he was privileged to partake of it. But because of the fall of man, the way to the tree of life was closed to man by God's glory, holiness, and righteousness ([link]Gen. 3:24[/link]). Through Christ's redemption, which fulfilled all the requirements of God's glory, holiness, and righteousness, the way to the tree of life was opened again to believers ([link]Heb. 10:19-20[/link]). Hence, those who wash their robes in the redeeming blood of Christ have the right to enjoy the tree of life as their eternal portion in the holy city, the Paradise of God, in eternity ([link]2:7[/link]).</note>
        <note num="5">To enter by the gates into the city is to enter the New Jerusalem, as a realm of God's eternal blessing, by regeneration through the death-overcoming and life-imparting Christ. (See note [link]21[sup]2[/sup] in ch. 21[/link].)</note>

        <note num="3">In His divinity, Christ is the Root, the source, of David; in His humanity, Christ is the Offspring, the issue, of David. Hence, He is the Lord as the Root of David, and He is also the son, the shoot, of David as the Offspring of David ([link]Matt. 22:42-45[/link]; [link]Rom. 1:3[/link]; [link]Jer. 23:5[/link]).</note>
        <note num="4">At His coming back Christ will be the rising sun to His people generally ([link]Mal. 4:2[/link]) but the morning star to His watching lovers particularly. The latter will be a reward to the overcomers ([link]2:28[/link]). Christ's being the Root and Offspring of David is related to Israel and the kingdom, whereas Christ's being the bright morning star is related to the church and the rapture. The morning star appears before the darkest hour, prior to the dawn. The great tribulation will be this darkest time, after which the day of the kingdom will dawn. In the kingdom the Lord will appear publicly to His people as the sun, but before the great tribulation He will appear privately to His overcomers as the morning star.</note>

        <note num="1">In [link]chs. 2[/link] and [link book="Rev."]3[/link] it was the Spirit speaking to the churches; here, at the end of the book, it is the Spirit and the bride, the church, speaking together as one. This indicates that the church's experience of the Spirit has improved to the extent that she has become one with the Spirit, who is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God.[br][br]The entire revelation of the Bible shows us the love story of a universal couple. That is, the sovereign Lord, who created the universe and all things, the Triune God &amp;#8212; the Father, the Son, and the Spirit &amp;#8212; who went through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, and who ultimately became the life-giving Spirit, is joined in marriage to the created, redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite man &amp;#8212; composed of spirit, soul, and body &amp;#8212; who ultimately constitutes the church, the expression of God. In the eternity that is without end, by the divine, eternal, and surpassingly glorious life, they will live a life that is the mingling of God and man as one spirit, a life that is superexcellent and that overflows with blessings and joy.</note>
        <note num="2">"Come!" is the response of the Spirit and the bride to the Lord's word in [link]v. 16[/link] and to His repeated warning in [link]vv. 7[/link] and [link]12[/link]. It expresses the desire for the Lord's coming. Whoever hears this response also should say, "Come!" thus expressing a joint desire for the Lord's coming. All believers who love the Lord's appearing ([link]2 Tim. 4:8[/link]) should express such a joint desire.</note>
        <note num="3">The Spirit and the bride, on one hand, desire that the Lord will come, and, on the other hand, yearn that the thirsty sinner also will come to take the water of life for his satisfaction. When we have a sincere desire for the Lord's coming, we also have an earnest concern for the sinner's salvation.</note>

Whether one will suffer the plagues or share in the blessing depends on how one deals with the prophecy of this book. We should not add to the prophecy, nor should we take away anything from it.

Only the grace of the Lord Jesus can enable us to live and walk according to these visions and prophecies.

        <note num="3">Some ancient authorities omit, the saints. Amen.[br][br]The New Jerusalem, the last major item revealed in this book, is not only the conclusion of the entire Bible but also the ultimate consummation of all the important items revealed in the Bible. The Triune God, the Triune God's economy, Christ's redemption, God's salvation, the believers, the church, and the kingdom are all consummated in the New Jerusalem as the consummating item. Thus, to say that the New Jerusalem is a physical city is not logical; it does not correspond with this book's principle of using signs for the revelation of the mysterious things. According to the entire revelation of the complete Bible, the New Jerusalem, the conclusion of the complete Bible, is a divine mingling of the processed Triune God with the redeemed and transformed tripartite man, a mingling of divinity with humanity, issuing in a universal, corporate, mysterious person. This person is:[br][br](1) The wife of the Lamb ([link]21:9[/link]);[br][br](2) The ultimate consummation of God's tabernacle and temple, as the eternal mutual habitation of both God and man ([link]21:3[/link], [link]22[/link]);[br][br](3) The ultimate consummation of God's work of the new creation in the old creation throughout the generations ([link]Acts 4:11[/link]; [link]John 2:19[/link]; [link]Matt. 16:18[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 3:9-12[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 2:4-5[/link]); and[br][br](4) The ultimate consummation of God's eternal economy and God's divine accomplishments.</note>
