        <text>[note]1[/note]In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim the king of Judah [xref]a[/xref]Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it.</text>
        <note num="1">The book of Daniel concerns the destiny of Israel apportioned out by God, the contents of the seventy weeks ([link]9:24-27[/link]). It also concerns human government from Nimrod to Antichrist. Because Israel and human government are for Christ, this book also reveals certain aspects of Christ, who is the center and the circumference, the centrality and the universality, of God's move. In particular, it reveals Christ's death ([link]9:25-26[/link]), His appearing in His second coming ([link]2:34-35[/link], [link]45[/link]), His receiving dominion and a kingdom ([link]7:13-14[/link]), His being the companion of the suffering witnesses of God ([link]3:23-25[/link]), and His excellency ([link]10:4-9[/link]).[br/][br/]The central thought of Daniel is that the ruling of the heavens ([link]4:26[/link]), i.e., of the God of the heavens ([link]2:37[/link], [link]44[/link]), over all human government on earth matches God's eternal economy so that Christ would terminate the old creation for the germination of the new creation and would smash and crush the aggregate of human government and establish the eternal kingdom of God.</note>

        <text>And the Lord gave Jehoiakim the king of Judah into his hand with some of the [xref]a[/xref]vessels of the house of God; and he brought them into the land of [note]1[/note][xref]b[/xref]Shinar to the house of his god, and he brought the [note]2[/note]vessels into the treasury of his god.</text>
        <note num="1">The origin of Babylon was Babel in the land of Shinar, which is Chaldea ([link]Gen. 11:2[/link], [link]9[/link], [link]28[/link]; [link]Dan. 1:1-2[/link], [link]4[/link]). For the children of Israel to be taken captive to Babylon means that they were captured back to the place of the worship of idols ([link]Jer. 50:1[/link], [link]38[/link]), i.e., back to Babel, to the original place where their forefather Abraham had worshipped idols ([link]Josh. 24:2-3[/link]). Abraham was called by God out of Chaldea to Canaan to worship God ([link]Acts 7:2-4[/link]). By this, the worship of the unique God, which had been lost through Adam's fall, was resumed ([link]Gen. 12:5-8[/link]). Eventually, because of their degradation God's people were taken back to the very place out of which Abraham had been called. See notes 1[sup]1[/sup], par. 1, and 15[sup]1[/sup] in [link]Jer. 50[/link].</note>
        <note num="2">In the deportation to Babylon the testimony of God's elect in the worship of the unique God, Jehovah, was utterly destroyed by the carrying of some of the vessels of the temple of God into the land of Shinar and the putting of these vessels into the temple of idols ([link]2 Chron. 36:6-7[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">Nebuchadnezzar's devilish temptation was first to seduce the four brilliant young descendants of God's defeated elect, Daniel and his three companions, to be defiled by partaking of his unclean food, food offered to idols. The king's choice provision was defiling, unclean, for it had been offered to Nebuchadnezzar's gods. For Daniel and his companions to eat that food would have been to take in the defilement, to take in the idols, and thus to become one with Satan (cf. [link]1 Cor. 10:19-21[/link]). In principle, this was a temptation to eat the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which joins man to Satan (cf. [link]Gen. 3:1-6[/link]). When Daniel and his companions refused to eat Nebuchadnezzar's unclean food and chose instead to eat vegetables ([link]vv. 8-16[/link]), in principle they rejected the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and took the tree of life, which caused them to be one with God (cf. [link]Gen. 2:9[/link], [link]16-17[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">In his devilish tempting of Daniel and his companions, Nebuchadnezzar also changed their names, which indicated that they belonged to God, to names that made them one with idols ([link]vv. 6-7[/link]). The name Daniel, meaning God is my Judge, was changed to Belteshazzar, meaning the prince of Bel, or the favorite of Bel ([link]Isa. 46:1[/link]); the name Hananiah, meaning Jah has graciously given, or favored of Jah, was changed to Shadrach, meaning enlightened by the sun god; the name Mishael, meaning Who is what God is? was changed to Meshach, meaning Who can be like the goddess Shach? and the name Azariah, meaning Jah has helped, was changed to Abed-nego, meaning the faithful servant of the fire god Nego.</note>

        <note num="1">Daniel fought the battle by countering the devil's temptation with bold rejection ([link]vv. 8-13[/link]). God honored Daniel's fighting ([link]vv. 14-20[/link]), and Daniel and his companions became the overcomers among the remnant of God's defeated elect. Because of the captivity of God's elect in Babylon, apparently God was defeated in His interests on earth. Actually, He preserved His worship and testimony through the young overcomers. The elect were defeated, but the young overcomers were victorious. Their victory was God's victory. Because of this victory God could boast to Satan that in the midst of Babylon, God still had some overcomers who were victorious over Satan's devices. Eventually, it was through the overcomers among God's captured elect, such as Daniel and his companions, that God was able to turn the age and bring a remnant of His captured people back to the land of Canaan (see note [link]18[sup]1[/sup] in 1 Kings 19[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">The contents of Nebuchadnezzar's dream were a great human image and its destiny. The vision of the great image in this chapter is the controlling vision in the book of Daniel. This great image signifies the aggregate of human government throughout human history, from the beginning of human government at Babel (Babylon) in the land of Shinar ([link]Gen. 10:8-10[/link]; [link]11:1-9[/link]), as signified by the head of the image, to the termination of human government in human history in the Roman Empire with the ten kings (see note [link]32[sup]1[/sup][/link], par. 2), as signified by the ten toes ([link]vv. 40-44a[/link]; [link]7:24[/link]; [link]Rev. 13:1[/link]; [link]17:12[/link]). From its beginning to its termination, human government has always done three things: rebel against God, exalt man, and worship idols ([link]Gen. 11:4[/link] and note 2).</note>

        <note num="1">The head of gold ([link]vv. 36-38[/link]), corresponding to the first beast in [link]7:3-4[/link], signifies Nebuchadnezzar, the founder and the king of Babylon. The breast and the arms of silver ([link]v. 39a[/link]), corresponding to the second beast in [link]7:5[/link], signify Medo-Persia, and the abdomen and thighs of bronze ([link]v. 39b[/link]), corresponding to the third beast in [link]7:6[/link], signify Greece, including Macedonia. The legs of iron and the feet partly of iron and partly of clay ([link]v. 33[/link]), corresponding to the fourth beast in [link]7:7-8[/link], signify the Roman Empire with its last ten kings ([link]vv. 40-44a[/link]; [link]7:7-11[/link], [link]19-26[/link]; [link]Rev. 17:7-13[/link]).[br/][br/]According to the human image in this chapter, in the sight of God all human government throughout history is composed of four empires: the Babylonian Empire, the Medo-Persian Empire, the Macedonian-Grecian Empire, and the Roman Empire. The beginning of human government was at Babel (Babylon), which was built by Nimrod ([link]Gen. 10:8-10[/link]), and the ending of human government will be the revived Roman Empire under Antichrist. Although the form and appearance of the Roman Empire have vanished, the culture, spirit, and essence of the Roman Empire continue to exist today (see note [link]12[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 7[/link]). At the beginning of the great tribulation ([link]Matt. 24:21[/link]) the form and appearance of the Roman Empire will be restored under Antichrist. According to the books of Daniel and Revelation, the last Caesar of the Roman Empire will be Antichrist, who will be supported by ten kings ([link]Rev. 17:10-12[/link] and notes). Thus, the aggregate of human empires that began with Nimrod at Babel will consummate with Antichrist and his ten kings.[br/][br/]If the head of the great human image is Babylon, the entire image must also be Babylon. In the eyes of God, the entire human government from Nimrod to Antichrist is Babylon. Under Antichrist, the last Caesar, the Roman Empire will be both political and religious Babylon ([link]Rev. 17-18[/link]). The empire of Antichrist will be the political and physical Babylon, i.e., "Babylon the Great" ([link]Rev. 18:2[/link]), whereas the Roman Catholic Church, called "MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT" ([link]Rev. 17:5[/link]), will be the religious Babylon.

These nations are partly autocratic and partly democratic.

The periods of history signified by the first three parts of the great human image and the two legs have been fulfilled, but the period signified by the ten toes has not yet been fulfilled.

        <note num="1">The destiny of the great human image is to be crushed by a stone cut out without hands ([link]vv. 34-35a[/link], [link]44b-45[/link]). This stone is Christ. Through His crucifixion Christ was cut by God by being put to death ([link]Zech. 3:9[/link]; [link]Acts 2:23[/link]), and in His resurrection ([link]Acts 2:24[/link]) He was cut out to be a stone in three aspects: the foundation stone and the cornerstone for the building up of the church ([link]Isa. 28:16[/link]; [link]Matt. 21:42[/link]), the stumbling stone to the unbelieving Jews ([link]Isa. 8:14[/link]; [link]Matt. 21:44a[/link]; [link]Rom. 9:33[/link]), and the crushing stone to destroy the totality of human government ([link]Matt. 21:44b[/link]).[br/][br/]When Christ comes as the crushing stone, He will not come alone; rather, He will come with His overcomers, His bride, His increase, as His army ([link]John 3:29-30[/link]; [link]Rev. 17:14[/link]; [link]19:7-8[/link], [link]11[/link], [link]14[/link]). During the church age, the age of mystery, Christ is building up the church to be His bride ([link]Eph. 5:25-29[/link]). Before He descends to earth, Christ will have a wedding, in which He will marry the overcomers ([link]Rev. 19:7-9[/link]), those who have been fighting the battle against God's enemy for years and who have already overcome the evil one (cf. [link]Rev. 12:11[/link]). After His wedding, He as the Husband will come with His newlywed bride to destroy Antichrist, who with his army will fight against God directly ([link]Rev. 17:14[/link]; [link]19:19[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">At His appearing as the God-cut stone, Christ with His overcomers &amp;#8212; the corporate Christ &amp;#8212; will strike the ten kings with Antichrist ([link]Rev. 19:11-21[/link]), thereby crushing the great image from the toes to the head ([link]v. 35[/link]). This will be Christ's universal judgment on the aggregate of human government from Antichrist back to Nimrod, thus ending the age of man's government on earth in the old creation and initiating the age of God's dominion over the entire earth in the millennium and in the new heaven and new earth for eternity.</note>

        <note num="3">The great mountain here signifies the eternal kingdom of God, which will fill the whole earth forever ([link]v. 44[/link]; [link]7:13-14[/link]). After coming to crush the aggregate of human government, the corporate Christ &amp;#8212; Christ with His overcoming bride &amp;#8212; will become a great mountain to fill the whole earth, making the whole earth God's kingdom. Thus the great human image will be replaced with the eternal kingdom of God on earth ([link]Rev. 11:15-17[/link]).[br/][br/]The increase of the stone into a great mountain signifies the increase of Christ (cf. [link]John 3:29-30[/link]). The church is Christ's increase in life, but the eternal kingdom of God is Christ's increase in administration ([link]Mark 4:26-29[/link]). Hence, Christ is not only the church but also the kingdom of God ([link]1 Cor. 12:12[/link]; [link]Luke 17:21[/link]). As the stone, Christ is the centrality of God's move, and as the mountain, He is the universality. Hence, He is the all-inclusive One, the One who fills all in all ([link]Eph. 1:23[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">The first beast corresponds to the head of gold of the great human image in [link]2:32a[/link], [link]36-38[/link], signifying Babylon with its king, Nebuchadnezzar. Its being like a lion, the king of the beasts, signifies that it was the most fierce and cruel, and its having the wings of an eagle, the king of the fowls, signifies that it was in the air, which belongs to Satan, the ruler of the air ([link]Eph. 2:2[/link]), and that its move was swift. The plucking of its wings signifies that its moving power was taken away and that it became like a beast in the field, as mentioned in [link]4:23-25a[/link], [link]33[/link].

        <note num="1">The second beast corresponds to the breast and arms of silver of the great human image in [link]2:32b[/link], [link]39a[/link], signifying Medo-Persia. Its resembling a bear signifies that it was not as strong and swift as the lion but that it was still fierce and cruel. Its being raised up on one side signifies that Media and Persia became one dominion. That three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth signifies that three kingdoms, Babylon, Asia Minor, and Egypt, were devoured by it. Its being commanded to arise and devour much flesh signifies that it would devour more nations.</note>

Its being like a leopard signifies that it was fierce, cruel, and swift ([link]Hab. 1:8a[/link]). That it had four wings of a bird on its back signifies that it was swift by means of its four generals. The beast had four heads, signifying that the four wings for swiftness became four heads, four generals who became the heads of four kingdoms. After the death of Alexander the Great, his four generals divided his empire into four kingdoms (see note [link]8[sup]2[/sup] in ch. 8[/link]).

After He receives the kingdom from God, He will come back to rule over the entire world ([link]Luke 19:12[/link], [link]15[/link]). Christ's coming will terminate the entire human government on earth from its end to its beginning, and it will bring in the eternal kingdom of God ([link]2:34-35[/link], [link]44[/link]).[br/][br/]As implied in Daniel's vision, Christ accomplished redemption and then immediately came to God in ascension to receive the kingdom (cf. [link]Rev. 5:6-7[/link]). This is according to God's view, in which there is no time element. Like Abraham, David, and the other prophets, Daniel did not see the mystery of the church, which was hidden from the ages and from the generations but was revealed to the New Testament apostles and prophets ([link]Eph. 3:3-11[/link]). He did not realize that between the first and second appearings of Christ there would be a period of time during which God would do a marvelous and mysterious work based on Christ's redemption. This work is to regenerate His redeemed people and then sanctify them, renew them, transform them, and conform them to the glorious image of Christ ([link]1 Pet. 1:3[/link]; [link]1 Thes. 5:23[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 4:16[/link]; [link]3:18[/link]; [link]Rom. 8:29[/link]).

        <note num="1">The contents of Daniel's vision are the seventy weeks, which are the destiny apportioned by God for His people and for His holy city. The purpose of the seventy weeks is to close the transgression, to make an end of sins, to make propitiation for iniquity, to bring in the righteousness of the ages, to seal up vision and prophet, and to anoint the Holy of Holies. In the old creation under human government, transgression, sins, and iniquity are prevailing. When Christ comes to crush human government ([link]2:34-35[/link]), at the time appointed, the transgression will be closed, sins will be ended, and iniquity will be propitiated. Then the righteousness of the ages will be brought in, the vision and prophet will be sealed, and the Holy of Holies will be anointed.</note>
        <note num="2">Or, seal up.</note>
        <note num="3">When Christ returns and the age is consummated, there will be no more unrighteousness on the earth.

At the end of the millennium the deceived nations (with Satan) will be removed in the last rebellion of mankind against God ([link]Rev. 20:7-10[/link]), and after the millennium the dead unbelievers and the demons will be cleared away through the judgment at the great white throne ([link]Rev. 20:11-15[/link]). Beginning with the millennium there will be the eternal kingdom of Christ with His righteousness, which is the righteousness of the ages, the eternal righteousness. In the millennium Christ will be the righteous One ([link]Jer. 23:5[/link]), and He will rule the thousand-year kingdom in righteousness ([link]Isa. 11:4-5[/link]). Ultimately, in the age of the ages, righteousness will dwell in the new heaven and new earth for eternity ([link]2 Pet. 3:13[/link] and note 3).</note>

        <note num="1">The seventy weeks are divided into three parts, each week being seven years in length (see "&#60;a href="chart-70weeks.html"&#62;The Chart of the Seventy Weeks and the Coming of Christ, with the Rapture of the Saints&#60;/a&#62;"). First, seven weeks (forty-nine years) were apportioned from the issuing of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem ([link]Neh. 2:1-8[/link]) to the completion of the rebuilding. Second, sixty-two weeks (434 years) were apportioned from the completion of the rebuilding of Jerusalem to the cutting off (crucifixion) of the Messiah ([link]v. 26[/link]). Third, the last week of seven years will be for Antichrist to make a firm covenant with the people of Israel ([link]v. 27[/link]).[br/][br/]There is a gap of unknown duration between the first sixty-nine weeks and the last week of the seventy weeks. This gap is the age of mystery, the age of grace, the age of the church ([link]Eph. 3:3-11[/link]; [link]5:32[/link]; [link]Col. 1:27[/link]). During this age Christ is secretly and mysteriously building up the church in the new creation to be His Body and His bride ([link]Eph. 5:25-32[/link]). When the new creation has become mature in life, it will be attached to Christ and become one with Him to be His counterpart ([link]Rev. 19:7-9[/link]). At the end of the last week of the seventy weeks, after Christ has married His bride, He with His bridal army will come as the stone cut out without hands and will crush the great human image from the toes to the head, destroying the human government that fights against God directly. Through this crushing the problem of human government in the old creation will be solved. Then Christ with His overcomers will increase to become a great mountain that fills the whole earth ([link]2:34-35[/link] and notes).</note>

        <note num="1">This refers to the crucifixion of Christ, which was the termination of the old creation, with the human government in the old creation, and the germination of God's new creation through the resurrection of Christ ([link]1 Pet. 1:3[/link]), with God's eternal kingdom as the divine administration in God's new creation. Thus, the cross of Christ is the centrality and universality of God's work.[br/][br/]The book of Daniel bears a particular characteristic: to draw the marking lines of the ages. First, the crucifixion of Christ in His first appearing is the landmark that terminated the age of the old creation for the germination of the age of the new creation in Christ's resurrection. In His crucifixion Christ, the last Adam, terminated the old creation ([link]2 Cor. 5:14[/link]), and in His resurrection He became the germinating Spirit, the life-giving Spirit ([link]1 Cor. 15:45[/link]), to germinate all God's chosen people in His resurrection ([link]John 12:24[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 1:3[/link]) to be God's new creation ([link]2 Cor. 5:17[/link]; [link]Gal. 6:15[/link]). This new creation begins with the believers in Christ as God's sons ([link]Gal. 3:26[/link]) and as Christ's members who constitute His Body ([link]1 Cor. 12:27[/link]). This Body will grow ([link]Eph. 4:13-16[/link]) and will eventually consummate in the New Jerusalem ([link]Rev. 21-22[/link]). Second, the upcoming appearing of Christ with His overcomers as His bride will be the landmark that will end the age of man's government on earth in the old creation and will initiate the age of God's dominion over the entire earth in the millennium and in the new heaven and new earth for eternity ([link]2:34-35[/link], [link]44[/link]; [link]7:13-14[/link]). Although in His first appearing Christ terminated the old creation spiritually through His death on the cross, the human government that began with Nimrod continues to exist. For this reason there is the need of Christ's second appearing, in which Christ will clear up the human government in the old creation physically and will usher in the universal and eternal kingdom of God. By Christ's appearing in these two aspects, and by the ruling of the heavens over all the environment on earth, Christ, who is the centrality and universality of God's economy and of God's move, will become the centrality and universality of God's elect, including Israel and the church.</note>

        <note num="1">Referring to Antichrist, typified here by Titus, the prince mentioned in [link]v. 26[/link]. At the beginning of the last week of the seventy weeks, the last seven years of the present age, Antichrist will make a firm covenant of peace with Israel. In the middle of that week he will break the covenant and will cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease ([link]12:11a[/link]). This will be the beginning of the great tribulation ([link]Matt. 24:21[/link]), which will last for three and a half years ([link]7:25[/link]; [link]12:7[/link]; [link]Rev. 11:2-3[/link]; [link]12:6[/link], [link]14[/link]; [link]13:5[/link]). During the great tribulation both the faithful Jews and the Christians still on earth will suffer Antichrist's persecution ([link]7:21[/link], [link]25[/link]; [link]Rev. 13:7[/link]). After he causes the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, Antichrist will replace them with the abominations of the desolator (the idols of Antichrist &amp;#8212; [link]12:11[/link]; [link]Matt. 24:15[/link]; [link]Rev. 13:14-15[/link]; [link]2 Thes. 2:4[/link]). These idols will remain in the temple for three and a half years, even until the complete destruction that has been determined is poured out upon the desolator, Antichrist ([link]2:34-35a[/link]; [link]2 Thes. 2:8[/link]; [link]Rev. 17:14[/link]; [link]19:20[/link]).[br/][br/]The fact that the temple will be devastated and contaminated by Antichrist strongly indicates that the temple, which has not been rebuilt since it was destroyed by Titus and the Roman army in A.D. 70, will be rebuilt by the Jews before the completion of the seventy weeks. This will be one of the final signs that will take place before Christ's return.</note>

The main subject of the vision in this chapter concerning the destiny of Israel is the great distress, which came upon Israel because of a war between the king of the south (Egypt) and the king of the north (Syria). The two kings waged war against each other on Israel's land, using it as a thoroughfare to invade each other ([link]11:2-35[/link]). These wars were a distress, a trial, to the children of Israel. This was especially true of the war that was waged by Antiochus Epiphanes, king of Syria, a descendant of one of the four successors of Alexander the Great and a full type of Antichrist. This was a severe trial sent by God to His chosen people because they had become corrupt after their return from captivity.</note>

        <note num="1">Before the vision concerning the destiny of Israel was unveiled to Daniel, he was given a vision of the spiritual scene that is behind the physical situation ([link]10:2-11:1[/link]). In this spiritual scene Christ is preeminent; hence, He is revealed first ([link]vv. 4-9[/link]). Here the excellent Christ appeared to Daniel as a man for his appreciation, consolation, encouragement, expectation, and stabilization (cf. notes [link]2[sup]1[/sup] in Gen. 18[/link] and [link]6[sup]1[/sup] in Judg. 13[/link]). He appeared to Daniel with many wonderful characteristics. First, He appeared as a Priest in His humanity, signified by the linen robe ([link]Exo. 28:31-35[/link]), to care for His chosen people in their captivity. Second, He appeared to Daniel in His kingship in His divinity, signified by the girdle of gold, for ruling over all the peoples. Furthermore, for His people's appreciation Christ appeared in His preciousness and dignity, as signified by His body being like beryl ([link]v. 6a[/link]). The Hebrew word for beryl could refer to a bluish-green or yellow precious stone, signifying that Christ in His embodiment is divine (yellow), full of life (green), and heavenly (blue). Christ also appeared in His brightness for shining over the people, as signified by His face being like the appearance of lightning ([link]v. 6b[/link]), and in His enlightening sight for searching and judging, as signified by His eyes being like torches of fire ([link]v. 6c[/link]). Moreover, Christ appeared in the gleam of His work and move, as signified by His arms and His feet being like the gleam of polished bronze ([link]v. 6d[/link]). Finally, Christ appeared to Daniel in His strong speaking for judging people, as signified by the sound of His words being like the sound of a multitude ([link]v. 6e[/link]). As a man, the very centrality and universality of God's move on earth for the carrying out of His economy, such a Christ is precious, valuable, complete, and perfect. Cf.

        <note num="1">After the vision of Christ, an angelic messenger (he might have been Gabriel &amp;#8212; [link]8:16[/link]; [link]9:21[/link]; cf. [link]Luke 1:19[/link], [link]26[/link]) came to Daniel in answer to his prayer ([link]v. 12[/link]). He told Daniel that for twenty-one days he himself had been fighting against the prince of the kingdom of Persia ([link]v. 13[/link], cf. [link]v. 20a[/link]), probably an evil spirit, a rebellious angel, who followed Satan in his rebellion against God ([link]Rev. 12:4a[/link], [link]9b[/link]) and who was commissioned by Satan to help Persia. Thus, while Daniel was praying during those days, a spiritual struggle was taking place in the air between two spirits, one belonging to Satan and the other belonging to God. Another evil spirit, the prince of Greece (Javan), was about to come ([link]v. 20b[/link]). Only the archangel Michael, a prince fighting for Israel, fought together with the angelic messenger against the evil spirits ([link]vv. 13[/link], [link]21[/link]; cf. [link]Jude 9[/link]). Moreover, the angelic messenger stood up to support and strengthen Darius the Mede in the first year of his reign in order that he might receive the kingdom ([link]11:1[/link]; [link]5:30-31[/link]).

        <note num="1">The armies of Antiochus Epiphanes profaned the sanctuary, removed the daily sacrifice, and set up the abomination that desolates. Sacrifices, circumcision, and keeping the Sabbath were absolutely forbidden. Antiochus Epiphanes even went so far as to erect an altar to Zeus on the altar of burnt offering in the temple. Moreover, he set up his own image in the temple, sacrificed a sow on the altar, and sprinkled its blood in the temple. He forced the holy people to worship the idol and eat pork, and he seduced young men to commit fornication in the temple. In all these evils Antiochus Epiphanes typifies Antichrist, who will appear in the last week of the seventy weeks ([link]9:27[/link]; [link]Rev. 13:1-7[/link]). See note [link]27[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 9[/link].[br/][br/]According to this book the great human image in [link]2:31-45[/link] destroys and desecrates the temple of God four times. The first time was by the head, Nebuchadnezzar ([link]1:1-2[/link]; [link]2 Chron. 36:18-19[/link]); the second time was by Antiochus Epiphanes, a descendant of one of the four generals of Alexander the Great's Grecian Empire ([link]8:9-14[/link]; [link]11:31-32[/link]); the third time was by Titus, a prince of the Roman Empire, in A.D. 70 ([link]9:26[/link]; [link]Matt. 24:2[/link]); and the fourth time will be by Antichrist, part of the ten toes of the restored Roman Empire, in the middle of the last seven years of this age ([link]9:27[/link]; [link]12:7[/link], [link]11[/link]). All these instances show that the center, the aim, and the goal of Satan's struggle against God is related to the temple, which typifies first Christ as God's embodiment ([link]John 2:19-21[/link]) and then the church, the Body of Christ, as the enlargement of Christ ([link]1 Cor. 3:16-17[/link]; [link]Eph. 2:20-22[/link]). God desires to have a place on earth where His people can worship Him, as a testimony that He still has an interest on this earth; but Satan is always struggling to destroy this place (cf. [link]Matt. 16:18[/link]; [link]John 2:19[/link]). Ultimately, as revealed in the New Testament, Satan will be fully destroyed ([link]Rev. 20:10[/link]), and the church as God's house ([link]1 Tim. 3:15[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 2:5[/link]), the mingling of God with His redeemed people, will be fully built up in Christ's resurrection and will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the center of the new heaven and the new earth for eternity ([link]Rev. 21-22[/link]).</note>

When Christ comes back to set up the kingdom, the small number of remaining Jews, the remnant of Israel ([link]Zech. 13:8-14:2[/link] and notes), will see Christ descending in the air and will repent, receive Him, and be saved and regenerated ([link]Zech. 12:10-14[/link]; [link]14:4-5[/link]; [link]Matt. 24:30[/link]; [link]Rom. 11:26-27[/link]; [link]Rev. 1:7[/link]). However, because they will be the later believers, they will not participate in the heavenly section of the kingdom as kings and priests, but rather will be kept on the earth to be the priests of God ([link]Isa. 2:2-3[/link]; [link]Zech. 8:20-23[/link]) in the earthly section of the thousand-year kingdom. See note [link]2[sup]2[/sup] in Matt. 3[/link].[br/][br/]In the millennial kingdom there will be three groups of people: (1) the overcoming believers in the heavenly section as kings and priests in the heavenlies (see note [link]6[sup]4[/sup] in Rev. 20[/link]); (2) the saved Jews who will be on the earth as the priests teaching the restored nations (see note [link]20[sup]1[/sup] in Zech. 8[/link]); and (3) the restored nations as the citizens under the ruling of the overcoming believers as the co-kings of Christ and also under the teaching and care of the saved Jews (see notes [link book="Matt." chapter="25"]32[sup]1[/sup][/link] and [link]34[sup]1[/sup] in Matt. 25[/link]). After the thousand years of the age of the kingdom, the old heaven and the old earth will be burned in order to be renewed ([link]2 Pet. 3:12-13[/link] and notes) and become a new heaven and new earth ([link]Rev. 21:1[/link]). At that time the Jews who are saved and regenerated by the Lord in His second coming will join all the believing saints of the Old Testament age and the New Testament age to be the New Jerusalem as God's dwelling place and expression for eternity ([link]Rev. 21:12[/link], [link]14[/link]). The nations who remain at the end of the millennium will be transferred to the land in the new earth to be the citizens forever ([link]Rev. 21:24-26[/link]; [link]22:2b[/link]). That will be the eternal kingdom of God, in which God's chosen, created, regenerated, sanctified, transformed, and glorified people, who are one with God for eternity, will rule over and teach the restored (but not regenerated) nations, who will be the citizens in the new heaven and the new earth. Eventually, in eternity in His eternal kingdom God will have His priests, His kings, and His people ([link]Rev. 22:3[/link], [link]5[/link]; [link]21:3[/link]) forever.</note>

After the millennium, the kingdom age, those who died as unbelievers will rise in the resurrection of judgment and will suffer eternal reproach and contempt in eternity forever and ever ([link]v. 2b[/link]; [link]John 5:29b[/link]; [link]Rev. 20:15[/link]).</note>
