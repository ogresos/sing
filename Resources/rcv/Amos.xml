        <note num="1">David is a type of Christ as the King. The tabernacle of David is the kingdom of David and the royal family of David. That kingdom, that royal family, fell when Nebuchadnezzar came to capture the nation of Israel, devastate the land, burn the city, destroy the temple, and carry off the king ([link]2 Kings 25:1-21[/link]). In Amos's prophecy God promised that in a certain day the kingdom of David and the family of David would be restored, and all the nations would be called by the name of Jehovah. This prophecy indicates that Christ will come back to be the real David ([link]Isa. 9:7[/link]; [link]16:5[/link]; [link]Jer. 30:9[/link]; [link]Ezek. 34:23-24[/link]; [link]37:24-25[/link]; [link]Hosea 3:5[/link]) and will rebuild, i.e., restore, the kingdom of His forefather David for the restoration of the entire universe. At that time the kingdom of David will become the kingdom of Christ and of God for eternity ([link]Rev. 11:15[/link]). In the restored kingdom all the nations will be called by the name of Jehovah; i.e., all the nations will belong to God. Amos's prophecy in [link]vv. 11-12[/link] was quoted by James in [link]Acts 15:16-18[/link] to confirm Peter's and Paul's going to the Gentiles, because in the restoration all the Gentiles will become God's people, just as the Jews are.</note>
