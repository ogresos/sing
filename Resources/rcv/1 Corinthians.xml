        <text>Paul, a [note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]called apostle of Christ Jesus through the [note]2[/note][xref]b[/xref]will of God, and [note]3[/note]Sosthenes the brother,</text>
        <note num="1">An apostle is a sent one. Paul was such a one, not self-appointed but called by the Lord. His apostleship was authentic ([link]9:1-5[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 12:11-12[/link]; cf. [link]2 Cor. 11:13[/link]; [link]Rev. 2:2[/link]), having the authority of God's New Testament administration ([link]2 Cor. 10:8[/link]; [link]13:10[/link]). Based on this position with this authority the apostle wrote this Epistle, not only to nourish and build up the saints in Corinth but also to regulate and adjust the church there.</note>
        <note num="2">The will of God is His determination for the carrying out of His purpose. Through this will Paul was called to be an apostle of Christ. Paul's assertion here strengthened his apostolic position and authority.</note>
        <note num="3">Sosthenes here was probably not the same Sosthenes as in [link]Acts 18:17[/link], because this Epistle was written in Ephesus ([link]16:8[/link]) not long after the apostle left Corinth, where the other Sosthenes was a ruler of the synagogue when Paul was persecuted there. This Sosthenes, as a brother in the Lord, must have gone out together with the apostle for the ministry. The mentioning of him here strengthened Paul's apostleship and points out the principle of the Body.</note>

        <text>To the [note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]church of God which is [note]2[/note]in [xref]b[/xref]Corinth, [note]3[/note]to those who have been [note]4[/note][xref]c[/xref]sanctified [note]5[/note]in Christ Jesus, the [note]6[/note][xref]d[/xref]called saints, [note]7[/note]with all those who [note]8[/note][xref]e[/xref]call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, [i]who is[/i] [note]9[/note][xref]f[/xref]theirs and ours:</text>
        <note num="1">The church of God! Not the church of Cephas, of Apollos, of Paul, or of any practice or doctrine, but of God. In spite of all the division, sin, confusion, abusing of gifts, and heretical teaching in the church in Corinth, the apostle still called it "the church of God" because the divine and spiritual essence which makes the assembled believers the church of God was actually there. Such a spiritual address by the apostle was based on his spiritual view in looking upon the church in Christ. Such a simple address alone should have eliminated all the division and confusion in both practice and doctrine.</note>
        <note num="2">The church is constituted of the universal God, but it exists on earth in many localities, one of which was Corinth. In nature the church is universal in God, but in practice the church is local in a definite place. Hence, the church has two aspects: the universal and the local. Without the universal aspect, the church is void of content; without the local aspect, it is impossible for the church to have any expression and practice. Hence, the New Testament stresses the local aspect of the church also ([link]Acts 8:1[/link]; [link]13:1[/link]; [link]Rev. 1:11[/link]; etc.).</note>
        <note num="3">[i]To the church of God[/i] equals [i]to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus.[/i] This strongly indicates that the church is a composition of the saints and that the saints are the constituents of the church. The two should not be considered separate entities. Individually, we are the saints; corporately, we are the church.</note>
        <note num="4">I.e., made holy, separated unto God for the fulfillment of His purpose. See note [link]2[sup]3[/sup] in Rom. 1[/link].</note>
        <note num="5">[i]In Christ[/i] means in the element and sphere of Christ. Christ is the element and sphere that separated us, made us holy, unto God when we believed into Him, that is, when we were brought into an organic union with Him through our faith in Him.</note>
        <note num="6">The believers in Christ are the called saints, not called [i]to be[/i] saints. This is a positional matter, a sanctification in position with a view to sanctification in disposition. See note [link]19[sup]2[/sup] in Rom. 6[/link].</note>
        <note num="7">Not [i]and[/i] but [i]with[/i] all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place. This indicates (1) that a local church, such as the church in Corinth, is composed only of those believers in that locality, not of all believers in every place, and (2) that this Epistle was intended not only for the believers in that one church in Corinth but for all believers in every place. This Epistle is for all believers of whatever place or time.</note>
        <note num="8">To call upon the name of the Lord implies to believe into Him ([link]Rom. 10:14[/link]). All believers in the Lord should be His callers ([link]Acts 9:14[/link], [link]21[/link]; [link]22:16[/link]). We have been called to call, called by God to call upon the name of the Lord Jesus.</note>
        <note num="9">Christ as the all-inclusive One belongs to all believers. He is our allotted portion given to us by God ([link]Col. 1:12[/link]). The apostle added this special phrase at the end of this verse to stress the crucial fact that Christ is the unique center of all believers in whatever place or situation. In this Epistle the apostle's intention was to solve the problems among the saints in Corinth. For all the problems, especially the matter of division, the only solution is the all-inclusive Christ. We have all been called into the fellowship of, the participation in, Him ([link]v. 9[/link]). All believers should be focused on Him, not being distracted by any gifted person, any overstressed doctrine, or any particular practice.</note>

        <note num="1">[i]Gift[/i] here refers to the inward gifts issuing from grace, such as the free gift of eternal life ([link]Rom. 6:23[/link]) and the gift of the Holy Spirit ([link]Acts 2:38[/link]) as the heavenly gift ([link]Heb. 6:4[/link]). It does not refer to the outward, miraculous gifts, such as healing, speaking in tongues, etc., mentioned in [link book="1 Cor."]chs. 12[/link] and [link book="1 Cor."]14[/link]. All the inward gifts are constituents of grace. They are the initial things of the divine life that are received of grace. All these need to grow ([link]3:6-7[/link]) to their full development and maturity. The Corinthian believers were not lacking in the initial gifts in life, but they were desperately short of the growth in life. Hence, however much they had been initially enriched in grace, they were still infants in Christ, soulish, fleshly, and even fleshy ([link]2:14[/link]; [link]3:1[/link], [link]3[/link]).</note>

        <note num="2">I.e., to partake of the fellowship of the union with God's Son, Jesus Christ, and of the participation in Him. God has called us into such a fellowship that we may enjoy Christ as our God-given portion. This word, like the word in [link]v. 2[/link] concerning Christ's being theirs and ours, stresses again the crucial fact that Christ is the unique center of the believers for the solving of the problems among them, especially the problem of division.[br][br]This book unveils to us that the very Christ, into whom we all have been called, is all-inclusive. He is the portion given to us by God ([link]v. 2[/link]). He is God's power and God's wisdom as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption to us ([link]vv. 24[/link], [link]30[/link]). He is the Lord of glory ([link]2:8[/link]) for our glorification ([link]2:7[/link]; [link]Rom. 8:30[/link]). He is the depths (deep things) of God ([link]2:10[/link]). He is the unique foundation of God's building ([link]3:11[/link]). He is our Passover ([link]5:7[/link]), the unleavened bread ([link]5:8[/link]), the spiritual food, the spiritual drink, and the spiritual rock ([link]10:3-4[/link]). He is the Head ([link]11:3[/link]) and the Body ([link]12:12[/link]). He is the firstfruits ([link]15:20[/link], [link]23[/link]), the second man ([link]15:47[/link]), and the last Adam ([link]15:45[/link]); and as such He became the life-giving Spirit ([link]15:45[/link]) that we may receive Him into us as our everything. This all-inclusive One, with the riches of at least twenty items, God has given to us as our portion for our enjoyment. We should concentrate on Him, not on any persons, things, or matters other than Him. We should focus on Him as our unique center appointed by God, that all the problems among the believers may be solved. It is into the fellowship of such a One that we have been called by God. This fellowship of God's Son became the fellowship that the apostles shared with the believers ([link]Acts 2:42[/link]; [link]1 John 1:3[/link]) in His Body, the church, and should be the fellowship that we enjoy in partaking of His blood and His body at His table ([link]10:16[/link], [link]21[/link]). Such a fellowship, which is carried out by the Spirit ([link]2 Cor. 13:14[/link]), must be unique because He is unique; it forbids any division among the members of His unique Body.</note>

        <note num="1">With this verse the apostle began to deal with the divisions among the Corinthians. First, he besought them through the name of our Lord, which is the name above all names ([link]Phil. 2:9[/link]) and should be the unique name among all His believers. However, the divisive Corinthians ranked the names of Paul, Apollos, and Cephas with the name of Christ, just as Peter on the mount of transfiguration ranked Moses and Elijah with Christ ([link]Matt. 17:1-8[/link]). To keep the oneness in the Lord and to avoid divisions, we need to uplift and exalt the unique name of our Lord by dropping all names other than this highest name.</note>

        <note num="3">In this Epistle the apostle dealt with eleven problems among the believers in Corinth. The first was the matter of division. Division is nearly always the leading problem, bringing in all other problems among believers. It may be considered the root of the problems among believers. Hence, in dealing with all the problems in the church at Corinth, the apostle's axe first touched the root, that is, the divisions among the believers there. The first virtue of the believers' walk that is worthy of God's calling is the keeping of the oneness of the Spirit in the Body of Christ ([link]Eph. 4:1-6[/link]).</note>

        <note num="3">The cross of Christ is the center in the accomplishment of God's New Testament economy, which is to have a church produced through the redemption of Christ. Paul preached Christ crucified ([link]v. 23[/link]; [link]2:2[/link]; [link]Gal. 3:1[/link]) and boasted in the cross of Christ ([link]Gal. 6:14[/link]). He did not preach the law with circumcision, which the Jews and some of the Jewish believers fought for ([link]Gal. 3:11[/link]; [link]5:11[/link]; [link]6:12-13[/link]), nor the philosophy that was promoted by the Greeks and some of the Gentile believers ([link]Col. 2:8[/link], [link]20[/link]). The cross of Christ abolished the ordinances of the law ([link]Eph. 2:15[/link]; [link]Col. 2:14[/link]), and we the believers have died to philosophy, an element of the world ([link]Col. 2:20[/link]). But Satan instigated the Judaizers and the Greek philosophers to preach their "isms" of worldly wisdom that the cross of Christ might be made void. The apostle Paul was alert in this matter. In dealing with the divisions among the Corinthian believers, which came mainly from the background of Jewish religion and Greek philosophy, the apostle stressed Christ and His cross. When Christ is taken to replace religious opinions and philosophical wisdom, and when His cross is working to deal with the flesh attached to any background, divisions will be terminated. The exaltation of natural preference and human wisdom cannot stand before Christ and His cross.</note>

The apostle was inwardly in fear of missing Christ in his ministry to the wisdom-seeking Greeks, and outwardly in trembling lest he be influenced by their prevailing aspiration for wisdom. By such fear and trembling he stood faithfully and steadfastly in his God-appointed ministry, according to the heavenly vision, avoiding any deviation. The religious Jews were proud of their traditional religion, and the philosophical Greeks were haughty in their worldly wisdom. In ministering Christ to both, the apostle was in fear and in much trembling. What a contrast between him and them!</note>

To love God means to set our entire being &amp;#8212; spirit, soul, and body, with the heart, soul, mind, and strength ([link]Mark 12:30[/link]) &amp;#8212; absolutely on Him, that is, to let our entire being be occupied by Him and lost in Him, so that He becomes everything to us and we are one with Him practically in our daily life. In this way we have the closest and most intimate fellowship with God, and we are able to enter into His heart and apprehend all its secrets ([link]Psa. 73:25[/link]; [link]25:14[/link]).

        <text>And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to [note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]spiritual men, but as to [note]2[/note][xref]b[/xref]fleshy, as to [note]3[/note][xref]c[/xref]infants in Christ.</text>
        <note num="1">A spiritual man is one who does not behave according to the flesh or act according to the soulish life but lives according to the spirit, that is, his spirit mingled with the Spirit of God. Such a man is dominated, governed, directed, moved, and led by such a mingled spirit.</note>
        <note num="2">This is a stronger and more gross expression than [i]fleshly[/i] in [link]v. 3[/link]. [i]Fleshy[/i] denotes being made of flesh; [i]fleshly[/i] denotes being influenced by the nature of the flesh and partaking of the character of the flesh. In this verse the apostle considered the Corinthian believers to be totally of the flesh, to be made of the flesh, and to be just the flesh. What a strong word! Then in [link]v. 3[/link] the apostle condemned their behaving in jealousy and strife as fleshly, as being under the influence of their fleshly nature and partaking of the character of the flesh.[br][br]This book reveals clearly that a believer may be one of three kinds of men: (1) a spiritual man, living in his spirit under the anointing of the Holy Spirit ([link]Rom. 8:4[/link]; [link]Gal. 5:25[/link]); (2) a soulish man, living in his soul under the direction of the soul, the natural life ([link]2:14[/link]); or (3) a fleshy and fleshly man, being of the flesh and living in the flesh under the influence of the nature of the flesh. The Lord desires that all His believers take His grace to be the first kind of man &amp;#8212; a spiritual man. This was the goal of this book: to motivate the Corinthian believers who were soulish, fleshy, and fleshly to aspire to the growth in life that they might become spiritual ([link]2:15[/link]; [link]3:1[/link]; [link]14:37[/link]). As we have been called by God into the fellowship of Christ ([link]1:9[/link]), who is now the life-giving Spirit ([link]15:45[/link]), and as we are one spirit with Him ([link]6:17[/link]), we can experience and enjoy Him only when we live in our spirit under the leading of the Holy Spirit. When we live in the soul or in the flesh, we cannot participate in Him or enjoy Him.</note>
        <note num="3">Although the Corinthian believers had received all the initial gifts in life and were lacking in none of them ([link]1:7[/link]), they did not grow in life after receiving them but remained infants in Christ, those who were not spiritual but fleshy. The apostle here pointed out their deficiency and their need, which was to grow in life to maturity, to be full-grown ([link]2:6[/link]; [link]Col. 1:28[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">To give milk to drink or food to eat is to feed others. Feeding is a matter of life; it differs from teaching, which is a matter of knowledge.

        <note num="1">To plant, to water, and to cause to grow are all related to the matter of life. This indicates that the believers are God's cultivated land ([link]v. 9[/link]) to grow Christ. The ministers of Christ can only plant and water. Only God can cause the growth. The Corinthian believers overesteemed the planter and the waterer and neglected the One who causes the growth. Hence, they did not grow in Christ as their life.[br][br]The Corinthian believers, under the prevailing influence of Greek philosophical wisdom, paid too much attention to knowledge, neglecting life. In this chapter Paul's intention was to turn their attention from knowledge to life, pointing out that to them he was a feeder and a planter; Apollos, a waterer; and God, the One who causes the growth. In [link]4:15[/link] he even told them that he was their spiritual father, who begot them in Christ through the gospel. From the view of life, the divine view, they were God's cultivated land to grow Christ. This was entirely a matter of life, a matter utterly missed by believers who are dominated by their soulish, natural life under the influence of their natural wisdom.</note>

The believers, who have been regenerated in Christ with God's life, are God's cultivated land, a farm in God's new creation to grow Christ that precious materials may be produced for God's building. Hence, we are not only God's cultivated land but also God's building. Corporately, we as the church of God have Christ planted in us. Christ must grow in us and, in the sense of this chapter, produce out of us not fruit but the precious materials of gold, silver, and precious stones for the building of God's habitation on earth. Thus, the building of God, the house of God, the church, is the increase of Christ, the enlargement of Christ in His unlimitedness.</note>

        <note num="1">The foundation is unique, but the building may differ because different builders may use different materials. All the Corinthian believers had accepted Christ as the foundation. However, some Jewish believers among them attempted to build the church with their Judaistic attainments, and some Greek believers attempted to use their philosophical wisdom. They were not like the apostles, who built with their excellent knowledge and rich experiences of Christ. The intention of the apostle in this Epistle was to warn the believers not to build the church with the things of their natural background. They must learn to build with Christ, both in objective knowledge and in subjective experience, as Paul did.</note>
        <note num="2">Gold, silver, and precious stones signify the various experiences of Christ in the virtues and attributes of the Triune God. It is with these that the apostles and all spiritual believers build the church on the unique foundation of Christ. Gold may signify the divine nature of the Father with all its attributes, silver may signify the redeeming Christ with all the virtues and attributes of His person and work, and precious stones may signify the transforming work of the Spirit with all its attributes. All these precious materials are the products of our participation in and enjoyment of Christ in our spirit through the Holy Spirit. Only these are good for God's building.[br][br]As God's cultivated land with planting, watering, and growing, the church should produce plants; but the proper materials for the building of the church are gold, silver, and precious stones, all of which are minerals. Hence, the thought of transformation is implied here. We need not only to grow in life but also to be transformed in life, as revealed in [link]2 Cor. 3:18[/link] and [link]Rom. 12:2[/link]. This corresponds with the thought in the Lord's parables in [link]Matt. 13[/link] concerning wheat, mustard seed, and meal (all of which are botanical) and the treasure hidden in the earth &amp;#8212; gold and precious stones (minerals). See notes [link book="Matt." chapter="13"]31[sup]1[/sup][/link], [link]33[sup]3[/sup][/link], and [link]44[sup]1[/sup] in Matt. 13[/link].</note>
        <note num="3">Wood, grass, and stubble signify the knowledge, realization, and attainments that come from the believers' natural background (such as Judaism or other religions, philosophy, or culture) and the natural way of living (which is mainly in the soul and is the natural life). Wood, in contrast to gold, signifies the nature of the natural man; grass, in contrast to silver, signifies the fallen man, the man of the flesh ([link]1 Pet. 1:24[/link]), who has not been redeemed or regenerated by Christ; and stubble, in contrast to precious stones, signifies the work and living that issue from an earthen source and have not been transformed by the Holy Spirit. All these worthless materials are the product of the believers' natural man together with what they have collected from their background. In God's economy these materials are fit only to be burned ([link]v. 13[/link]).</note>

God's salvation as a free gift to all believers is for eternity, whereas the Lord's reward to those (not all) believers whose Christian works are approved by Him is for the kingdom age.

But for their sake, that is, according to their condition and for their benefit, Paul transferred these things to himself and Apollos, using himself and Apollos as figures, as he had said in [link]3:5-8[/link]. By doing so, he expected the puffed up Corinthians to understand and apply to themselves the comparison that he made.</note>

They were not God, who causes the believers to grow. They should not be appraised beyond what they were. Otherwise, their appraisers, like the fleshly Corinthian believers, might be puffed up on behalf of one, against the other.</note>

Abusive eating, such as the eating of things sacrificed to idols, stumbles the weak brothers ([link]8:9-13[/link]; [link]10:28-30[/link], [link]32[/link]), and excessive eating damages our body. Both foods and our stomach will be done away with; God will bring both to nothing. The abuse of sex is fornication.

This is the realization of the Lord, who became the life-giving Spirit through resurrection ([link]15:45[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 3:17[/link]) and who is now with our spirit ([link]2 Tim. 4:22[/link]).

        <note num="1">To be sanctified is to be made holy, separated unto God for His purpose. As the believing wife is of the Lord and for the Lord, so her unbelieving husband is made holy, sanctified, separated unto God, because he is for his wife, who is of and for God. It is similar to the situation in which the temple and the altar make the common things holy when the latter are attached to them ([link]Matt. 23:17[/link], [link]19[/link]). The same principle applies to the unbelieving wife and the children. For the unbeliever to be sanctified in this way does not mean that he is saved, just as the sanctification of food through the saints' prayer has nothing to do with salvation ([link]1 Tim. 4:5[/link]). A saved person is a sanctified person, a saint. Anyone who is attached to him and is for him is made holy because of him.</note>

Even if he is able to become free, he should remain in his status as a slave. This corresponds with the basic concept of the apostle's instruction, as explicitly expressed in [link]vv. 20[/link] and [link]24[/link]. However, this part of the verse may be rendered as follows: "but, even if you are able to become free, take advantage of it rather." The apostle's point in this passage is that the believers should not be influenced by their outward status. Either to remain in slavery or to have freedom is all right, as long as it is with God.</note>

        <note num="2">In [link]v. 10[/link] the apostle said, "I charge, not I but the Lord." In [link]v. 12[/link] he said, "I say, I, not the Lord." In [link]v. 25[/link] he said, "I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give my opinion." Here he says, "according to my opinion; but I think that I also have the Spirit of God." All these words indicate the New Testament principle of incarnation (that is, that God and man, man and God, become one). This differs drastically from the principle of Old Testament prophecy (that is, that man speaks for God). In the Old Testament the word of Jehovah came upon a prophet ([link]Jer. 1:2[/link]; [link]Ezek. 1:3[/link]), the prophet being simply the mouthpiece of God. But in the New Testament the Lord becomes one with His apostles, and they become one with Him; thus, the two speak together. His word becomes their word, and whatever they utter is His word. Hence, the apostle's charge was the Lord's charge ([link]v. 10[/link]). What he said, though it was not spoken by the Lord, still became part of the divine revelation in the New Testament ([link]v. 12[/link]). He was one with the Lord to such a degree that even when he gave his own opinion, not the commandment of the Lord ([link]v. 25[/link]), he thought that he also had the Spirit of God. He did not claim definitely to have the Spirit of God, but he [i]thought[/i] that he [i]also[/i] had the Spirit of God. This is the highest spirituality; it is based on the principle of incarnation.</note>

        <note num="2">The apostle Paul was free from all men, being enslaved to no one ([link]v. 19[/link]). As all believers in Christ should be, he was free also from the bondage of any particular way of eating, although he practiced the principle of considerate love.</note>
        <note num="3">As he presented himself a pattern to the believers, the apostle came to the matter of his apostleship, which gave him authority to deal with all the problems covered in this book, serious problems concerning the church life and its fellowship. His handling of these problems was based not only on his teaching but also on the authority inherent in his apostleship. To deal with the situation, he had to take this standing and make this matter clear to the Corinthian believers. They had questioned his apostleship and were in a chaotic situation, mainly because of the foolishness of their worldly wisdom, self-confidence, and pride.[br][br]The Greek word for [i]apostle[/i] means [i]one who is sent.[/i] An apostle of the Lord is a believer who is sent out by Him with His authority to preach the gospel of God, to teach the divine truth, and to establish churches. In the first section of Acts, Peter and John were such apostles among the Jews, and in the second section of Acts, Paul and Barnabas were such apostles among the Gentiles. After them, others also became apostles, such as Silas (i.e., Silvanus) and Timothy ([link]1 Thes. 1:1[/link]; [link]2:6[/link]). As long as one has the power to preach the gospel, the gift to teach the divine truth, and the ability to establish churches, he is qualified and confirmed to be an apostle sent by the Lord with His commission and authority.</note>
        <note num="4">This refers to Paul's having seen the Lord in His glorious resurrected body ([link]15:5-8[/link]). This is a special privilege; it constitutes some dignity and glory to the seer, but it is not a requirement or qualification for being the Lord's apostle.

Yet the apostle called it a spiritual rock because it typified Christ, who was smitten and cleft by God to flow out the water of life ([link]John 19:34[/link]) to satisfy the thirst of His believers. Hence, the apostle said that the rock was Christ. Since it was a spiritual rock signifying Christ, it was able to follow the children of Israel. This indicates that Christ as the real rock is following His believers.</note>

        <note num="1">Lit., types (so also in [link]v. 11[/link]); i.e., figures of facts or of spiritual truths. This book takes the history of the children of Israel in the Old Testament as a type of the New Testament believers. In [link]5:7-8[/link] the believers experienced Christ as their Passover and began to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread. Here in this chapter they are baptized unto their Moses (Christ), passing through their Red Sea (the death of Christ). They are now eating the spiritual food and drinking the spiritual drink that they might take their journey (the Christian race) toward their good land (the all-inclusive Christ). Also, they are warned here ([link]v. 11[/link]) not to repeat the history of the children of Israel in doing evil against God, as illustrated in [link]vv. 6-11[/link].[br][br]The goal of God's calling of the children of Israel was that they would enter into the promised land to enjoy its riches so that they might establish God's kingdom and be God's expression on earth. However, although all Israel was redeemed through the passover, delivered out of the Egyptian tyranny, and brought to the mountain of God to receive the revelation of God's dwelling place, the tabernacle, nearly all fell and died in the wilderness, failing to reach this goal ([link]Heb. 3:7-19[/link]) because of their evildoings and unbelief. Only Caleb and Joshua reached the goal and entered into the good land ([link]Num. 14:27-30[/link]). This signifies that although we have been redeemed through Christ, delivered out of Satan's bondage, and brought into the revelation of God's economy, we may yet fail to reach the goal of God's calling, that is, to enter into the possession of our good land, Christ ([link]Phil. 3:12-14[/link]), and enjoy His riches for the kingdom of God that we may be His expression in the present age and participate in the fullest enjoyment of Christ in the kingdom age ([link]Matt. 25:21[/link], [link]23[/link]). This should be a solemn warning to all New Testament believers. It was especially applicable to the Corinthians, who were in danger of repeating the failure of the children of Israel in the wilderness.</note>

        <note num="1">[link]Verses 3-16[/link] deal with the seventh problem, the problem concerning head covering. The first six problems, dealt with in [link]chs. 1-10[/link], may be considered one group. They are concerned with matters in the realm of human life. The last five problems, dealt with in [link]chs. 11-16[/link], constitute another group. They are concerned with matters in the realm of God's administration. The first problem in this latter group concerns the headship of Christ and of God in the divine government. In [link]Eph. 1:22-23[/link] the headship of Christ over all things is to His Body, the church. Here the headship of Christ over every man is related to individuals. Christ is the Head of the Body, the church ([link]Eph. 5:23[/link]), corporately, and of the believers individually. He is the Head of every one of us directly. In the apostle's dealing with the Corinthians' problems related to God's administration, the headship of Christ and of God was his first concern.</note>
        <note num="2">In the divine governmental ordination, woman is under the headship of man. God created the female in this way ([link]Gen. 2:18-24[/link]; [link]1 Tim. 2:13[/link]). According to the nature ([link]v. 14[/link]) created by God, woman is subordinate to man.</note>
        <note num="3">Christ is God's anointed One, the One appointed by God. Hence, He is under God, and God as the Originator is His Head. This refers to the relationship between Christ and God in the divine government.[br][br]In dealing with the problem of head covering, the apostle took the headship of God, the headship of Christ, and the headship of man as strong ground for his instruction. His instruction concerning head covering was based not on any religious practice or human custom but on the headship in God's governmental administration. Such a strong base leaves no ground for argument over the matter of head covering.</note>

        <note num="1">This indicates that the head covering is a covering in addition to long hair.

        <note num="1">I.e., the head covering, which signifies man's headship over the woman.</note>
        <note num="2">This was further ground for the teaching concerning head covering. Head covering is closely related to God's headship, God's authority. The archangel with his subordinates rebelled against God's headship ([link]Ezek. 28:13-18[/link]; [link]Isa. 14:12-15[/link]; [link]Matt. 25:41[/link]), establishing his kingdom of darkness ([link]Matt. 12:26[/link]; [link]Col. 1:13[/link]), and became Satan, God's adversary. After God created man, Satan seduced man to follow him and rebel against God. Then God sent His Son to destroy Satan and rescue man out of his authority back to God's kingdom ([link]1 John 3:8[/link]; [link]Heb. 2:14[/link]; [link]Col. 1:13[/link]). Now, when the believers worship God in praying to Him or in speaking for Him, they should bear some signs that they are under God's headship, the divine authority, showing the observing angels (cf. [link]4:9[/link]), who are concerned with this matter, that they (the believers) are keeping God's ordained order in His administration. For this, the sisters should have a sign, a covering, on their head.</note>

This was called a love feast ([link]2 Pet. 2:13[/link]; [link]Jude 12[/link]), and it came from the background of the passover feast ([link]Luke 22:13-20[/link]). At the end of their love feast they ate the Lord's supper with the bread and the cup to remember the Lord ([link]vv. 23-25[/link]). The Corinthians did not do it properly. They did not wait for one another (cf. [link]v. 33[/link]). Each took his own supper first. The rich became drunken and the poor were hungry ([link]v. 21[/link]). This caused divisions and parties among them ([link]v. 18[/link]) and spoiled the Lord's supper. Thus, their eating was not the eating of the Lord's supper ([link]v. 20[/link]).</note>

        <note num="2">The real remembrance of the Lord is to eat the bread and drink the cup ([link]v. 26[/link]), that is, to participate in, to enjoy, the Lord, who has given Himself to us through His redeeming death.

        <note num="2">We should take the Lord's supper unto the remembrance of Him by declaring His redeeming death without ceasing until He comes back to set up God's kingdom ([link]Matt. 26:29[/link]). By His first coming the Lord accomplished His death to carry out an all-inclusive redemption for the producing of the church. After His death He went away to receive the kingdom, and He will come again with the kingdom ([link]Dan. 7:13-14[/link]; [link]Luke 19:12[/link]). The period between His first and second comings is the church age. The church thus bridges the gap between the Lord's first coming and His second coming and connects His death in the past with God's kingdom in the future. Hence, to declare the Lord's death until He comes may imply the declaring of the existence of the church for the bringing in of the kingdom. When we eat the Lord's supper in this way, with a view to a continual remembrance of Him in His first and second comings, that supper becomes a satisfaction to Him in relation to the kingdom, God's administration.</note>

        <note num="3">The apostle used the expression [i]the body[/i] instead of [i]the body of the Lord.[/i] This may imply the fact that, in addition to the physical body of the Lord ([link]v. 24[/link]), there is the mystical Body of Christ ([link]Eph. 4:4[/link]). Therefore, when we participate in the Lord's table, we must discern whether the bread on the table signifies the one Body of Christ or any division of man (any denomination). In discerning the Body of Christ, we should not partake of the bread in any division or with any divisive spirit. Our participation in the Lord's table must be the unique fellowship of His unique Body without any division in practice or in spirit.[br][br]The apostle's dealing with head covering concerns the Head ([link]v. 3[/link]); his dealing with the Lord's supper (the Lord's table) concerns the Body. Regarding the headship of Christ, which represents God and is represented by man, we must keep the divine governmental order ordained by God, without any disorder. Regarding the Body of Christ, we must be properly regulated by the apostle's instruction, without any confusion and division. The Head is Christ, and the Body is the church. Christ and the church &amp;#8212; these two &amp;#8212; are the controlling and directing factors of the apostle's dealings with the confused and disorderly church. In [link]chs. 1-10[/link] he dealt with the church's problems first by stressing Christ as God's center and our portion. After this, in [link]chs. 11-16[/link] he emphasized the church as God's goal and our concern. In [link]chs. 1-10[/link] he began with Christ as the antibiotic to heal the sick church's diseases. Then from [link]ch. 11[/link] he went on to the church and used the church, the Body, as the inoculation against the church's disorder. Both Christ and the church are crucial to the carrying out of God's administration in His New Testament economy.</note>

No one who speaks in the Spirit of God would say, "Jesus is accursed"; he would like to say, and he is able to say, "Jesus is Lord!" No worshippers of God should be silent; all should use their voices to speak forth "Jesus is Lord!" in the Spirit of God.

The genuine and proper speaking in tongues is one of the many gifts of the Spirit ([link]v. 4[/link]), one of the many aspects of the manifestation of the Spirit ([link]v. 7[/link]). Some say that speaking in tongues is the initial evidence of the baptism in the Spirit, and that later it becomes a gift of the Spirit. They say that every believer must speak in tongues as the initial evidence, but that not every believer needs to have the gift of speaking in tongues. This kind of teaching has no ground in the New Testament. The New Testament makes it abundantly clear that speaking in tongues is only one of the many gifts of the Spirit and that not all the believers have this gift.</note>
        <note num="5">To make the unknown tongues known, understandable ([link]14:13[/link]). This is the ninth item of the manifestation of the Spirit listed here. However, the manifestation of the Spirit by the believers consists of more than nine items. The apostleship, helps, and administrations by the Spirit listed in [link]v. 28[/link], the seeing of visions and the dreaming of dreams by the Spirit mentioned in [link]Acts 2:17[/link], the signs and wonders referred to in [link]Heb. 2:4[/link], and three of the five miraculous acts prophesied in [link]Mark 16:17-18[/link] are not listed here. The apostle listed here only nine items of the Spirit's manifestation as an illustration. Of these nine, speaking in tongues and interpretation of tongues are listed as the last two because they are not as profitable as the other items for the building up of the church ([link]14:2-6[/link], [link]18-19[/link]). Of these nine gifts and those listed in [link]vv. 28-30[/link], prophecy as prediction, faith, gifts of healing, works of power, speaking in tongues, and interpretation of tongues are miraculous. The rest &amp;#8212; a word of wisdom (such as the word of the apostles), a word of knowledge (such as the word of the teachers), and speaking for God and speaking forth God in prophecy by the prophets, discerning of spirits, helps, and administrations &amp;#8212; are gifts developed by the growth in life ([link]3:6-7[/link]), like those listed in [link]Rom. 12:6-8[/link], out of the inward, initial gifts mentioned in [link]1:7[/link] (see note 1 there). The miraculous gifts, especially speaking in tongues and interpretation of tongues, do not require any growth in life. The Corinthians did much speaking in tongues, yet they still remained infants in Christ ([link]3:1-3[/link]). However, the gifts developed in life require growth in life, even maturity, for the building up of the church. It was for this purpose that this Epistle was written to the Corinthians.</note>

        <note num="1">As the Spirit is the sphere and element of our spiritual baptism, and as in such a Spirit we were all baptized into one organic entity, the Body of Christ, so we should all, regardless of our race, nationality, and social rank, be this one Body. Christ is the life and constituent of this Body, and the Spirit is the reality of Christ. It is in this one Spirit that we were all baptized into this one living Body to express Christ.</note>
        <note num="2">The believers of Christ are baptized through water and in the Spirit into (1) Christ, (2) the death of Christ ([link]Rom. 6:3[/link]), (3) the name &amp;#8212; the person &amp;#8212; of the Triune God ([link]Matt. 28:19[/link]), and (4) the Body of Christ. Baptism ushers the believers into an organic union with Christ and the Triune God, making them living members of the Body of Christ. All the gifts, as the manifestation of the Spirit distributed to the individual believers by the Spirit, are for the profit, the building up, of this Body. The apostle was very conscious of this. He was Body-conscious, Body-centered, unlike the Corinthians and so many other believers through the centuries who are self-centered concerning spiritual gifts. Hence, after this verse he gave the Corinthians a long discourse concerning the Body. His intention was to rescue them from self-seeking back to a concern for the Body, that they might no longer be for their individual profit but for the building up of the Body.</note>

        <note num="5">To be baptized in the Spirit is to get into the Spirit and to be lost in Him; to drink the Spirit is to take the Spirit in and to have our being saturated with Him. By these two procedures we are mingled with the Spirit. To be baptized in the Spirit is the initiation of the mingling and is once for all. To drink the Spirit is the continuation and accomplishment of the mingling and is perpetual, forever. This requires us to call on the Lord continually and draw water with joy from Him as the fountain of living water ([link]Isa. 12:3-4[/link]; [link]John 4:10[/link], [link]14[/link]).</note>

        <text>Now there abide [note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]faith, [xref]b[/xref]hope, [xref]c[/xref]love, these three; and the greatest of these is [xref]d[/xref]love.</text>
        <note num="1">Faith receives the divine things ([link]John 1:12[/link]) and substantiates the spiritual and unseen things ([link]Heb. 11:1[/link]). Hope reaps and partakes of the things substantiated by faith ([link]Rom. 8:24-25[/link]). Love enjoys the things received and substantiated by faith and partaken of by hope, for nourishing ourselves, building up others ([link]8:1[/link]), and expressing God, thus fulfilling the entire law ([link]Rom. 13:8-10[/link]). Such love causes us to grow in life for the development and use of the spiritual gifts, and it is the most excellent way to have the greater gifts. Hence, it is the greatest of the three abiding virtues. So we must pursue it ([link]14:1[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">The apostle's word in [link]vv. 2-6[/link] gives a clear and definite view that speaking in tongues is much less important than prophesying. The apostle strongly belittled the gift of tongues and exalted the gift of prophecy because his main concern was the church, not the individual believers. Speaking in tongues, even if it is genuine and proper, edifies only the speaker himself, but prophesying builds up the church. To prophesy in revelation or to teach in knowledge with clear, understandable words is more profitable to the church than to speak in tongues with unknown words ([link]v. 19[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">Here the apostle said, "So also you, since you are zealous of spirits." This shows that in their spiritual pursuings in those days, because of their background the Corinthian believers, who were Gentiles by birth, confused the unique Holy Spirit with the various evil spirits; they were not clear about nor did they adequately hold the uniqueness of the Holy Spirit. This is proved by the words [i]but the same Spirit[/i] in [link]12:4[/link]. The apostle's word here did not sanction their confused pursuings; rather, based on the fact of their confusion, he exhorted them to seek to transcend and thereby to excel in the midst of their confusion.</note>
        <note num="2">The Greek word denotes [i]to become full, to abound, to overflow;[/i] it also denotes [i]to excel.[/i] See note [link]8[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 8[/link]. According to the context of this verse, the word here does not denote [i]to abound, to increase,[/i] but [i]to excel and be extraordinary.[/i] The words [i]since you are zealous of spirits[/i] in the first part of this verse indicate already that in their pursuing of spiritual gifts, the Corinthian believers were confusing the Holy Spirit with the evil spirits. The apostle considered that kind of confused pursuing very demeaning, to the extent that the Corinthian believers might even have been considered barbarians. Therefore, the apostle exhorted them not to pursue some indiscernible, intermixed spiritual things for their own enjoyment and display, but to pursue so as to excel, that is, go beyond the low pursuing, for the building up of the church.</note>
        <note num="3">The apostle was fully occupied with the consideration of building up the church. He was fully church-conscious and church-centered, altogether different from the self-centered Corinthians. Their problem with spiritual gifts was due to their self-seeking, their not caring for the building up of the church. In dealing with the first six problems, which were in the realm of human life, the apostle stressed Christ as God's unique portion to us; in dealing with the last five problems, which were in the realm of the divine administration, he emphasized the church as God's unique goal for us. The Corinthians were not only void of Christ but also ignorant of the church. The apostle's completing ministry ([link]Col. 1:25[/link]) is composed of Christ as the mystery of God ([link]Col. 2:2[/link]) and the church as the mystery of Christ ([link]Eph. 3:4[/link]). However, the Corinthians missed both, even though they were under the apostle's ministry. They were pitifully in themselves, blind and ignorant.</note>

In praying to the Lord, we must exercise our regenerated spirit and our renewed mind.

Our prayer must be from our God-contacted and God-contacting spirit and through our sober and understanding mind, with clear and understandable words, that our prayer may touch God, nourish and strengthen ourselves, and build up others.</note>

Prayer is worship, which should be in spirit ([link]John 4:24[/link]). When we pray with the spirit, not in an unknown tongue but in understandable words, our mind is automatically used to interpret and express the thought of the spirit. What the apostle meant here is that in the church meeting, for the profit of all the attendants, we should pray with our mind in intelligible words ([link]v. 19[/link]) to express the burden in our spirit. In a church meeting our prayer not only should be heard by the Lord for His answer but also should be intelligible to all the attendants for their profit. For this purpose we should learn to use our mind in public prayer just as we use our spirit, training our mind to cooperate with our spirit, even to be one with our spirit, that the spirit may become the spirit of our mind ([link]Eph. 4:23[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">[i]Has,[/i] occurring five times in this verse, is a widely used Greek word, a word with many meanings, of which the following three are the main ones: (1) [i]to hold, to possess, to keep (a certain thing);[/i] (2) [i]to have (a certain thing) for enjoyment;[/i] (3) [i]to have the means or power to do a certain thing.[/i] The first two meanings should be applied to the first three of the five items listed in this verse, and the third to the last two &amp;#8212; a tongue and an interpretation of a tongue. This indicates that when we come to the church meeting, we should have something of the Lord to share with others, whether a psalm to praise the Lord, a teaching (of the teacher) to minister the riches of Christ to edify and nourish others, a revelation (of the prophet, [link]v. 30[/link]) to give visions of God's eternal purpose concerning Christ as God's mystery and the church as Christ's mystery, a tongue for a sign to the unbelievers ([link]v. 22[/link]) that they may know and accept Christ, or an interpretation to make a tongue concerning Christ and His Body understandable. Before coming to the meeting, we should prepare ourselves for the meeting with such things from the Lord and of the Lord, either through our experience of Him or through our enjoyment of His word and fellowship with Him in prayer. After coming into the meeting, we need not wait, and should not wait, for inspiration; we should exercise our spirit and use our trained mind to function in presenting what we have prepared to the Lord for His glory and satisfaction and to the attendants for their benefit &amp;#8212; their enlightenment, nourishment, and building up.[br][br]This is like the Feast of Tabernacles in ancient times. The children of Israel brought the produce of the good land, which they had reaped from their labor on the land, to the feast and offered it to the Lord for His enjoyment and for their mutual participation in fellowship with the Lord and with one another. We must labor on Christ, our good land, that we may reap some produce of His riches to bring to the church meeting and offer. Thus the meeting will be an exhibition of Christ in His riches and will be a mutual enjoyment of Christ shared by all the attendants before God and with God for the building up of the saints and the church.[br][br]According to the stress and emphasis of this Epistle, all five items listed in this verse should focus on Christ as God's center for our portion and the church as God's goal for our aim. The psalm should be the praise to God for giving Christ as wisdom and power to us for our daily life and church life. The teaching from a teacher and the revelation from a prophet should teach and minister Christ and the church, which is the Body of Christ, to people. A tongue and its interpretation also should have Christ and the church as their center and content. Any stress on things other than Christ and the church will bring confusion to the church and distract it from the central lane of God's New Testament economy, making it like the church in Corinth.</note>
        <note num="2">Or, edification. Whatever we do in the church meeting must be for the building up of the saints and the church. To exhibit Christ and enjoy Him in the meetings for the building up of His Body must be our unique purpose and goal.</note>

But [link]1 Tim. 2:12[/link] says that women are not permitted to teach, that is, teach as authorities (there, teaching is related to the exercising of authority), so as to define doctrine. Hence, according to the New Testament principle, for women not to be permitted to speak in the church meetings means that women are not permitted to teach with authority in relation to the defining of doctrine. In this sense they should be silent in the church meetings. They are not permitted to speak, because they should be subject to men. This is related to the matter of authority ordained by God in His government. In God's governmental ordination, women are not permitted to speak with authority over men. They may pray and prophesy, that is, (mainly) speak for the Lord and speak forth the Lord. However, they must do this under the covering of the brothers, because they are charged here to be subject.</note>

        <note num="1">This too indicates that to be a prophet or to be a spiritual person is highly esteemed in the church for the carrying out of God's New Testament economy. A prophet is second to an apostle in God's administration in the church ([link]12:28[/link]). He is one who speaks for God and speaks forth God, and who has received revelation of the mysteries concerning Christ and the church ([link]Eph. 3:5[/link]), which revelation is the foundation for the building of the church ([link]Eph. 2:20[/link]). A spiritual person is one who lives according to his spirit, which is mingled with God's Spirit, and who is able to discern all the spiritual things ([link]3:1[/link] and notes; [link]2:15[/link] and note). Such spiritually knowledgeable persons should fully know that the apostle Paul's teachings are the commandment of the Lord, and their speaking should correspond with his teachings. Paul's spirit was strong and his word was frank in dealing with the disorderly Corinthians. He charged them to know definitely that his teachings were a commandment of the Lord, having the authentic authority of the Lord.</note>

        <note num="1">Actually, this entire chapter deals with prophesying and speaking in tongues. Since prophesying is the most profitable gift for building up both the saints and the church with the rich ministry of Christ, it was highly esteemed and promoted by the apostle. Since speaking in tongues affords no profit for building up, the apostle was faithful to expose its lesser value. Both the apostle's esteeming and his exposing were according to his concern for the fulfilling of God's purpose in building up the church with the riches of Christ. At the conclusion of this chapter he still charged us to desire earnestly to prophesy for God's building. However, in order to keep the all-inclusiveness and oneness of the church, he also charged us not to forbid speaking in tongues.</note>

Thus, grace is the Triune God becoming life and everything to us. (See notes [link]17[sup]1[/sup] in John 1[/link] and [link]21[sup]1[/sup] in Gal. 2[/link].) It is by this grace that Saul of Tarsus, the foremost of sinners ([link]1 Tim. 1:15-16[/link]), became the foremost apostle, laboring more abundantly than all the apostles. His ministry and living by this grace are an undeniable testimony to Christ's resurrection.</note>
        <note num="2">[i]Not I but the grace of God[/i] equals [i]no longer I[/i]...but...Christ in [link]Gal. 2:20[/link]. The grace that motivated the apostle and operated in him was not some matter or some thing but a living person, the resurrected Christ, the embodiment of God the Father who became the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, who dwelt in the apostle as his everything.</note>

        <text>But if Christ is proclaimed that He has been [xref]a[/xref]raised from the dead, how [i]is it that[/i] some among you say that there is [note]1[/note]no resurrection of the dead?</text>
        <note num="1">In this chapter the apostle dealt with the Corinthians' heretical saying that there is no resurrection of the dead. The Corinthians were like the Sadducees ([link]Matt. 22:23[/link]; [link]Acts 23:8[/link]). This was the tenth problem among them. It is the most damaging and destructive to God's New Testament economy, worse than the heresy of Hymenaeus and Philetus concerning resurrection ([link]2 Tim. 2:17-18[/link]). Resurrection is the life pulse and lifeline of the divine economy. If there were no resurrection, God would be the God of the dead, not of the living ([link]Matt. 22:32[/link]). If there were no resurrection, Christ would not have been raised from the dead. He would be a dead Savior, not a living One who lives forever ([link]Rev. 1:18[/link]) and is able to save to the uttermost ([link]Heb. 7:25[/link]). If there were no resurrection, there would be no living proof of our being justified by His death ([link]Rom. 4:25[/link] and note), no imparting of life ([link]John 12:24[/link]), no regeneration ([link]John 3:5[/link]), no renewing ([link]Titus 3:5[/link]), no transformation ([link]Rom. 12:2[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 3:18[/link]), and no conformity to the image of Christ ([link]Rom. 8:29[/link]). If there were no resurrection, there would be no members of Christ ([link]Rom. 12:5[/link]), no Body of Christ as His fullness ([link]Eph. 1:20-23[/link]), and no church as Christ's bride ([link]John 3:29[/link]), and therefore no new man ([link]Eph. 2:15[/link]; [link]4:24[/link]; [link]Col. 3:10-11[/link]). If there were no resurrection, God's New Testament economy would altogether collapse and God's eternal purpose would be nullified.</note>

        <note num="1">In the preceding verse the order of resurrection is mentioned: the first, Christ; then those who are Christ's. Accordingly, in this verse, after [i]then,[/i] one would expect a group of people to be named. However, here it does not tell us who, but it says "the end," because those who will be resurrected at the end in their own order are not in Christ.[br][br]The end here is the end of all the ages and dispensations of the old creation. It is also the end of the millennium before the new heaven and new earth ([link]Rev. 21:1[/link]). In all the ages and dispensations God, on one hand, has been dealing with His enemy Satan and all the negative things in the universe; on the other hand, He has been accomplishing all things for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose. The last of the ages and dispensations will be the millennium, the kingdom age, after which all God's dealings and accomplishments will be fully completed. That completion will be the end, the conclusion, of all God's work. At this end all the dead unbelievers, the unrighteous, will be resurrected unto judgment for eternal perdition ([link]John 5:29[/link]; [link]Rev. 20:5[/link], [link]11-15[/link]). They will be third in order in the resurrection.</note>

        <note num="3">After accomplishing redemption, Christ went to receive the kingdom from the Father ([link]Luke 19:12[/link], [link]15[/link]).

At the end of the millennium, after He has defeated Satan, the devil, and his evil angels (as all rule, authority, and power), and even death and Hades, putting all His enemies under His feet ([link]vv. 25-26[/link]) and casting all of them, including death and Hades, into the lake of fire ([link]Rev. 20:7-10[/link], [link]14[/link]), He will deliver the kingdom back to God the Father.</note>

        <note num="3">This chapter is on resurrection. Christ's resurrection was His victory over Satan, God's enemy, over the world, over sin, and over death. After His triumphal ascension to the height ([link]Eph. 4:8[/link]) in His resurrection, God subdued all the enemies for Him ([link]v. 25[/link]). Then, as One who is in resurrection, He will come to the earth with the kingdom of God ([link]Dan. 7:13-14[/link]) to exercise God's power and subdue everything on earth. This will continue for a thousand years ([link]Rev. 20:4[/link], [link]6[/link]). The last enemy to be abolished is death. The swallowing up of death will result in the ultimate victory of the Lord's resurrection, that is, in the ultimate and complete victory that He has accomplished in resurrection for us who believe in Him and participate in His resurrection. This is the ultimate issue of His resurrection for His and God's eternal kingdom and for the eternal enjoyment of His resurrection life in eternity by those who believe in Him.</note>

        <text>Now concerning the [note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]collection for the saints, [note]2[/note]just as I [xref]b[/xref]directed the [xref]c[/xref]churches of Galatia, so you also do.</text>
        <note num="1">This is the eleventh matter dealt with by the apostle in this Epistle, a matter concerned with money, mammon, and material possessions. All of fallen mankind is under the domination of mammon and material possessions ([link]Matt. 6:19-21[/link], [link]24-25[/link], [link]30[/link]; [link]19:21-22[/link]; [link]Luke 12:13-19[/link]). On the day of Pentecost, under the power of the Holy Spirit, all the believers overthrew this domination and had all their possessions in common for distribution to the needy ones ([link]Acts 2:44-45[/link]; [link]4:32[/link], [link]34-37[/link]). Because of the weakness of the believers' fallen nature (cf. [link]Acts 5:1-11[/link]; [link]6:1[/link]), that practice did not last long. It had already ended by the apostle Paul's time. Hence, the believers needed grace to overcome the power of mammon and material things and to release these things from Satan's domination that they might be offered to the Lord for the fulfillment of His purpose. Resurrection life is the supply for the believers to live such a life, a life trusting in God, not in material possessions, a life not for today but for the future, not for this age but for the coming age ([link]Luke 12:16-21[/link]; [link]1 Tim. 6:17-19[/link]), a life that overthrows the usurpation of temporal and uncertain riches. This may be the reason that the dealing with this matter comes after the dealing concerning the reality of resurrection life. In any case, this dealing is related to God's administration among the churches.</note>
        <note num="2">Again, this strongly indicates that all the local churches should be the same in their practice ([link]7:17[/link]; [link]11:16[/link]; [link]14:33[/link]).</note>

        <text>On the [note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]first day of the week each one of you should lay aside in store to himself whatever he may have been prospered, that no collections be made when I come.</text>
        <note num="1">The seventh day of the week, the Sabbath, was a memorial of God's creation ([link]Gen. 2:1-3[/link]; [link]Exo. 20:8[/link], [link]11[/link]). The first day of the week is a symbol of the Lord's resurrection; it is the day on which the Lord resurrected from the dead ([link]John 20:1[/link] and note 1) and is called "the Lord's Day" ([link]Rev. 1:10[/link]). The New Testament saints meet and offer their possessions on this day ([link]Acts 20:7[/link]), the day of the Lord's resurrection, signifying that they have been resurrected with the Lord ([link]Eph. 2:6[/link]) through His resurrection ([link]1 Pet. 1:3[/link]) and that they meet in resurrection by the resurrection life, not by their natural life, to remember the Lord and worship God with their offerings.</note>

        <note num="1">By this the Corinthians should have realized that Paul's attitude toward Apollos and his relationship with him were in sharp contrast to their preferences ([link]1:11-12[/link]). His attitude and relationship kept the oneness; their preferences caused division.</note>
        <note num="2">Both Paul and Apollos were persons living in the Spirit. Yet, one urged the other to visit the church, but the other did not have the desire to do so. This shows that both had freedom in the Spirit and that the Spirit had freedom in them. This shows also that no one exercised any control over the work of the Lord.</note>

Of Paul's fourteen Epistles, only this one ends with such a word of the assurance of love. This is because the apostle had been dealing with them with strong rebukes ([link]1:13[/link]; [link]3:3[/link]; [link]4:7-8[/link]; [link]5:2[/link], [link]5[/link]; [link]6:5-8[/link]; [link]11:17[/link]). He was faithful, honest, and frank toward them in the love of God in Christ ([link]2 Cor. 2:4[/link]), without being political. Hence, the Lord honored his dealings, and the Corinthians accepted his rebukes and repented, resulting in their being benefited ([link]2 Cor. 7:8-13[/link]).</note>
