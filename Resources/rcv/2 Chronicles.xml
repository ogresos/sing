        <text>And in the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa became [note]1[/note]diseased in his feet; his disease was very severe, yet even in his disease he pursued not Jehovah but the physicians.</text>
        <note num="1">Although Asa was a good king and did many good things, he offended God by forming an alliance with Ben-hadad king of Syria ([link]vv. 1-6[/link]). Furthermore, he became angry with the seer who rebuked him for trusting in the king of Syria instead of trusting in Jehovah ([link]v. 10[/link]). It might have been because of this offense that Asa became severely diseased in his feet. This disease caused his death ([link]v. 13[/link]).[br][br]God's dealing with the kings of Judah in the details of their living shows that it is not adequate for us who love God and seek Christ only to stand on the proper ground of the oneness of the church and to keep the fundamental truth. We also need to take care of who we are, how we behave, and how we conduct ourselves, including our interests, our intention, our purpose, our goal, our attitude, and our way of speaking. God dealt with all the good kings of Judah according to the law of Moses in detail. Anyone who was wrong with the law even a little would lose a great part of the enjoyment of the good land. In the Old Testament time, God's people were required to behave themselves according to the law. Today we are required by the New Testament to conduct ourselves according to the spiritual law, which is the compound, life-giving, all-inclusive, consummated Spirit, who dwells in our spirit ([link]Rom. 8:4[/link], [link]16[/link]; [link]Gal. 5:16[/link], [link]25[/link]). We need to learn from the example of the kings of Judah to have a God-man living in all the details of our daily life, a living in which we are crucified in our natural life to live by the divine life within us ([link]Gal. 2:20[/link]). We need to be warned and be on the alert that whatever we say, whatever we do, whatever we express, our attitude, our spirit, and our intention must be purified by the life-giving, compound, all-inclusive Spirit. Otherwise, we will lose much in the enjoyment of Christ, today's good land (see note [link]7[sup]1[/sup] in Deut. 8[/link]). See note [link]1[sup]1[/sup], par. 2, in 1 Kings 1[/link].</note>

        <note num="1">See note [link]11[sup]1[/sup] in 2 Kings 21[/link]. Although the kings of Judah stood on the ground of unity chosen by God and kept their belief in the Word of God, their condition did not match their standing. Most of them, like the kings of the kingdom of Israel, forsook God as the fountain of living waters and followed the idols, hewing out for themselves broken cisterns that hold no water ([link]Jer. 2:13[/link]). The kings of Judah repeatedly broke the law of God, which was given to them through Moses to govern them and keep them in the enjoyment of the God-promised good land. Eventually, God came in to take them away from the good land ([link]36:11-20[/link]). He would not allow them to enjoy the good land that He had given them because they did not keep His law to express Him but instead expressed His enemy, the devil.[br][br]In the eternal economy of God, the Father has allotted the Son, the all-inclusive Christ typified by the good land, to us as our eternal portion and has transferred us into Him that we may partake of Him ([link]Col. 1:12-13[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 1:30[/link], [link]9[/link]). We need to stand on the proper ground of the oneness of the Body of Christ ([link]Eph. 4:3-6[/link]) and keep the proper faith as Paul did ([link]2 Tim. 4:7[/link]). We also need to live and walk in Christ ([link]Col. 2:6[/link]), conducting ourselves according to God to be His expression (see note [link]12[sup]1[/sup], par. 2, in ch. 16[/link]). Then we will enjoy Christ, and the border of our enjoyment of Christ as the good land will be enlarged ([link]1 Chron. 4:10[/link]). If we do not conduct ourselves as God's expression, we will lose the enjoyment of Christ and will be carried away from Him by the enemy into "captivity," as the children of Israel were ([link]36:6[/link], [link]20[/link]; cf. [link]Gal. 5:1-4[/link]; [link]Col. 2:8[/link]). </note>
