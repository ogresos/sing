        <text>The [note]1[/note]beginning of the [note]2[/note]gospel of [note]3[/note]Jesus Christ, [note]4[/note]the [xref]a[/xref]Son of God,</text>
        <note num="1">The writer of this Gospel was Mark, also called John ([link]Acts 12:25[/link]), the son of one of the Marys (who was close to the apostle Peter in the church at Jerusalem &amp;#8212; [link]Acts 12:12[/link]) and the cousin of Barnabas ([link]Col. 4:10[/link]). He accompanied Barnabas and Saul in their ministry ([link]Acts 12:25[/link]) and joined Paul in the first journey of his ministry to the Gentiles; but he left Paul and turned back at Perga ([link]Acts 13:13[/link]). Because of his turning back, Paul refused to take him on his second journey. At that time Barnabas separated himself from Paul, and Mark then joined Barnabas in his work ([link]Acts 15:36-40[/link]). However, Mark was close to Paul in Paul's later years ([link]Col. 4:10[/link]; [link]Philem. 24[/link]) and was useful to him for his ministry until Paul's martyrdom ([link]2 Tim. 4:11[/link]). He was close to Peter and was probably with him continually, as seen in the fact that Peter considered him his son ([link]1 Pet. 5:13[/link]). From the early days of the church his Gospel has been considered a written account of the oral presentation of Peter, who accompanied the Savior in His gospel service from its beginning ([link]vv. 16-18[/link]) to its end ([link]14:54[/link], [link]66-72[/link]). Mark's record is according to historical sequence and gives more details concerning the historical facts than the other Gospels. The entire Gospel is summarized in Peter's word in [link]Acts 10:36-42[/link].[br][br]John presents the God-Savior, emphasizing the Savior's deity in His humanity. Matthew presents the King-Savior; Mark, the Slave-Savior; and Luke, the Man-Savior. Matthew, Mark, and Luke are synoptic in portraying the Savior's humanity in different aspects, with His deity. Since Mark presents the Savior as a slave, he does not tell His genealogy and status, because the ancestry of a slave is not worthy of note. Furthermore, in contrast to Matthew, who presents to us the Savior's marvelous teachings and parables concerning the heavenly kingdom, and John, who presents His profound revelations of divine truths, Mark's intention is not to impress us with the Slave's wonderful words but with His excellent deeds in His gospel service. Mark's Gospel provides more detail than the other Gospels in order to portray the Slave-Savior's diligence, faithfulness, and other virtues in the saving service He rendered to sinners for God. In Mark's Gospel are the fulfillment of the prophecies in [link]Isa. 42:1-4[/link], [link]6-7[/link]; [link]49:5-7[/link]; [link]50:4-7[/link]; [link]52:13-53:12[/link] concerning Christ as the Slave of Jehovah, and the details of the teaching in [link]Phil. 2:5-11[/link] regarding Christ as the Slave of God. His diligence in labor, His need of food and rest ([link]3:20-21[/link]; [link]6:31[/link]), His anger ([link]3:5[/link]), His groaning ([link]7:34[/link]), and His affection ([link]10:21[/link]) display beautifully His humanity in its virtue and perfection, while His lordship ([link]2:28[/link]), His omniscience ([link]2:8[/link]), His miraculous power, and His authority to cast out demons ([link]v. 27[/link]; [link]3:15[/link]), to forgive sins ([link]2:7[/link], [link]10[/link]), and to silence the wind and the sea ([link]4:39[/link]) manifest in full His deity in its glory and honor. What a Slave of God! How lovely and admirable! Such a Slave served sinners as their Slave-Savior, with His life as their ransom ([link]10:45[/link]), for the fulfillment of the eternal purpose of God, whose Slave He was.</note>
        <note num="2">I.e., glad tidings, good news ([link]Rom. 10:15[/link]). The gospel is the service (ministry) of the Slave-Savior as a Slave of God serving His people. Matthew begins with the kingly generations of Christ the King ([link]Matt. 1:1-17[/link]); Luke, with a human genealogy of Jesus the man ([link]Luke 3:23-38[/link]); and John, with the eternal origin of the Son of God ([link]John 1:1-2[/link]); whereas Mark begins not with the origin of His person but with the beginning of the gospel, the service of Jesus as a lowly Slave of God ([link]Phil. 2:7[/link]; [link]Matt. 20:27-28[/link]). As a rule, the service, not the person, of a slave is notable. See note [link]1[sup]1[/sup] in Matt. 1[/link].</note>
        <note num="3">This Gospel is a biography of the Slave-Savior, who was God incarnated as a Slave to save sinners. In this compound title, [i]Jesus Christ[/i] denotes His humanity and [i]the Son of God,[/i] His deity, both of which were adequately expressed by His human virtues and divine attributes in His ministry and move for His gospel service, as recorded in this Gospel.</note>

        <note num="1">The beginning of the gospel of the Slave-Savior was even as it is written in Isaiah concerning the ministry of John the Baptist. This indicates that John's preaching of the baptism of repentance was also a part of the gospel of Jesus Christ. It terminated the dispensation of law and replaced it with the dispensation of grace. Hence, the dispensation of grace began with the ministry of John, before the ministry of the Slave-Savior.</note>

        <note num="1">The ministry of the gospel of the Slave-Savior began with only a voice, not with a great movement.</note>
        <note num="2">The preaching of the gospel of the Slave-Savior began not in any center of civilization but in the wilderness, beyond the influence of human culture. See notes [link book="Matt." chapter="3"]3[sup]1[/sup][/link] and [link]1[sup]2[/sup] in Matt. 3[/link].</note>
        <note num="3">Lit., make ready. To prepare the way of the Lord is to change people's mind, turning their mind toward the Slave-Savior, and to make their heart right, straightening every part of their heart through repentance, that the Slave-Savior may enter into them to be their life and take possession of them ([link]Luke 1:17[/link]).</note>

        <note num="2">John was born a priest ([link]Luke 1:8-13[/link], [link]57-63[/link]); hence, he should have lived a priestly life in the temple, doing the priestly service. But he came to the wilderness and preached the gospel. This indicates that the age of the priesthood, in which sacrifices were offered to God, had been replaced by the age of the gospel, in which sinners are brought to God that God may gain sinners and that sinners may gain God.</note>
        <note num="3">Repentance is to change one's mind, turning it to the Slave-Savior, and baptism is to bury the repenting people, terminating them that the Slave-Savior may germinate them by regeneration ([link]John 3:3[/link], [link]5-6[/link]).</note>
        <note num="4">Or, unto. Repentance with baptism is for, and results in, forgiveness of sins, that the obstacle of man's fall may be removed and man may be reconciled to God.</note>

        <note num="1">Water signifies death and burial for the termination of the repenting people; the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of life and resurrection for the germination of the terminated people. The former was a sign of John's ministry of repentance; the latter, a sign of the Slave-Savior's ministry of life. John buried the repenting people in the death water; the Slave-Savior raised them up that they might be regenerated in the Spirit of His resurrection life. The death water, pointing to and signifying the all-inclusive death of Christ, into which His believers are baptized ([link]Rom. 6:3[/link]), buried not only the baptized people but also their sins, the world, and their past life and history (just as the Red Sea buried Pharaoh and the Egyptian army for the children of Israel &amp;#8212; [link]Exo. 14:26-28[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 10:2[/link]) and separated them from the God-forsaking world and its corruption (just as the flood did for Noah and his family &amp;#8212; [link]1 Pet. 3:20-21[/link]). The Holy Spirit, into whom the Slave-Savior baptized those who believed in Him, is the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of God ([link]Rom. 8:9[/link]). Hence, to be baptized in the Holy Spirit is to be baptized into Christ ([link]Gal. 3:27[/link]; [link]Rom. 6:3[/link]), into the Triune God ([link]Matt. 28:19[/link]), and even into the Body of Christ ([link]1 Cor. 12:13[/link]), which is joined to Christ in the one Spirit ([link]1 Cor. 6:17[/link]). It is through baptism in such a water and in such a Spirit that the believers in Christ are regenerated into the kingdom of God ([link]John 3:3[/link], [link]5[/link], and note [link]5[sup]2[/sup][/link]), into the realm of the divine life and the divine rule, that they may live by the eternal life of God in His eternal kingdom.</note>

In contrast to John's record in his Gospel ([link]John 1:29-42[/link]; [link]2:13-3:36[/link]; [link]5:1-47[/link]; [link]7:10-11:57[/link]), Mark recorded nothing of the Slave-Savior's ministry in Jerusalem and Judea during that period of time. Mark recorded only the Lord's leaving of Galilee to go to Jerusalem for the last time ([link]10:1[/link]) to accomplish His redemptive work. Then the gospel service was continued by His ministry on the way to Jerusalem and in Jerusalem and its vicinity ([link]10:1-14:42[/link]). It was concluded with His redeeming death, His life-imparting resurrection, His ascension for exaltation, and the continuation of His gospel service, carried out by His disciples' preaching to all the creation ([link]14:43-16:20[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">The Slave-Savior's proclaiming was to announce God's glad tidings to the miserable people in bondage; His teaching ([link]vv. 21-22[/link]) was to enlighten the ignorant ones in darkness with the divine light of the truth.

        <note num="1">The kingdom of God is the ruling, the reigning, of God with all its blessing and enjoyment. It is the goal of the gospel of God and of Jesus Christ (see notes [link chapter="4"]3[sup]2[/sup][/link] and [link]26[sup]3[/sup] in ch. 4[/link]). To enter into this kingdom, people need to repent of their sins and believe in the gospel that their sins may be forgiven and that they may be regenerated by God to have the divine life, which matches the divine nature of this kingdom ([link]John 3:3[/link], [link]5[/link]). All the believers in Christ can share the kingdom in the church age for their enjoyment of God in His righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit ([link]Rom. 14:17[/link]). This kingdom will become the kingdom of Christ and of God for the overcoming believers to inherit and enjoy in the coming kingdom age ([link]1 Cor. 6:9-10[/link]; [link]Gal. 5:21[/link]; [link]Eph. 5:5[/link]) that they may reign with Christ a thousand years ([link]Rev. 20:4[/link], [link]6[/link]). Then, as the eternal kingdom it will be an eternal blessing of God's eternal life for all God's redeemed to enjoy in the new heaven and new earth for eternity ([link]Rev. 21:1-4[/link]; [link]22:1-5[/link], [link]14[/link], [link]17[/link]). It was such a kingdom of God that had drawn near and into which the gospel of the Slave-Savior would bring His believers. For this kingdom the Slave-Savior told people to repent and believe in the gospel. See notes [link]3[sup]3[/sup] in John 3[/link], [link]28[sup]1[/sup] in Heb. 12[/link], and [link]3[sup]4[/sup] in Matt. 5[/link].</note>
        <note num="2">The Greek word means [i]have a change of mind.[/i] To repent is to have a change of mind with regret for the past and a turn for the future. On the negative side, to repent before God is not only to repent of sins and wrongdoings but also to repent of the world and its corruption, which usurp and corrupt people whom God created for Himself, and to repent of our God-forsaking life in the past. On the positive side, it is to turn to God in every way and in everything for the fulfillment of His purpose in creating man. It is a "repentance unto God," and is to "repent and turn to God" ([link]Acts 20:21[/link]; [link]26:20[/link]). See notes [link book="Matt." chapter="3"]2[sup]1[/sup][/link] and [link]2[sup]2[/sup] in Matt. 3[/link].</note>
        <note num="3">Repentance is mainly in the mind; believing is mainly in the heart ([link]Rom. 10:9[/link]). To believe in is to believe into the things in which we believe and to receive into us the things in which we believe. To believe in the gospel is mainly to believe in the Slave-Savior ([link]Acts 16:31[/link]), and to believe in Him is to believe into Him ([link]John 3:15-16[/link]) and to receive Him into us ([link]John 1:12[/link]) that we may be organically united with Him. Such a faith in Christ ([link]Gal. 3:22[/link]) is given to us by God through our hearing of the word of the truth of the gospel ([link]Rom. 10:17[/link]; [link]Eph. 1:13[/link]). This faith brings us into all the blessings of the gospel ([link]Gal. 3:14[/link]). Hence, it is precious to us ([link]2 Pet. 1:1[/link]). Such a precious faith must be preceded by repentance. See note [link]16[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 16[/link].</note>
        <note num="4">This is the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God ([link]v. 1[/link]), the gospel of God, and the gospel of the kingdom of God. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, with all the processes He passed through (such as incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension) and all the redemptive work He accomplished, is the content of the gospel ([link]Rom. 1:2-4[/link]; [link]Luke 2:10-11[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 15:1-4[/link]; [link]2 Tim. 2:8[/link]). Hence, the gospel is of Him. The gospel was planned, promised, and accomplished by God ([link]Eph. 1:8-9[/link]; [link]Acts 2:23[/link]; [link]Rom. 1:2[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 5:21[/link]; [link]Acts 3:15[/link]), and it is the power of God unto salvation to all the believers ([link]Rom. 1:16[/link]) that they may be reconciled to God ([link]2 Cor. 5:19[/link]) and regenerated by Him ([link]1 Pet. 1:3[/link]) to be His children ([link]John 1:12-13[/link]; [link]Rom. 8:16[/link]) and to enjoy all His riches and blessings as their inheritance ([link]Eph. 1:14[/link]). Hence, it is the gospel of God. It brings the believers into the realm of the divine ruling that they may participate in the blessings of the divine life in the divine kingdom ([link]1 Thes. 2:12[/link]). Hence, it is also the gospel of the kingdom of God. Thus, its full contents are the same as those of the New Testament with all its bequests. When we believe in this gospel, we inherit the Triune God with His redemption, His salvation, and His divine life with its riches as our eternal portion.</note>

The fallen angels work with Satan in the air ([link]Eph. 2:2[/link]; [link]6:11-12[/link]), and these unclean spirits, the demons, move with him on the earth. Both act evilly upon man for the kingdom of Satan. The demons' possession of people signifies Satan's usurpation of man, whom God created for His purpose. The third thing the Slave-Savior, who came to destroy the works of Satan ([link]1 John 3:8[/link]), did as a part of His service to God was to cast out these demons from the possessed people ([link]vv. 34[/link], [link]39[/link]; [link]3:15[/link]; [link]6:7[/link], [link]13[/link]; [link]16:17[/link]) that they might be delivered from Satan's bondage ([link]Luke 13:16[/link]), out of Satan's authority of darkness ([link]Acts 26:18[/link]; [link]Col. 1:13[/link]), into God's kingdom ([link]v. 15[/link]).

        <note num="1">The five incidents vividly recorded in [link]2:1-3:6[/link] form one particular group, showing how the Slave-Savior as the Slave of God carried out His gospel service to care for the needs of fallen people, who had been captured by Satan and carried away from God and the enjoyment of God, that they might be rescued from their captivity and might be brought back to God as their enjoyment.[br][br](1) As God with divine authority, He forgave the sins of the victim of sickness that He might release him from Satan's oppression ([link]Acts 10:38[/link]) and restore him to God. The scribes considered this to be against the theology of their religion ([link]vv. 1-12[/link]).[br][br](2) As a Physician to the sick and miserable people, He feasted with the tax collectors, who were disloyal and unfaithful to their race, and with sinners, who were despised and isolated from society, that they might taste the mercy of God and be recovered to the enjoyment of God. This was condemned by the self-righteous yet merciless scribes of the Pharisees ([link]vv. 13-17[/link]).[br][br](3) As a Bridegroom with the sons of the bridechamber, He caused His followers to be merry and happy without fasting. Thus He annulled the practice of the disciples of John (the new religionists) and the Pharisees (the old religionists) so that His followers could be delivered from the practices of their religion into the enjoyment of God's Christ as their Bridegroom, with His righteousness as their outer clothing and His life as their inner wine in God's New Testament economy ([link]vv. 18-22[/link]).[br][br](4) He allowed His followers to pick the ears of grain in the grainfields on the Sabbath so that they could satisfy their hunger. Thus, apparently they broke God's commandment concerning the Sabbath, but actually they pleased God because the hunger of Christ's followers was satisfied through Him, as the hunger of David and his followers had been satisfied with the bread of the Presence in the house of God. This indicates that in God's New Testament economy, it is a matter not of keeping the regulation of religion but of enjoying satisfaction in and through Christ as the real Sabbath rest ([link]vv. 23-28[/link]).[br][br](5) On the Sabbath He healed a man who had a withered hand, caring not for the keeping of the Sabbath but for the health of His sheep. Thus He indicated that in God's New Testament economy it is a matter not of keeping regulations but of imparting life. For this He was hated by the Pharisees, the religionists ([link]3:1-6[/link]).[br][br]All five merciful and living ways taken by the Slave-Savior to carry out His gospel service contradicted the formal and traditional religion and were therefore abhorred by the fleshly, stubborn, and lifeless religious leaders.</note>

Hence, He had not only the ability to save sinners but also the authority to forgive their sins. In this incident, although He as God forgave people's sins, He asserted that He was the Son of Man.

        <note num="3">Blindness is related to darkness ([link]Acts 26:18[/link]). To see, there is the need of light. The Slave-Savior's spittle may signify the word that proceeds out of His mouth (see note [link]6[sup]1[/sup] in John 9[/link]), a word that conveys the divine light of life to the receiver for the recovery of his sight.

        <note num="1">This displayed the Slave-Savior's tolerance, in the practice of the gospel service, toward those believers who were different from the ones closer to Him. In this respect the attitude of the apostle Paul in [link]Phil. 1:16-18[/link] and that of Moses in [link]Num. 11:26-29[/link], but not that of the impetuous John, are like His. It is very meaningful that this section, [link book="Mark" chapter="9"]vv. 38-50[/link], continues the previous section, [link]vv. 33-37[/link], in which the Slave-Savior taught His followers humility because they had argued with one another concerning who was greater. In that argument the two sons of thunder, James and John, probably played the leading roles (cf. [link]10:35-45[/link]). Here the same John would not tolerate a differing believer. His impetuous action was probably related to his ambition to be great. It might have been this ambition that caused his intolerance toward the different practice of other believers. This is a basic divisive factor among Christians. The Slave-Savior surely would not go along with John in this matter.</note>

The maxim here speaks of outward conformity in practice and is in regard to people who are not against Him ([link]Mark 9:39[/link]); that in Matthew speaks of the inward unity of purpose and is in regard to people who are against Him ([link]Matt. 12:24[/link]).

        <note num="1">John behaved as one who acted upon others. The Slave-Savior's wise word here turned him and the other disciples, making them those acted upon by others. This implied that all &amp;#8212; whether the disciples or other believers &amp;#8212; were under the Lord's care because all were His. Whether it was their treatment of other believers or other believers' treatment of them, anything done in the Lord's name, even the giving of a cup of water, would be rewarded by Him.</note>

        <text>[note]1[/note]Salt is good, but if the salt becomes [note]2[/note]unsalty, with what will you restore its saltiness? Have salt in yourselves and be at [xref]a[/xref]peace with one another.</text>
        <note num="1">See note [link]13[sup]2[/sup] in Matt. 5[/link]. The application of the word here differs from that in [link]Matt. 5:13[/link] and [link]Luke 14:34[/link]. In Matthew and Luke, salt, portraying the believers' influence on the world, is for the salting of the corrupted world; salt here, in apposition to the purging fire, is for the salting of sinning believers, even as God's chastisements are for the sinning believers in this age. Hence, the believers should have salt in themselves that they may be purified not only from sins but also from any divisive element (such as was displayed by the impetuous John in forbidding a differing brother and in arguing for greatness) and may thus be at peace with one another. Such purging salt purges the believers' speech that they may keep peace with one another ([link]Col. 4:6[/link]). The Lord's word here indicates that John's speech to the brother who differed from him had not been purged. Thus, the entire section, [link]vv. 38-50[/link], presents the Slave-Savior's teaching concerning the believers' being tolerant for the sake of unity.</note>

        <text>And He rose up [xref]a[/xref]from there and came into the [note]1[/note]borders of Judea and [xref]b[/xref]beyond the Jordan; and again crowds came together to Him, and as He was accustomed, again He [note]2[/note]taught them.</text>
        <note num="1">The Slave-Savior ministered in His gospel service for over three years in the despised region of Galilee (see note [link]14[sup]1[/sup], par. 2, in ch. 1[/link]), far from the holy temple and the holy city, the place where He had to die for the accomplishing of God's eternal plan. As the Lamb of God ([link]John 1:29[/link]), He had to be offered to God at Mount Moriah, where Abraham offered Isaac and enjoyed God's provision of a ram as a substitute for his son ([link]Gen. 22:2[/link], [link]9-14[/link]) and where the temple was built in Jerusalem ([link]2 Chron. 3:1[/link]). It had to be there that He would be delivered, according to the counsel determined by the Trinity of the Godhead ([link]Acts 2:23[/link]), to the Jewish leaders ([link]9:31[/link]; [link]10:33[/link]) and be rejected by them as the builders of God's building ([link]8:31[/link]; [link]Acts 4:11[/link]). It had to be there that He would be crucified according to the Roman form of capital punishment ([link]John 18:31-32[/link] and note; [link]19:6[/link], [link]14-15[/link]) to fulfill the type concerning the kind of death He would die ([link]Num. 21:8-9[/link]; [link]John 3:14[/link]). Moreover, according to Daniel's prophecy ([link]Dan. 9:24-26[/link]), that very year was the year that Messiah (Christ) was to be cut off (killed). Furthermore, as the Passover lamb ([link]1 Cor. 5:7[/link]), He had to be killed in the month of the Passover ([link]Exo. 12:1-11[/link]). Hence, He had to go to Jerusalem ([link]v. 33[/link]; [link]11:1[/link], [link]11[/link], [link]15[/link], [link]27[/link]; [link]John 12:12[/link]) before the Passover ([link]John 12:1[/link]; [link]Mark 14:1[/link]) that He might die there on the day of the Passover ([link]14:12-17[/link]; [link]John 18:28[/link]) at the place and the time foreordained by God.</note>

This was His obedience to God unto death ([link]Phil. 2:8[/link]), according to the counsel of God ([link]Acts 2:23[/link]), for the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan ([link]Isa. 53:10[/link]). The Slave-Savior knew that through His death He would be glorified in resurrection ([link]Luke 24:25-26[/link]) and that His divine life would be released to produce many brothers for His expression ([link]John 12:23-24[/link]; [link]Rom. 8:29[/link]). For the joy set before Him, He despised the shame ([link]Heb. 12:2[/link]) and volunteered to be delivered to the Satan-usurped leaders of the Jews and to be condemned by them to death. For this, God exalted Him to the heavens, seated Him at His right hand ([link]16:19[/link]; [link]Acts 2:33-35[/link]), bestowed on Him the name which is above every name ([link]Phil. 2:9-10[/link]), made Him both Lord and Christ ([link]Acts 2:36[/link]), and crowned Him with glory and honor ([link]Heb. 2:9[/link]).</note>

The fig tree was the symbol of the nation of Israel ([link]Jer. 24:2[/link], [link]5[/link], [link]8[/link]), and the temple was the center of Israel's relationship with God. As a fig tree planted by God, the nation of Israel did not bear fruit for Him, and as the center of Israel's relationship with God, the temple was filled with corruption. Hence, the Slave-Savior cursed the fruitless fig tree and cleansed the contaminated temple.

        <note num="1">In His ministry for the spreading of the gospel in Galilee in [link]1:14-10:52[/link], the Slave-Savior's work was to proclaim the gospel, teach the truth, cast out demons, and heal the sick. In that work His human virtues with His divine attributes were expressed as His qualification for and beauty in His divine service rendered to sinners for God. In His preparation in Jerusalem for His redemptive work ([link]11:15-14:42[/link]), His major work was to confront the opposing Jewish leaders, who should have been the builders of God's building ([link]12:9-10[/link]) but had actually been usurped by God's enemy, Satan, and instigated by him to plot to kill Him. In this confrontation, under their subtle and evil questioning, testing, and examining, His human dignity was expressed in His human genuineness ([link]vv. 15-18[/link]), and His divine wisdom and authority were expressed in His human conduct and perfection ([link]11:27-12:37[/link]), so that eventually His faultfinders became His quality-provers. This paved the way for Him to point out to these blind opposers that He, the Christ, the Son of David, was the Lord of David, that is, the very God ([link]12:35-37[/link]), that they might know His deity in His humanity, that is, that He was God living in man.</note>

The Slave-Savior also, as the real Passover lamb ([link]1 Cor. 5:7[/link]), was examined for four days before He was killed. He came to Bethany six days before the Passover ([link]John 12:1[/link]; [link]Mark 11:1[/link]). On the next day He came into Jerusalem and went back to Bethany ([link]John 12:12[/link]; [link]Mark 11:11[/link]). On the third day He came to Jerusalem again ([link]11:12-15[/link]) and began to be examined according to the Jewish law by the leaders of the Jews ([link]11:27-12:37[/link]; [link]14:53-65[/link]; [link]John 18:13[/link], [link]19-24[/link]) and according to the Roman law by Pilate, the Roman governor ([link]John 18:28-19:6[/link]; see note [link]1[sup]2[/sup] in Mark 15[/link]). He was examined until the day of the Passover, when He was crucified ([link]14:12[/link]; [link]John 18:28[/link]; see note [link]12[sup]2[/sup] in Mark 14[/link]). This insidious and ensnaring examination, coming from many angles, took exactly four days, and He passed, proving that He was fully qualified to be the Lamb required by God for the accomplishing of His redemption, that He may pass over the sinners, both Jews and Gentiles.

Concerning the days to come, He did not leave them in darkness; rather, He told them (1) concerning the destruction of the temple, which would occur in A.D. 70 ([link]vv. 1-2[/link]); (2) concerning the plagues at the beginning of birth pangs, which would begin after His ascension and continue until the great tribulation ([link]vv. 3-8[/link]); (3) concerning the preaching of the gospel and the persecutions in the church age ([link]vv. 9-13[/link]); (4) concerning the great tribulation and His second coming, both of which will take place in the last three and a half years of this age ([link]vv. 14-27[/link]); and (5) concerning watching, praying, and awaiting the Slave-Savior throughout the church age ([link]vv. 28-37[/link]).

[link]Luke 22:21-23[/link] seems to indicate that Judas left after the Lord's supper, which is mentioned in [link]Luke 22:19-20[/link]. However, Mark's record, like Matthew's, shows that Judas was identified by the Slave-Savior as His betrayer ([link]vv. 18-21[/link]) before He instituted His supper ([link]vv. 22-24[/link]).

        <note num="2">This was the eating of the Slave-Savior's supper, after He and His followers had eaten the passover feast in [link]vv. 16-18[/link]. He initiated this new feast, which was for His believers' remembrance of Him, to replace the passover feast, the old testament feast for the elect's remembrance of Jehovah's salvation ([link]Exo. 12:14[/link]; [link]13:3[/link]). This new feast of the new testament is for the remembering of the Slave-Savior through the eating of the bread, which signifies His body given for His believers ([link]1 Cor. 11:24[/link]), and the drinking of the cup, which signifies His blood shed for their sins ([link]Matt. 26:28[/link]). The bread denotes life ([link]John 6:35[/link]), the life of God, the eternal life, and the cup denotes blessing ([link]1 Cor. 10:16[/link]), which is God Himself as the believers' portion ([link]Psa. 16:5[/link]). As sinners, the believers should have had the cup of God's wrath as their portion ([link]Rev. 14:10[/link]). But the Slave-Savior drank that cup for them ([link]John 18:11[/link]), and His salvation became their portion, the cup of salvation ([link]Psa. 116:13[/link]) that runs over ([link]Psa. 23:5[/link]), the content of which is God as the believers' all-inclusive blessing. Such a bread and such a cup are the constituents of the Slave-Savior's supper, which is a table ([link]1 Cor. 10:21[/link]), a feast, set up by Him that His believers may remember Him by enjoying Him as such a feast. Thus, as His believers remember Him, they display His redeeming and life-imparting death ([link]1 Cor. 11:26[/link] &amp;#8212; His blood separated from His body declares His death), testifying to the entire universe of His rich and marvelous salvation.</note>

The Slave-Savior came to accomplish God's eternal redemption for God's chosen people by His death, according to God's will ([link]Heb. 10:7[/link], [link]9-10[/link]), and with His blood He instituted a new covenant, a better covenant ([link]Heb. 8:6-13[/link]), which after His resurrection became the new testament ([link]Heb. 9:16-17[/link]), as a base from which God can be one with His redeemed and regenerated people in the dispensation of grace. This new covenant replaced the old covenant and at the same time changed God's old dispensation to His new dispensation. The Slave-Savior wanted His followers to know this and to live a life based on this and according to this after His resurrection.</note>

        <note num="1">The Triune God determined in His divine plan in eternity past that the Second of the Divine Trinity should be incarnated and die on the cross to accomplish His eternal redemption for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose ([link]Eph. 1:7-9[/link]). Hence, before the foundation of the world, that is, in eternity past ([link]1 Pet. 1:19-20[/link]), the Second of the Divine Trinity was ordained to be the Lamb of God ([link]John 1:29[/link]); and in the eyes of God He was slain as the Lamb of God from the foundation of the world, that is, from the creation of God's creatures, who became fallen ([link]Rev. 13:8[/link]). From the time of man's fall, lambs, sheep, calves, and bulls were used as types for God's chosen people ([link]Gen. 3:21[/link]; [link]4:4[/link]; [link]8:20[/link]; [link]22:13[/link]; [link]Exo. 12:3-8[/link]; [link]Lev. 1:2[/link]), pointing to Him who was to come as the real Lamb foreordained by God. In the fullness of time the Triune God sent the Second of the Divine Trinity, the Son of God, to come in incarnation to take a human body ([link]Heb. 10:5[/link]) that He might be offered to God on the cross ([link]Heb. 9:14[/link]; [link]10:12[/link]) to do the will of the Triune God ([link]Heb. 10:7[/link]), that is, to replace the sacrifices and offerings, which were types, with Himself in His humanity as the unique sacrifice and offering for the sanctification of God's chosen people ([link]Heb. 10:9-10[/link]). In His prayer here, immediately before His crucifixion, He prepared Himself to take the cup of the cross ([link]Matt. 26:39[/link], [link]42[/link]), being willing to do this unique will of the Father for the accomplishing of the eternal plan of the Triune God.</note>

Hence, all things, whether on earth or in the heavens, were reconciled to God, and the gospel should be proclaimed to (in) all creation under heaven ([link]Col. 1:20[/link], [link]23[/link]). Based on this, all the creation expects to be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God ([link]Rom. 8:19-22[/link]).</note>

        <text>He who [note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]believes and is [xref]b[/xref]baptized shall be [xref]c[/xref]saved, but he who does [note]2[/note][xref]d[/xref]not believe shall be condemned.</text>
        <note num="1">To believe (see note [link]15[sup]3[/sup] in ch. 1[/link]) is to receive the Slave-Savior ([link]John 1:12[/link]) not only for forgiveness of sins ([link]Acts 10:43[/link]) but also for regeneration ([link]1 Pet. 1:21[/link], [link]23[/link]). Those who thus believe become the children of God ([link]John 1:12-13[/link]) and the members of Christ ([link]Eph. 5:30[/link]) in an organic union with the Triune God ([link]Matt. 28:19[/link]). To be baptized is to affirm this by being buried to terminate the old creation through the death of the Slave-Savior and by being raised up to be the new creation of God through the Slave-Savior's resurrection. Such a baptism is much more advanced than the baptism of repentance preached by John ([link]1:4[/link]; [link]Acts 19:3-5[/link]). To believe and to be so baptized are two parts of one complete step for receiving the full salvation of God. To be baptized without believing is merely an empty ritual; to believe without being baptized is to be saved only inwardly without an outward affirmation of the inward salvation. These two should go together. Moreover, water baptism should be accompanied by Spirit baptism, even as the children of Israel were baptized in the sea (water) and in the cloud (the Spirit) &amp;#8212; [link]1 Cor. 10:2[/link]; [link]12:13[/link].</note>
        <note num="2">Here the verse does not say, "He who does not believe and is not baptized." This indicates that condemnation is related only to not believing; it is not related to not being baptized. Believing, by itself, is sufficient in order to receive salvation from condemnation; yet for the completion of one's inward salvation, believing needs baptism as an outward affirmation.</note>

        <note num="1">Speaking with new tongues is only one of the five signs that accompany saved believers. It is not the unique sign, contrary to what is stressed by some believers. According to the divine revelation in the Acts and the Epistles, what the Lord said here does not mean that every saved believer should have all five signs. It means that each saved believer may have some of these signs but will not necessarily have all.</note>
