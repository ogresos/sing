        <verse num="1">
        <text>[note]1[/note]Paul, a [note]2[/note]slave of [note]3[/note]Christ [note]4[/note]Jesus, a [note]5[/note]called [note]6[/note]apostle, [note]7[/note]separated [note]8[/note]unto the [note]9[/note]gospel of God,</text>
        <note num="1">Formerly Saul, who persecuted the believers and devastated the church ([link]Acts 7:58-8:1a[/link]; [link]8:3[/link]; [link]9:1[/link]). After he was saved, when he went forth to preach the gospel, his name was changed to Paul ([link]Acts 13:9[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">A slave, according to ancient custom and law, was one who was purchased by his master and over whom his master had absolute rights, even to the extent of terminating his life. Paul was such a slave of Christ. Verbs formed from this word are used several times throughout this book. One is translated [i]serve as a slave[/i] in [link]6:6[/link] and [i]serve[/i] in [link]7:6[/link], [link]25[/link]; [link]9:12[/link]; [link]12:11[/link]; [link]14:18[/link]; and [link]16:18[/link]. Another is translated [i]enslaved[/i] in [link]6:18[/link], [link]22[/link]. The noun [i]slavery,[/i] from the same root as [i]slave,[/i] is used in [link]8:15[/link], [link]21[/link].[br][br]Paul's use of this term indicates that he was not a self-appointed apostle or one hired by the Lord; rather, he was one purchased to serve God and minister to His people, not in the natural life but in the regenerated life (see [link]Exo. 12:44[/link]; [link]21:6[/link]; note [link]26[sup]1[/sup] in Matt. 20[/link]; note [link]14[sup]3[/sup] in Matt. 25[/link]; and note [link]17[sup]1[/sup] in Gal. 6[/link]).</note>
        <note num="3">[i]Christ,[/i] equal to [i]Messiah[/i] in Hebrew, means [i]the anointed One[/i] ([link]John 1:41[/link]; [link]Dan. 9:26[/link]). This book explains how the individual Christ revealed in the four Gospels could become the corporate Christ revealed in Acts, collectively composed of Himself with all the believers. By means of the facts in the Scriptures and the experience in the Holy Spirit, Paul shows us that God's New Testament economy is to make sinners sons of God and members of Christ to constitute the Body of Christ to express Him. This book offers a full definition of this, God's goal, unfolding a general sketch and details of both the Christian life and the church life.[br][br]This book may be divided into eight sections: introduction, condemnation, justification, sanctification, glorification, selection, transformation, and conclusion. In these eight sections three major structures can be seen: salvation ([link]1:1-5:11[/link]; [link]9:1-11:36[/link]), life ([link]5:12-8:39[/link]), and building ([link]12:1-16:27[/link]).</note>
        <note num="4">[i]Jesus,[/i] equal to [i]Joshua[/i] in Hebrew, means [i]the salvation of Jehovah,[/i] or [i]Jehovah the Savior[/i] ([link]Matt. 1:21[/link]; [link]Num. 13:16[/link]; [link]Heb. 4:8[/link]).</note>
        <note num="5">[i]Called[/i] includes the thought of being appointed (cf. [link]1 Cor. 12:28[/link]).</note>
        <note num="6">I.e., a sent one (see note [link]1[sup]3[/sup], par. 2, in 1 Cor. 9[/link]).</note>
        <note num="7">Being separated includes being chosen ([link]Acts 9:15[/link]), being appointed ([link]1 Tim. 2:7[/link]), and being sent ([link]Acts 13:2-4[/link]).</note>
        <note num="8">Or, for the gospel; including the proclamation ([link]1 Tim. 2:7[/link]; [link]2 Tim. 1:11[/link]) and the defense and confirmation ([link]Phil. 1:7[/link]) of the gospel.</note>
        <note num="9">Lit., glad tidings, good news ([link]vv. 9[/link], [link]16[/link]; [link]2:16[/link]; [link]10:16[/link]; [link]11:28[/link]; [link]15:16[/link], [link]19[/link]; [link]16:25[/link]). The gospel of God, as the subject of this book, concerns Christ as the Spirit living within the believers after His resurrection. This is higher and more subjective than what was presented in the Gospels, which concern Christ only in the flesh as He lived among His disciples after His incarnation but before His death and resurrection. This book, however, reveals that Christ has resurrected and has become the life-giving Spirit ([link]8:9-10[/link]). He is no longer merely the Christ outside the believers, but He is now the Christ within them. Hence, the gospel in this book is the gospel of the One who is now indwelling His believers as their subjective Savior.</note>

        <note num="1">[link]Verses 2-6[/link] may be considered a parenthetical word explaining the gospel of God.</note>
        <note num="2">The gospel of God was not something added along the way by accident; it was planned and prepared by God in eternity past and promised by God through His prophets in many ways ([link]Gen. 3:15[/link]; [link]22:18[/link]; [link]Gal. 3:16[/link]; [link]2 Tim. 1:9[/link]; [link]Titus 1:2[/link]).</note>
        <note num="3">The Greek words [i]hagios, hagiosune, hagiazo,[/i] and [i]hagiasmos,[/i] used in this book, are of the same root, which fundamentally means [i]separated, set apart. Hagios[/i] is translated [i]holy[/i] in [link]v. 2[/link]; [link]5:5[/link]; [link]7:12[/link]; [link]9:1[/link]; [link]11:16[/link]; [link]12:1[/link]; [link]14:17[/link]; [link]15:13[/link], [link]16[/link]; [link]16:16[/link], and [i]saints[/i] in [link]v. 7[/link]; [link]8:27[/link]; [link]12:13[/link]; [link]15:25[/link], [link]26[/link], [link]31[/link]; [link]16:15[/link]. [i]Hagiosune[/i] is translated [i]holiness[/i] in [link]v. 4[/link]. [i]Hagiazo[/i] is a verb used as a participle and is translated [i]sanctified[/i] in [link]15:16[/link]. [i]Hagiasmos[/i] is translated [i]sanctification[/i] in [link]6:19[/link], [link]22[/link]. Hence, to be holy is to be separated, set apart (to God). The saints are the separated ones, the ones set apart (to God). Holiness is the nature and quality of being holy. Sanctification (to God) is the practical effect, the character in activity, and the consummate state produced by being sanctified.</note>

        <note num="1">The gospel of God concerns the Son of God, Jesus Christ our Lord. This wonderful person has two natures &amp;#8212; the divine nature ([link]v. 4[/link]) and the human nature ([link]v. 3[/link]), divinity and humanity.</note>
        <note num="2">Lit., became.</note>
        <note num="3">[i]Out of,[/i] a literal translation of the Greek [i]ek,[/i] is used here and again in the next verse, referring to the two sources of Christ's being: one, the seed of David, the other, the resurrection of the dead.</note>
        <note num="4">[i]The seed of David[/i] implies Christ's human nature. By incarnation, the first step of Christ's process, God was brought into humanity.</note>
        <note num="5">In the Bible [i]flesh[/i] is not a positive word. Nevertheless, the Bible declares that the Word became flesh ([link]John 1:14[/link]). The gospel of God concerns God who became flesh; according to the flesh He became the seed of a man (see note [link]3[sup]3[/sup] in ch. 8[/link]).</note>

        <text>Who was [note]1[/note]designated the [note]2[/note][xref]a[/xref]Son of God in [note]3[/note]power according to the [note]4[/note]Spirit of [note]5[/note]holiness [note]6[/note]out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord;</text>
        <note num="1">Or, marked out. Before His incarnation Christ, the divine One, already was the Son of God ([link]John 1:18[/link]; [link]Rom. 8:3[/link]). By incarnation He put on an element, the human flesh, which had nothing to do with divinity; that part of Him needed to be sanctified and uplifted by passing through death and resurrection. By resurrection His human nature was sanctified, uplifted, and transformed. Hence, by resurrection He was designated the Son of God with His humanity ([link]Acts 13:33[/link]; [link]Heb. 1:5[/link]). His resurrection was His designation. Now, as the Son of God, He possesses humanity as well as divinity. By incarnation He brought God into man; by resurrection He brought man into God, that is, He brought His humanity into the divine sonship. In this way the only begotten Son of God was made the firstborn Son of God, possessing both divinity and humanity. God is using such a Christ, the firstborn Son, who possesses both divinity and humanity, as the producer and as the prototype, the model, to produce His many sons ([link]8:29-30[/link]) &amp;#8212; we who have believed in and received His Son. We too will be designated and revealed as the sons of God, as He was in the glory of His resurrection ([link]8:19[/link], [link]21[/link]), and with Him we will express God.</note>
        <note num="2">This book tells us that God's full salvation is to make sinners ([link]3:23[/link]), even His enemies ([link]5:10[/link]), the sons of God ([link]8:14[/link]). Through resurrection God designated Christ, who became flesh to be the seed of David, as His Son, that His Son, who is the mingling of divinity and humanity, might be the base and pattern for His making sinners His many sons. It is in the resurrection of His Son, i.e., in the resurrected Son, that God is producing many sons ([link]1 Pet. 1:3[/link]) as the many brothers of the Firstborn ([link]8:29[/link]), who was resurrected from the dead, and as the members of His Firstborn to constitute the Body of His Firstborn ([link]12:5[/link]), which is His fullness ([link]Eph. 1:23[/link]), His corporate expression.</note>
        <note num="3">The reality of the power of Christ's resurrection is the Spirit (see notes in [link]Eph. 1:19-22[/link] and note [link]10[sup]2[/sup] in Phil. 3[/link]).</note>
        <note num="4">The Spirit of holiness here is in contrast to the flesh in [link]v. 3[/link]. As the flesh in [link]v. 3[/link] refers to the human nature of Christ in the flesh, so the Spirit in this verse does not refer to the person of the Holy Spirit of God but to the divine essence of Christ. This divine essence of Christ, being God the Spirit Himself ([link]John 4:24[/link]), the divinity of Christ, is of holiness, full of the nature and quality of being holy.</note>

        <note num="1">Grace is God in Christ as life and the life supply (see note [link]14[sup]6[/sup] in John 1[/link]). It affords the apostles salvation and life and becomes the capacity and supply for their apostleship ([link]1 Cor. 15:9-10[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">I.e., sending forth, or mission.</note>
        <note num="3">God's unique commandment in this age, the age of grace, is that man should believe into His Son, the Lord Jesus. Whoever believes into Him will be saved; whoever does not believe has been condemned already, because he has not believed into Him ([link]John 3:18[/link]). The Holy Spirit convicts the world of the sin of not believing into the Lord ([link]John 16:8-9[/link]), of not obeying God's unique commandment. When we believe into the Lord, we have the obedience of faith, and the result is grace and peace ([link]v. 7[/link]).</note>
        <note num="4">In the New Testament the complete gospel according to God's New Testament revelation is the content of the faith, with the two natures of Christ, who is both God and man, and the redemptive work accomplished through His death and resurrection as its center (see note [link]1[sup]1[/sup], par. 2, in 1 Tim. 1[/link]). To obey this faith is to turn from all pagan religions and philosophies unto this faith, believing and receiving it.</note>

        <note num="1">The Greek word means [i]serve in worship;[/i] it is used in [link]Matt. 4:10[/link]; [link]2 Tim. 1:3[/link]; [link]Phil. 3:3[/link]; and [link]Luke 2:37[/link]. Paul considered his preaching of the gospel a worship and service to God, not merely a work.</note>
        <note num="2">Not the Spirit of God but Paul's regenerated spirit. The spirit is different from the heart, soul, mind, emotion, will, or natural life. Christ and the Spirit are with the believers in their regenerated human spirit ([link]2 Tim. 4:22[/link]; [link]Rom. 8:16[/link]). In this book Paul stressed that whatever we are ([link]2:29[/link]; [link]8:5-6[/link], [link]9[/link]), whatever we have ([link]8:10[/link], [link]16[/link]), and whatever we do toward God ([link]v. 9[/link]; [link]7:6[/link]; [link]8:4[/link], [link]13[/link]; [link]12:11[/link]) must be in this spirit. Paul served God in his regenerated spirit by the indwelling Christ, the life-giving Spirit, not in his soul by the power and ability of the soul. This is the first important item in his preaching of the gospel.</note>

        <note num="1">In [link]John 3:16[/link] God's love is the source and motive of God's salvation. In [link]Eph. 2:5[/link], [link]8[/link] God's grace is the means of God's salvation. Here God's righteousness is the power of God's salvation. God's righteousness, which is solid and steadfast, is the foundation of His throne ([link]Psa. 89:14[/link]) and the base on which His kingdom is built ([link]Rom. 14:17[/link]). Legally, both love and grace can fluctuate, but righteousness cannot. It is even more so with God's righteousness. It is God's righteousness, not ours, that is revealed in the gospel of God. Hence, the gospel is the power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes.</note>

        <note num="1">This book begins with man's fall (in contrast to Ephesians, which begins with God's selection and predestination in eternity past); continues through Christ's redemption, God's justification, sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification; and, finally, touches the mystery of God in eternity past ([link]16:25[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">In the preceding verse the righteousness of God is revealed in the gospel to faith; here, the wrath of God is revealed from heaven upon all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men. This shows a contrast between the revelation of God's righteousness and the revelation of God's wrath. Originally, the wrath of God was revealed from heaven upon all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men. However, since the gospel of God has come, the scene has changed. Now the righteousness of God is revealed in the gospel to our faith.</note>

This reality is the sure fact that God and His existence are proved by the creation, and it is the definite fact that men, being without excuse, can know God by the creation. This great reality, this great truth, should cause men to know God and thereby to glorify Him and thank Him ([link]v. 21[/link]). However, instead of dealing properly with this reality, this truth, according to righteousness, in which God delights, men held down the truth in unrighteousness, which God hates, and did not approve of knowing God ([link]v. 28[/link]). Therefore, they despised and rejected God, changing the glory of God into idols ([link]vv. 21-23[/link]) and casting off self-restraint to fall without limit ([link]vv. 24-32[/link]), so that they were given up, abandoned, by God ([link]vv. 24[/link], [link]26[/link], [link]28[/link]).</note>

It is different from [i]theotes[/i] in [link]Col. 2:9[/link], which denotes God's Godhead and person. The characteristics of God's nature can be verified through the created things; however, the created things cannot manifest God's Godhead and person. Only the living person of Jesus Christ, the Word who is God and who declares God ([link]John 1:1[/link], [link]18[/link]), can express God's Godhead and person, that is, the very God, God Himself. Here, in this chapter, the apostle Paul speaks of the created things verifying God's existence, but what is verified are only the attributes and characteristics of God. In [link]Col. 2:9[/link] he speaks of Christ as the embodiment of God, and what is expressed is the Godhead and God's person, that is, God Himself.</note>
        <note num="2">Man can perceive the invisible things of God by observing the visible things created by Him. Both the eternal power of God and the divine characteristics that express God's intrinsic nature are manifested in God's creation. For example, the abundance of light in the universe shows that light is a divine characteristic, a divine attribute of the divine nature ([link]James 1:17[/link]). The same is true of beauty and life.</note>

        <note num="1">In this chapter Paul's presentation of God's creation and man's step-by-step fall is undoubtedly based on the historical facts as recorded in [link]Gen. 1-19[/link] and in subsequent books of the Old Testament.

This object is Jesus, who is God incarnate. When man hears Him, knows Him, appreciates Him, and treasures Him, He causes faith to be generated in man, enabling man to believe in Him. Thus, He becomes the faith in man by which man believes in Him. Hence, this faith becomes the faith in Him, and it is also the faith that belongs to Him.[br][br]In God's New Testament economy, God desires that man believe in Jesus, who is God incarnate. If man does not believe in Him, he commits the unique sin before God ([link]John 16:9[/link]). However, if man believes in Him, he is righteous to the uttermost before God, and God reckons this faith as his righteousness. At the same time, this faith brings its object, that is, this One who is God incarnate, into those who believe in Him. He is God's righteousness, and God has given Him as righteousness to those who are indwelt by Him ([link]Jer. 23:6[/link]).

        <text>Whom God [note]1[/note]set forth as a [note]2[/note][xref]a[/xref]propitiation place through faith in His blood, for the demonstrating of His righteousness, in that in His forbearance God [note]3[/note]passed over the sins that had previously occurred,</text>
        <note num="1">In the Old Testament, the expiation cover, the lid of the Ark, as a type, was hidden in the Holy of Holies; in the New Testament, Christ as the propitiation place, the reality of the expiation cover, is openly set forth before all men.</note>
        <note num="2">The propitiation place is typified in [link]Exo. 25:17[/link] by the sin-covering lid on the Ark. The Ark was the place where God met with people. In the Ark was the law of the Ten Commandments, which by its holy and righteous requirement exposed and condemned the sins of the people who came to contact God. However, by the lid of the Ark, with the propitiating blood sprinkled on it on the Day of Expiation, the entire situation on the sinner's side was fully covered. Therefore, upon this sin-covering lid God could meet with the people who broke His righteous law, and He could do this without, governmentally, any contradiction to His righteousness, even under the observing of the cherubim that bore His glory and overshadowed the lid of the Ark. Thus, the problem between man and God was appeased, enabling God to forgive and be merciful to man and thereby to give His grace to man. This is a prefigure of Christ as the Lamb of God taking away the sin that caused man to have a problem with God ([link]John 1:29[/link]), thus satisfying all the requirements of God's holiness, righteousness, and glory and appeasing the relationship between man and God. Hence, God could pass over the people's sins that had previously occurred. And, in order to show forth His righteousness, He had to do this. This is what this verse refers to.[br][br]The Hebrew word for the lid of the Ark is [i]kapporeth,[/i] from a root meaning [i]to cover.[/i] In the Septuagint this word is translated [i]hilasterion,[/i] which means [i]the place of propitiation[/i] (implying to forgive and to give mercy &amp;#8212; the word rendered [i]propitious[/i] in [link]Heb. 8:12[/link] is the root of [i]hilasterion,[/i] and the word rendered [i]propitiated[/i] in [link]Luke 18:13[/link] is derived from this root). The King James Version adopts the rendering "mercy seat," referring to the place where God grants mercy to man. In [link]Heb. 9:5[/link] Paul also used [i]hilasterion[/i] for the lid of the Ark. Here, in [link]Rom. 3:25[/link], the same word, [i]hilasterion,[/i] is used to show that the lid of the Ark signifies Christ as the propitiation place set forth by God.[br][br]In addition to [i]hilasterion,[/i] two other words derived from the same Greek word as [i]hilasterion[/i] are used in the New Testament to show how Christ took away man's sin to appease the relationship between man and God. One is [i]hilaskomai[/i] ([link]Heb. 2:17[/link]), which means [i]to propitiate,[/i] that is, [i]to appease,[/i] to reconcile one by satisfying the other's demand; the other is [i]hilasmos[/i] ([link]1 John 2:2[/link]; [link]4:10[/link]), which means [i]that which propitiates,[/i] that is, a propitiatory sacrifice. Christ made propitiation for our sins ([link]Heb. 2:17[/link]); hence, He has become that which propitiates, the propitiatory sacrifice, between us and God ([link]1 John 2:2[/link]; [link]4:10[/link]), and He has also become the place, as typified by the lid of the Ark ([link]Heb. 9:5[/link]), where we enjoy propitiation before God and where God gives grace to us.</note>
        <note num="3">During the Old Testament time, the sins of the people were not taken away but were only covered with the blood of the animal sacrifices, which were types of Christ. God passed over these covered sins until Christ came. He was the Lamb of God who took away the sin of the world ([link]John 1:29[/link]). By His death on the cross and the shedding of His blood for redemption, He carried away all the sins that had been previously covered and passed over. In passing over their sins, God demonstrated His righteousness to the Old Testament saints.</note>

        <text>[note]1[/note]What then shall we say that Abraham our [note]2[/note]forefather according to the flesh has found?</text>
        <note num="1">After dealing in [link]ch. 3[/link] with the objective, positional justification accomplished by the death of Christ, Paul in this chapter shows the subjective, dispositional justification carried out by the resurrection of Christ. He uses Abraham as the example to show that adequate, living justification is God's deeper work in calling fallen people out of everything other than God and bringing them back to Himself, so that they place their full trust in Him rather than in themselves. In [link]Gen. 15[/link] Abraham's being justified by God was not related to sin; rather, it was for the gaining of a seed to produce a kingdom that will inherit the world ([link]v. 13[/link]). Likewise, this chapter indicates that justification is not merely for man to be delivered out of God's condemnation, but even more for God to gain many sons ([link]8:29-30[/link]) to constitute the one Body of Christ ([link]ch. 12[/link]) as the kingdom of God ([link]14:17[/link]) for the fulfillment of His purpose. The objective, positional justification covered in [link]ch. 3[/link] is related to redemption, through which man may be reconciled to God; the subjective, dispositional justification covered in [link]ch. 4[/link] is related to life, through which men may become heirs for the fulfillment of God's purpose. This requires that man's flesh and his natural ability be cut off, circumcised.</note>
        <note num="2">Abraham is the forefather of all believers, of both the uncircumcision who have the same faith and the circumcision who walk in the steps of the same faith.</note>

        <text>For if Abraham was justified out of [note]1[/note]works, he has something to boast in, but not before God.</text>
        <note num="1">This refers to Abraham's doing something for God by himself, as seen in his attempts to have God accept the fruit of his efforts (first Lot, then Eliezer, then Ishmael, who was born through Hagar) as God's promised seed. The result of Abraham's being justified, however, was that he eventually stopped his own work for God. This was signified by circumcision ([link]v. 11[/link]), which is the cutting off of the flesh. Hence, circumcision became God's constant reminder to Abraham to stop his own doing and live by faith in God. Justification has nothing to do with the works and accomplishments of the flesh.</note>

        <verse num="3">
        <text>For what does the Scripture say? [xref]a[/xref]"And Abraham [note]1[/note]believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness."</text>
        <note num="1">Believing God was Abraham's spontaneous reaction to God's repeated appearing to him. God appeared to Abraham a number of times ([link]Gen. 12:1-3[/link], [link]7[/link]; [link]13:14-17[/link]; [link]15:1-7[/link]; [link]ch. 18[/link]; [link]Acts 7:2[/link]), each time transfusing something of His glory, something of Himself, into Abraham. Hence, Abraham's believing was actually the springing up within him of the very element that God had transfused into him. God's reaction to Abraham's believing was to justify him, that is, to account him righteous. This accounting was not out of works but was based on his believing God.</note>

        <note num="2">God's justification is not a reward (wages) for our good works (labor); it is grace freely given to us through Christ's redemption. If God's justification were based on our good works, or if it required our good works, then it would be the wages we earn for our good works; that is, it would be something owed to us, not something freely given by God. Since God's justification is reckoned according to His grace, it is no longer out of works; otherwise, grace is no longer grace ([link]11:6[/link]).

        <note num="1">Circumcision was not the reason that Abraham was justified; rather, it was the outward sign and confirmation that God had already justified him.

Here it refers to walking in the steps by observing the elements of the faith. If one walks in the steps of Abraham's faith, Abraham becomes the father of circumcision to him, and this one enters into a life in which he does not trust in himself but in God, with the result that he is justified subjectively and thus becomes His genuine heir.</note>

        <note num="2">The law was God's temporary economy (dispensation) for man in the Old Testament, since it was added temporarily because of man's transgressions ([link]Gal. 3:19[/link]); the faith is God's eternal economy (dispensation) for man in the New Testament, because it is based on God's eternal plan (cf. note [link]4[sup]4[/sup] in 1 Tim. 1[/link]). In the Old Testament God dealt with man according to the law. If, according to that dispensation of God, man would have done what God commanded in the law, he would have obtained righteousness, that is, the righteousness of the law ([link]9:31[/link]), the righteousness which is out of the law ([link]10:5[/link]; [link]Phil. 3:9[/link]). In the New Testament God deals with man according to the faith. If, according to this dispensation of God, man believes in Christ, the One in whom God has ordained that man should believe ([link]1 John 3:23[/link]), he will obtain righteousness, that is, the righteousness of faith ([link]v. 11[/link]), the righteousness which is out of faith ([link]9:30[/link]; [link]10:6[/link]). The faith, which is ordained by God in the New Testament economy and which replaces the law of the Old Testament, did not come until the New Testament time ([link]Gal. 3:23[/link], [link]25[/link]). This faith, which replaces the law, is objective to us. When according to this objective faith we believe subjectively in Christ, in whom God intended that we believe, we receive the righteousness of faith. This righteousness is the Christ whom we possess &amp;#8212; whom we receive by our subjective believing according to the objective faith ordained by God &amp;#8212; as God's righteousness received by us ([link]1 Cor. 1:30[/link]).</note>

The first four chapters of this book discourse comprehensively regarding the redemption accomplished by Christ's death, whereas the last twelve chapters speak in detail concerning the saving afforded by Christ's life. Before [link]5:11[/link], Paul shows us that we are saved because we have been redeemed, justified, and reconciled to God. However, we have not yet been saved to the extent of being sanctified, transformed, and conformed to the image of God's Son. Redemption, justification, and reconciliation, which are accomplished outside of us by the death of Christ, redeem us objectively; sanctification, transformation, and conformation, which are accomplished within us by the working of Christ's life, save us subjectively. Objective redemption redeems us positionally from condemnation and eternal punishment; subjective salvation saves us dispositionally from our old man, our self, and our natural life.</note>
        <note num="3">Being reconciled to God through Christ's death is an accomplished matter, but being saved in His life from so many negative things unto glorification is a daily matter.</note>
        <note num="4">To be saved in Christ's life is to be saved in Christ Himself as life. He dwells in us, and we are organically one with Him.

        <text>But [note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]death reigned from [note]2[/note]Adam until Moses, even over those who had not sinned after the likeness of Adam's [note]3[/note]transgression, [xref]b[/xref]who is a [note]4[/note]type of Him who was to come.</text>
        <note num="1">Death is mentioned many times in [link]chs. 5-8[/link] ([link]vv. 12[/link], [link]14[/link], [link]17[/link], [link]21[/link]; [link]6:9[/link], [link]16[/link], [link]21[/link], [link]23[/link]; [link]7:5[/link], [link]10[/link], [link]13[/link], [link]24[/link]; [link]8:2[/link], [link]6[/link], [link]38[/link]). Life also is mentioned repeatedly in these chapters ([link]vv. 10[/link], [link]17-18[/link], [link]21[/link]; [link]6:4[/link], [link]22-23[/link]; [link]7:10[/link]; [link]8:2[/link], [link]6[/link], [link]10-11[/link], [link]38[/link]). These two key words form two contrasting lines through [link]chs. 5-8[/link], the line of life and the line of death, showing that man is at the center of a triangular situation between God and Satan, life and death. Thus, [link]chs. 5-8[/link] of Romans can be called the kernel of the Bible, showing its entire theme in a concrete and detailed way.</note>
        <note num="2">From Adam to Moses was the dispensation before law (without law); from Moses to Christ ([link]John 1:17[/link]) was the dispensation of law; from Christ's first coming to the restoration of all things ([link]Acts 3:20-21[/link]) is the dispensation of grace; and from Christ's second coming to the end of the millennium ([link]Rev. 11:15[/link]; [link]20:4[/link], [link]6[/link]) is the dispensation of the kingdom. These dispensations are used by God to accomplish His work of the new creation in the old creation.</note>
        <note num="3">In this chapter the words [i]transgression, offense,[/i] and [i]disobedience[/i] all refer to the fall of Adam, which consisted in his leaving life and choosing death. Adam forsook the tree of life, which denotes God as life, to pursue the tree of knowledge, which signifies Satan as the source of death ([link]Gen. 2:8-9[/link], [link]17[/link]; [link]3:1-7[/link]).</note>
        <note num="4">Adam was the head of the old collective man (mankind). Whatever he did and whatever happened to him is participated in by all mankind. In this respect he is a type of Christ, who is the Head of the new corporate man, the church ([link]Eph. 2:15-16[/link]). Whatever He did and whatever happened to Him is participated in by all the members of His Body, the church ([link]Eph. 1:22-23[/link]).</note>

Subjective righteousness ([link]4:25b[/link]) comes from grace ([link]vv. 17[/link], [link]19[/link]), and grace comes from objective righteousness ([link]vv. 1-2[/link]).</note>
        <note num="3">The life we have received does not merely save us from a few things; rather, it enthrones us as kings to reign over all things. This is much higher than being saved in life. We have received righteousness objectively, but we still need to continually receive the abundance of grace so that we can reign in life subjectively. This reigning is defined in [link]chs. 6-16[/link]; all the matters expounded there are the issue not of our endeavoring but of our receiving the abundance of grace.</note>

        <note num="2">Life is the goal of God's salvation; thus, justification is "of life." Justification is not an end in itself; it is for life. Through justification we have come up to the standard of God's righteousness and correspond with it, so that now He can impart His life to us. Justification changes our outward position; life changes our inward disposition. Justification unto life indicates that life is the focus of this chapter and that the organic union of life is an issue of justification.</note>

        <note num="1">Whether we are sinners or are righteous depends not on our actions but on our inward constitution. Through his fall Adam received an element that was not created by God. This was the satanic nature, which became the constituting essence and main element of fallen man. It is this constituting essence and element that constituted all men sinners. We are not sinners because we sin; we sin because we are sinners. Whether we do good or evil, in Adam we have been constituted sinners. This is due to our inward element, not our outward actions.[br][br]In contrast, Christ constitutes us righteous. When He, the living God, comes into our being as grace, we are constituted righteous. He becomes the constituting essence and element in us that can transform us from sinners into sons of God. He alone is able to accomplish such a reconstituting work.</note>

        <note num="2">Righteousness is the footing, the base, and the means for God to dispense Himself to us as grace. This righteousness gives us the ground to claim Christ as our grace. By giving grace to us, God manifests His righteousness (see [link]1:17[/link]). Furthermore, the power of this grace operates in us and produces subjective righteousness, making us right with God, with others, and even with ourselves; and it not only subdues sin but also overcomes Satan and death in our being. Thus grace reigns through righteousness, resulting in eternal life.</note>

The body of sin is not the sinning person but the sinning instrument utilized by the old man to express himself by committing sins, thereby causing the body of sin to become the flesh.

        <note num="2">Sanctification (see note [link]2[sup]3[/sup] in ch. 1[/link]) involves not only a change in position, that is, a separation from a common, worldly position to a position for God, as illustrated in [link]Matt. 23:17[/link], [link]19[/link] and in [link]1 Tim. 4:3-5[/link]; it involves also a transformation in disposition, that is, a transformation from the natural disposition to a spiritual one by Christ as the life-giving Spirit saturating all the inward parts of our being with God's nature of holiness, as mentioned in [link]Rom. 12:2[/link] and [link]2 Cor. 3:18[/link].</note>

        <text>Or are you ignorant, brothers (for I speak to those who know the law), that the [note]1[/note]law lords it over the man as long as he lives?</text>
        <note num="1">[link]Verses 1-6[/link] continue [link]6:14[/link] to explain how it is that we are not under the law. On one hand, the law continues to exist, for God has not recalled, annulled, or abolished it. On the other hand, because of the crucifixion of our old man ([link]6:6[/link]), who is the first husband mentioned in these verses, we are no longer under the law and no longer have anything to do with it. Instead, we have become the wife of Christ; that is, we have become those who depend on Christ.</note>
        </verse>
        <verse num="2">
        <text>For the married woman is bound by the [note]1[/note]law to her [note]2[/note]husband while he is living; but if the husband dies, she is discharged from the [note]1[/note]law regarding the husband.</text>
        <note num="1">Because fallen man left his proper position as God's wife and desired to be the husband (see note [link]4[sup]1[/sup][/link]), God gave him the law, which he cannot possibly keep. The law is intended not for the wife but for the husband, and the law was given not that it might be kept but that the old man might be exposed ([link]v. 5[/link]; [link]3:20[/link]; [link]5:20[/link]). Accordingly, this verse refers to the law as "the law regarding the husband."</note>
        <note num="2">The husband here (the first husband) is not the flesh or the law but the old man mentioned in [link]6:6[/link], who has been crucified with Christ. Thus, [link]vv. 1-6[/link] correspond with [link]6:6[/link].</note>
        </verse>
        <verse num="3">
        <text>So then if, while the husband is living, she is joined to [note]1[/note]another man, she will be called an adulteress; but if the husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is not an adulteress, though she is joined to [note]1[/note]another man.</text>

        <note num="1">Since our old man, who was the old husband, has been crucified with Christ ([link]6:6[/link]), we are freed from his law and are joined to the new Husband, Christ, the ever-living One. As believers, we have two statuses. The first [i]you[/i] in this verse refers to us in our old status as the fallen old man, who left the original position of a wife dependent on God and took the self-assuming position of husband and head, independent of God. The second [i]you[/i] in this verse refers to us in our new status as the regenerated new man, restored to our original and proper position as the genuine wife to God ([link]Isa. 54:5[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 11:3[/link]), dependent on Him and taking Him as our Head. We no longer have the old status of the husband, for we have been crucified. We now have only the new status of the proper wife, in which we take Christ as our Husband, and should no longer live according to the old man, i.e., no longer take the old man as our husband.</note>
        <note num="2">This joining indicates that in our new status as a wife, we have an organic union in person, name, life, and existence with Christ in His resurrection.</note>
        <note num="3">As the regenerated new man and the wife to Christ, everything we are and do is now related to God, and God is brought forth by us as the fruit, the overflow, of our life. This is in contrast to the fruit born to death ([link]v. 5[/link]), which was previously brought forth by us as the old man, the old husband.</note>

        <note num="1">Since the old man has been crucified, the regenerated new man is now free from the law of the old man ([link]vv. 2-3[/link]; [link]Gal. 2:19[/link]). Since the law was given to the old husband, the old man, not to the wife, and since the old husband, the old man, died on the cross, the new man, the wife, has been discharged from his law.</note>

        <note num="3">In [link]6:4[/link], newness of life issues from our being identified with Christ's resurrection and is for our walk in our daily life. Here, newness of spirit issues from our being discharged from the law and being joined to the resurrected Christ, and is for our service to God. Thus, both newness of spirit and newness of life are results of the crucifixion of the old man.</note>
        <note num="4">Referring to our regenerated human spirit, in which the Lord as the Spirit dwells ([link]2 Tim. 4:22[/link]). Everything that is related to our regenerated spirit is new, and everything that comes out of our spirit is new. Our regenerated spirit is a source of newness because the Lord, the life of God, and the Holy Spirit are there (see note [link]9[sup]2[/sup] in ch. 1[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">In [link]vv. 7-25[/link] Paul used his own experience, which he had before he believed in the Lord, to illustrate the wretchedness of trying to do good under the law in order to please God. Neither the human spirit nor the Spirit of God is mentioned in this section; rather, the will and the mind of the human soul ([link]vv. 19[/link], [link]23[/link]), which attempt to please God with the good of the natural life ([link]vv. 18-19[/link], [link]21[/link]), are referred to. Although this is the situation of an unsaved person, nearly all Christians pass through this kind of experience after they are saved.</note>
        <note num="2">The law portrays God and defines Him ([link]Lev. 19:2[/link]). Accordingly, it places many demands and requirements on fallen man, and in so doing it identifies sin as sin and leads man to the knowledge of sin ([link]3:20[/link]; [link]4:15[/link]; [link]5:20[/link]). In this way man is both exposed and subdued by the law ([link]3:19[/link]).</note>
        <note num="3">The tenth commandment, "You shall not covet," is not related to outward conduct, but rather to the sin within man, mainly in his thoughts. This shows that man's problem is with the sin that indwells him, not just with outward sinful acts.</note>

Now Satan as sin personified is in man's flesh, making his home there and ruling as an illegal master, overruling man and forcing him to do things that he dislikes. It is this indwelling sin, which is the unchangeable evil nature, that constitutes all men sinners ([link]5:19[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">There are three different laws in the three different parts of the believer's being. As revealed in [link]chs. 7[/link] and [link book="Rom."]8[/link], these three laws derive from the three parties in the universe. The law of sin and death in the believer's members ([link]v. 23[/link]), that is, in his body, derives from Satan, who as sin dwells in the believer's flesh. The law of good in the believer's mind ([link]v. 23[/link]), that is, in his soul, derives from the natural human life, that is, from man himself. The law of the Spirit of life in the believer's spirit derives from God, who as the Spirit dwells in his spirit ([link]8:2[/link], [link]16[/link]). These three parties with the three laws are now present in the believer in much the same way that they (God, man, and Satan) were present in the Garden of Eden ([link]Gen. 3[/link]). In addition to the three laws within the believer, there is the law of God outside of him ([link]vv. 22[/link], [link]25[/link]).</note>

The body of sin is strong in sinning against God, but the body of this death is weak in acting to please God. Sin energizes the fallen body to sin, whereas death utterly weakens and disables the corrupted body, so that it cannot keep God's commandments.</note>
        <note num="3">The death caused by sin through the weapon of the law, the death of being defeated, the death of trying to keep the law to please God but instead being made a captive by the law of sin in our members. This is the death that is working in our flesh this very moment.</note>

        <note num="3">In this chapter the phrase [i]in Christ[/i] refers not only to our standing, our position, in Christ, as mentioned in [link]ch. 6[/link], but also to the reality of our daily walk in our regenerated spirit.

        <text>For the [note]1[/note]law of the [note]2[/note]Spirit of [note]3[/note]life has [note]4[/note]freed [note]5[/note]me in Christ Jesus from the [note]6[/note][xref]a[/xref]law of sin and of death.</text>
        <note num="1">The law of the Spirit of life is the subject of this chapter. The Spirit and life are mentioned in this verse, but only in connection with the working of this law. Life is the content and issue of the Spirit, and the Spirit is the ultimate and consummate manifestation of the Triune God after His being processed through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection and becoming the indwelling, life-giving Spirit, who is life to all the believers in Christ. The law that has freed us from the law of sin, which is of Satan, who dwells in the members of our fallen body ([link]Rom. 7:23[/link], [link]17[/link]), is of this Spirit of life. It is this law, not God nor the Spirit, that works in us to deliver us from the working of the law of sin in our flesh and to enable us to know God and gain God and thereby live Him out. This law of the Spirit of life is the spontaneous power of the Spirit of life. Such a spontaneous law works automatically under the condition that fulfills its requirements (see note [link]4[sup]2[/sup][/link]).[br][br]Both Satan and God, after entering into our being and dwelling in us, work within us not by outward, objective activities but by an inward, subjective law. The working of the law of the Spirit of life is the working of the processed Triune God in our spirit; this is also the working of the Triune God in us in His life.</note>
        <note num="2">Here law, the Spirit, and life are in contrast to law, sin, and death. The two laws are in opposition to each other, the Spirit is in opposition to sin, and life is in opposition to death. In [link]ch. 5[/link] grace, which is God embodied in us, is in opposition to sin, which is Satan embodied in us ([link]5:21[/link]). In [link]ch. 8[/link] the Spirit, who is God living in us, is in opposition to sin. Thus, the grace in [link]ch. 5[/link] is the Spirit in [link]ch. 8[/link], the very God embodied in us as grace, living and acting in us.[br][br]In the previous chapters life is mentioned a number of times ([link]1:17[/link]; [link]2:7[/link]; [link]5:10[/link], [link]17-18[/link], [link]21[/link]; [link]6:4[/link], [link]22-23[/link]). In this chapter life is joined with the Spirit in the phrase [i]the Spirit of life,[/i] showing that everything regarding life in the preceding chapters is included in the Spirit in this chapter. Life belongs to the Spirit, and the Spirit is of life. These two are actually one ([link]John 6:63[/link]). The way to experience the divine, eternal, uncreated life is by the Spirit of life.</note>
        <note num="3">The spiritual life revealed in this chapter is fourfold. First, it was the divine life in the Spirit ([link]v. 2[/link]). Second, it became life in our spirit through regeneration ([link]v. 10[/link]). Then from our spirit it saturates our mind for the transformation of our soul, to which our mind belongs, and becomes the life in our soul ([link]v. 6[/link]). Eventually, it will permeate our body and become the life in our body ([link]v. 11[/link]), ultimately issuing in the transfiguration of our body ([link]Phil. 3:21[/link]), that is, the redemption of our body ([link]v. 23[/link]).</note>
        <note num="4">The major function of the processed Triune God in indwelling our spirit as the law of the Spirit of life is to free us completely from Satan, who dwells in our fallen nature as the law of sin and of death ([link]7:23-25[/link]). This freeing is not only for our subjective justification but even more for our dispositional sanctification.</note>
        <note num="5">Some ancient MSS read, you.</note>
        <note num="6">The law of sin, the power to commit sin that arises spontaneously in man, causes man to become a slave of sin ([link]John 8:34[/link]). Thus, man is helpless, is controlled and manipulated by sin, and does many things against his will. The law of death, the natural power that causes man to become weak, to wither up, and to age and die, dwells in man and causes every part of man to enter into decay and death. On one hand, death disables man; on the other hand, it desensitizes man. It causes man to be disabled when he attempts to do good, and to be insensitive when he commits sins.</note>

        <text>For that which the [note]1[/note]law could [note]2[/note]not do, in that it was [xref]a[/xref]weak through the flesh, God, sending His own Son in the [note]3[/note]likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh,</text>
        <note num="1">In the flesh nothing good dwells ([link]7:18[/link]); only sin dwells in the flesh ([link]7:17[/link]). Furthermore, the flesh is of death ([link]7:24[/link]). Hence, no man can be justified before God out of the works of the law through the flesh ([link]3:20[/link]). Because of such a weak and impotent flesh, there is something that the law could not do.</note>
        <note num="2">On one hand, the law of God outside man is a law in letters, is dead, and lacks the power of life to supply man to meet its demands. On the other hand, man's body has been corrupted by Satan to become the flesh of death, and as such is incapable of keeping the law. It is because of these two factors that there is "that which the law could not do"; that is, the law is incapable of pleasing God through man's keeping of it.</note>
        <note num="3">The flesh is of sin, yet the Son of God became flesh ([link]John 1:14[/link]; [link]Heb. 2:14[/link]; [link]1 Tim. 3:16[/link]). However, He was only in the likeness of the flesh and did not have the sin of the flesh ([link]2 Cor. 5:21[/link]; [link]Heb. 4:15[/link]). This was typified by the bronze serpent lifted up by Moses for the sinful Israelites ([link]Num. 21:9[/link]; [link]John 3:14[/link]). The bronze serpent was in the form, the likeness, of the actual serpent but did not have its poison. It was such a bronze serpent that bore God's judgment for the poisoned Israelites and dealt with the serpents that poisoned them.[br][br]Although Christ did not have the sin of the flesh, He was crucified in the flesh ([link]Col. 1:22[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 3:18[/link]). Thus, on the cross He judged Satan, who is related to the flesh, and the world, which hangs on him ([link]John 12:31[/link]; [link]16:11[/link]), thereby destroying Satan ([link]Heb. 2:14[/link]). At the same time, through Christ's crucifixion in the flesh, God condemned sin, which was brought by Satan into man's flesh. As a result, it is possible for us to walk not according to the flesh but according to the spirit that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us ([link]v. 4[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">Not consciously kept by us through our outward endeavoring but spontaneously and unconsciously fulfilled in us by the inward working of the Spirit of life. The Spirit of life is the Spirit of Christ, and Christ corresponds with the law of God. This Spirit within us spontaneously fulfills all the righteous requirements of the law through us when we walk according to Him.</note>
        <note num="2">The Greek word denotes the general walk in our living. See note [link]16[sup]1[/sup] in Gal. 5[/link]. The requirements that we must fulfill in order that the law of the Spirit of life (which has already been installed in us) may work are (1) to walk according to the spirit ([link]v. 4[/link]); (2) to mind the things of the Spirit &amp;#8212; to set the mind on the spirit ([link]vv. 5-6[/link]); (3) to put to death by the Spirit the practices of the body ([link]v. 13[/link]); (4) to be led by the Spirit as sons of God ([link]v. 14[/link]); (5) to cry to the Father in the spirit of sonship ([link]v. 15[/link]); (6) to witness that we are the children of God ([link]v. 16[/link]); and (7) to groan for the full sonship, the redemption of our body ([link]v. 23[/link]).</note>
        <note num="3">It is difficult to discern the word [i]spirit[/i] used in this chapter, in [link]Gal. 5[/link], and in other places in the New Testament, unless it is clearly designated to denote God's Holy Spirit or our regenerated human spirit, as in [link book="Rom." chapter="8"]v. 9[/link] and [link]v. 16[/link] of this chapter. According to the usage in the New Testament, the word [i]spirit,[/i] as used in this verse, denotes our regenerated human spirit indwelt by and mingled with the Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God ([link]v. 9[/link]).

        <note num="1">Lit., the mind of the flesh. In [link]vv. 6-8[/link] the crucial item is the mind. The mind is the leading part of the soul, which is man's personality, his person. The mind thus represents the soul, that is, the person himself. In this chapter the mind is neutral, being between the regenerated mingled spirit and the fallen body, the flesh. [link]Chapters 7[/link] and [link book="Rom."]8[/link] show that the mind may have two different actions, by which it can cause us to be either in the spirit or in the flesh. If it relies on and attaches itself to the regenerated spirit, which is mingled with the Spirit of God, the mind will bring us into the spirit and into the enjoyment of the divine Spirit as the law of the Spirit of life ([link]v. 2[/link]). If the mind attaches itself to the flesh and acts independently, it will bring us into the flesh, causing us to be at enmity with God and to be unable to please Him ([link]vv. 7-8[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">Life and peace result from setting our mind on the spirit. When our mind is set on the spirit, our outward actions are in agreement with our inner man and there is no discrepancy between us and God. He and we are at peace, not at enmity ([link]v. 7[/link]). The result is that we feel peaceful within.[br][br]When our mind is set on the flesh and the things of the flesh, the result is death, which causes us to feel separated from the enjoyment of God. We feel uneasy and deadened instead of peaceful and living. When we are minding the flesh and setting our mind on the things of the flesh, the sense of death should serve as a warning to us, urging us to be delivered from the flesh and to live in the spirit.</note>
        <note num="3">Lit., the mind of the spirit. Setting the mind on the spirit is the same as minding the things of the Spirit in [link]v. 5[/link]. [link]Verse 6[/link] and [link]vv. 7-13[/link] show that Christ today is the life of God in the divine Spirit ([link]v. 2[/link]) and also the indwelling life of God in God's people, because God's Spirit of life has become the indwelling Spirit in us, the Spirit in both aspects being Christ.</note>

        <note num="1">This chapter unveils to us how the Triune God &amp;#8212; the Father ([link]v. 15[/link]), the Son ([link]vv. 3[/link], [link]29[/link], [link]32[/link]), and the Spirit ([link]vv. 9[/link], [link]11[/link], [link]13-14[/link], [link]16[/link], [link]23[/link], [link]26[/link]) &amp;#8212; dispenses Himself as life ([link]vv. 2[/link], [link]6[/link], [link]10[/link], [link]11[/link]) into us, the tripartite men &amp;#8212; spirit, soul, and body &amp;#8212; to make us His sons ([link]vv. 14-15[/link], [link]19[/link], [link]23[/link], [link]29[/link], [link]17[/link]) for the constituting of the Body of Christ ([link]12:4-5[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">I.e., makes home, resides (cf. [link]Eph. 3:17[/link]). If we allow the Spirit of the Triune God to make His home in us, that is, to settle Himself in us with adequate room, then in our experience we are in the spirit and are no longer in the flesh. If we are so, the Triune God as the Spirit will be able to spread from our spirit ([link]v. 10[/link]) into our soul, represented by our mind ([link]v. 6[/link]), and eventually He will even give life to our mortal body ([link]v. 11[/link]).</note>
        <note num="3">This shows that our being of Christ depends on His Spirit. If there were no Spirit of Christ, or if Christ were not the Spirit, there would be no way for us to be joined to Him and to belong to Him. However, Christ is the Spirit ([link]2 Cor. 3:17[/link]), and He is in our spirit ([link]2 Tim. 4:22[/link]) and is one spirit with us ([link]1 Cor. 6:17[/link]).</note>
        <note num="4">The Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ are not two Spirits but one. Paul used these titles interchangeably, indicating that the indwelling Spirit of life in [link]v. 2[/link] is the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit of the entire Triune God. God, the Spirit, and Christ &amp;#8212; the three of the Godhead &amp;#8212; are all mentioned in this verse. However, there are not three in us; there is only one, the triune Spirit of the Triune God ([link]John 4:24[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 3:17[/link]; [link]Rom. 8:11[/link]). [i]The Spirit of God[/i] implies that this Spirit is of the One who was from eternity past, who created the universe and is the origin of all things. [i]The Spirit of Christ[/i] implies that this Spirit is the embodiment and reality of Christ, the incarnated One. This Christ accomplished everything necessary to fulfill God's plan. He includes not only divinity, which He possessed from eternity, but also humanity, which He obtained through incarnation. He also includes human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. This is the Spirit of Christ in resurrection, that is, Christ Himself dwelling in our spirit ([link]v. 10[/link]) to impart Himself, the embodiment of the processed Triune God, into us as resurrection life and power to deal with the death that is in our nature ([link]v. 2[/link]). Thus, we may live today in Christ's resurrection, in Christ Himself, by living in the mingled spirit.</note>
        <note num="5">Referring to the unchangeable source and position rather than to the changeable condition and experience. We have the Spirit of Christ according to the source, the new birth; hence, we are of Christ and belong to Him.

        <note num="1">In this verse the Spirit is not mentioned, for here the emphasis is that Christ today is the Spirit and that the Spirit of Christ is the very Christ in us. According to the fact, it is Christ; according to experience, it is the Spirit. In our experience of Him, He is the Spirit; in our worshipping Him, calling on Him, and speaking of Him, He is Christ. We receive Him as our Savior and Redeemer, but He enters into us as the Spirit. As the Redeemer, He has the title [i]Christ;[/i] as the Indweller, He has the title [i]the Spirit.[/i] These are not two who dwell in us but one Dweller in two aspects.</note>
        <note num="2">"Christ...in you" is the crucial point of the book of Romans. In [link]ch. 3[/link] Christ is on the cross, shedding His blood for our redemption; in [link]ch. 4[/link] He is in resurrection; in [link]ch. 6[/link] we are in Him; now, in [link]ch. 8[/link] He is the Spirit in us.</note>
        <note num="3">Before we believed in the Lord, our spirit within was dead and our body without was alive. Now that we have Christ in us, though our body without is dead because of sin, our spirit within is life because of righteousness. Christ's coming into us as life exposes the death situation of our body. In our spirit is Christ the Spirit as righteousness, resulting in life; but in our flesh is Satan as sin, resulting in death.</note>
        <note num="4">Through the fall of man, sin, bringing death with it, entered the human body, causing it to become dead and impotent in the things of God. Although God condemned sin in the flesh ([link]v. 3[/link]), this sin has not been uprooted or eradicated from man's fallen body. Hence, our body is still dead.</note>
        <note num="5">The regenerated human spirit, in contrast to the fallen human body. This spirit is not the Spirit of God, for the spirit mentioned here is life only under the condition that Christ is in us. For the Spirit of God to be life, no particular condition is required. Hence, the spirit's being life because of righteousness can refer only to our human spirit, not to the Spirit of God.</note>
        <note num="6">Our spirit has not only been regenerated and made living; it has become life. When we believed in Christ, He as the divine Spirit of life came into our spirit and mingled Himself with it; the two spirits thereby have become one spirit ([link]1 Cor. 6:17[/link]). Now our spirit is not merely living but is life.</note>
        <note num="7">In God's justification we have received righteousness, which is the Triune God Himself entering into our being, into our spirit. This righteousness results in life ([link]5:18[/link], [link]21[/link]); hence, our spirit has now become life.</note>

[i]Sons[/i] here indicates a more advanced stage of growth in the divine life than does [i]children[/i] in [link]v. 16[/link], yet not as advanced as [i]heirs[/i] in [link]v. 17[/link]. [i]Children[/i] refers to the initial stage of sonship, the stage of regeneration in the human spirit. Sons are the children of God who are in the stage of the transformation of their souls. They not only have been regenerated in their spirit and are growing in the divine life, but they also are living and walking by being led by the Spirit. Heirs are the sons of God who, through the transfiguration of their body in the stage of glorification, will be fully matured in every part of their being. Hence, they will be qualified as the legal heirs to claim the divine inheritance ([link]vv. 17[/link], [link]23[/link]).</note>

The Spirit witnesses to our most basic and elementary relationship with God, namely, that we are His children; He does not witness that we are His sons or His heirs. Therefore, this witnessing of the Spirit begins from the time of our spiritual birth, our regeneration.</note>

        <note num="4">Christ was the only begotten Son of God from eternity ([link]John 1:18[/link]). When He was sent by God into the world, He was still the only begotten Son of God ([link]1 John 4:9[/link]; [link]John 1:14[/link]; [link]3:16[/link]). By His passing through death and entering into resurrection, His humanity was uplifted into His divinity. Thus, in His divinity with His humanity that passed through death and resurrection, He was born in resurrection as God's firstborn Son ([link]Acts 13:33[/link]). At the same time, all His believers were raised together with Him in His resurrection ([link]1 Pet. 1:3[/link]) and were begotten together with Him as the many sons of God. Thus they became His many brothers to constitute His Body and be God's corporate expression in Him.[br][br]As the only begotten Son of God, Christ had divinity but not humanity; He was self-existing and ever-existing, as God is. His being the firstborn Son of God, having both divinity and humanity, began with His resurrection. With His firstborn Son as the base, pattern, element, and means, God is producing many sons, and the many sons who are produced are the many believers who believe into God's firstborn Son and are joined to Him as one. They are exactly like Him in life and nature, and, like Him, they have both humanity and divinity. They are His increase and expression in order that they may express the eternal Triune God for eternity. The church today is a miniature of this expression ([link]Eph. 1:23[/link]), and the New Jerusalem in eternity will be the ultimate manifestation of this expression ([link]Rev. 21:11[/link]). This book reveals that God's making sinners His sons is for this expression ([link]12:5[/link]) and points to the ultimate manifestation of this expression ([link]Eph. 3:19[/link]).</note>
        <note num="5">The purpose of God's foreknowledge, predestination, and calling is to prepare and produce many brothers for His firstborn Son (see note [link]17[sup]2[/sup] in John 20[/link]) that, on the one hand, they, together with God's firstborn Son, may be the many sons of God with the divine life and nature for the expression of God, and that, on the other hand, they may be the many members who constitute the Body of God's firstborn Son as the corporate expression of God in His firstborn Son, which is the fullness of God's firstborn Son, that is, the fullness of God in His firstborn Son ([link]Eph. 1:23[/link]; [link]3:19[/link]).</note>

In this way He will transfigure our body, conforming it to the resurrected, glorious body of His Son ([link]Phil. 3:21[/link]).

The Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Old Testament, uses this word for [i]deep[/i] in [link]Gen. 1:2[/link]. Here, in this verse, it points to the place Christ visited after His death and before His resurrection, which place, according to [link]Acts 2:24[/link], [link]27[/link], is Hades; for [link]Acts 2:24[/link], [link]27[/link] reveals that Christ went into Hades after He died, and rose from that place in His resurrection. Hence, according to biblical usage, the word [i]abyss[/i] always refers to the region of death and of Satan's power of darkness, which is the lower parts of the earth ([link]Eph. 4:9[/link]), into which Christ descended after His death, which He conquered, and from which He ascended in His resurrection.</note>

Beginning with Enosh, the third generation of mankind, and continuing all the way down to the New Testament believers, God's chosen and redeemed ones enjoyed Christ's redemption and salvation and all His riches by means of this secret (see note [link]21[sup]1[/sup] in Acts 2[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">To be saved here means to be brought into the enjoyment of the riches of the Lord. The Lord is rich to both Jews and Greeks. All who call on the Lord's name enjoy this rich Lord; as a result, they are filled with Him and express Him.</note>

        <note num="1">After the parenthetical word that explains in detail God's selection, this book, continuing [link]ch. 8[/link], speaks concerning the latter half of God's complete salvation in Christ. In this latter half, those who enjoy the first half of God's complete salvation are members one of another as the Body of Christ ([link]v. 5[/link]). Furthermore, they have the living of the Body of Christ on the earth to express Christ in different localities (such as those enumerated in [link]ch. 16[/link]) that the Triune God may be expressed in such a living, as taught in the five chapters of the holy Word in this section, which concern the various aspects of this living. The first half of God's complete salvation, revealed in [link]chs. 1-8[/link], is the procedure by which God achieves His purpose; the second half of God's complete salvation, revealed in [link]chs. 12-16[/link], is the purpose of God's complete salvation.</note>
        <note num="2">Or, beg.</note>
        <note num="3">See note [link]15[sup]2[/sup] in ch. 9[/link]. In Greek the compassions referred to here are plural. God has had many kinds of compassion on us, as shown in His selecting us, calling us, saving us, and bringing us into His life that we may enjoy His riches and become His expression. Through these many compassions as the means and the motivating power, the apostle exhorted us to present our bodies to God for the fulfillment of His purpose.</note>
        <note num="4">For the church life, the life of the Body of Christ, to be realized, our entire being is needed. Thus, this chapter speaks concerning our body ([link]v. 1[/link]), our soul ([link]v. 2[/link]), and our spirit ([link]v. 11[/link]). Our body must be presented to God for the Body of Christ.</note>
        <note num="5">In [link]ch. 6[/link] the members of our body are to be presented as weapons of righteousness ([link]6:13[/link]) for warfare and service. In this chapter, however, our bodies are to be presented as a living sacrifice for the church life. This sacrifice is living because it has life through resurrection; it is not like the sacrifices in the Old Testament, which were all slain. This sacrifice is also holy because, positionally, it has been separated unto God by the blood of Christ from the world and from all persons, matters, and things that are common; and because, dispositionally, the natural life and the old creation have been sanctified and transformed by the Holy Spirit with God's life and God's holy nature for God's satisfaction. Thus, this sacrifice is well pleasing to God.[br][br]In Greek, [i]bodies[/i] here is plural and [i]sacrifice[/i] is singular. This indicates that, although many bodies are presented, they become one sacrifice, implying that, although we are many, our service in the Body of Christ should not be many individual services, separated and unrelated. All our service should constitute one whole service, and this service must be unique because it is the service of the one Body of Christ.</note>
        <note num="6">Or, intelligent, logical, rational, in harmony with the highest reason.</note>
        <note num="7">Service in worship of God. See note [link]9[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 1[/link]. Before this chapter such a service is not mentioned with reference to believers other than the apostle. This indicates that the service of the believers is an issue of the growth in life described in the foregoing chapters. It indicates further that this service must be in the Body, the church. This corresponds with the types in Exodus and Leviticus, which show that the service of the priesthood rendered to God was not established until after the Tent of Meeting was built.</note>

        <note num="1">This means that we should not be assimilated by the world to the extent that we who have been separated from the world unto God have the same image as this age, not caring for the transformation of the Lord Spirit in us with God's essence to conform us to the Lord's glorious image ([link]2 Cor. 3:18[/link]), which the Spirit carries out by moving and working in us through the divine life and the divine nature.</note>
        <note num="2">[i]This age[/i] denotes the present, practical part of the world (see note [link]4[sup]2[/sup] in Gal. 1[/link]), that part which we contact and in which we live; whereas the world, the evil system of Satan (see note [link]2[sup]1[/sup] in Eph. 2[/link]), is the composition of all people, matters, and things outside of God, including religious as well as secular things, as in [link]Gal. 6:14[/link], where the world mentioned is the religious world of Paul's time. This satanic world is composed of many different ages, each having its own particular pattern, characteristics, fashions, styles, and trends. We cannot forsake the world without forsaking the present age that appears before us.</note>
        <note num="3">Transformation is the inward, metabolic process in which God works to spread His divine life and nature throughout every part of our being, particularly our soul, bringing Christ and His riches into our being as our new element and causing our old, natural element to be gradually discharged. As a result, we will be transformed into His image ([link]2 Cor. 3:18[/link]), that is, conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God as His many brothers ([link]8:29[/link]). Thus we will be suitable for the building up of His Body.</note>
        <note num="4">After presenting our body, we need to have our mind renewed. The renewing of the mind, which results from setting the mind on the spirit ([link]8:6[/link]), is the base for the transformation of our soul. Our mind is the leading part of our soul, and as it is renewed, our will and emotion automatically follow to be renewed also. To be renewed means that a new element is wrought into our being. This produces an inward metabolic transformation, making us suitable for the building up of the Body of Christ, which is the practice of the church life. All the virtues and the overcoming in [link]chs. 12-16[/link] also are the results of this transformation.</note>
        <note num="5">I.e., see and discern. Based on the presenting of our bodies and the renewing of our minds, we will see, discern, and prove by testing that the will of God is to obtain a Body for Christ to be His fullness and expression.</note>
        <note num="6">In this chapter the will of God is that we whom God has chosen, called, redeemed, justified, sanctified, and conformed unto glorification in the preceding eleven chapters may be members one of another to have the living of the Body of Christ ([link]vv. 3-5[/link]). The Body of Christ is the peak of God's divine revelation. The living of the Body is the issue and goal of the presenting of our bodies, the renewing of our mind, and all the life practices in the foregoing chapters.</note>

        <note num="1">The gifts are received according to the grace given to us and are a result of our experience of the grace of Christ. This grace is God in Christ as the divine element coming into our being to be our life for our enjoyment. When this grace comes into us, it brings with it the element of certain spiritual skills and abilities, which, accompanying our growth in life, develop into the gifts in life that we may function in the Body of Christ to serve God. The gifts in life here are different from the gifts mentioned in [link]Eph. 4:8[/link], which refer to the gifted persons given by Christ in His ascension to His Body for its building up. The gifts in life here are also different from the miraculous gifts mentioned in [link]1 Cor. 12[/link] and [link book="1 Cor."]14[/link]. The gifts in life are developed by the growth in life and by the transformation in life mentioned in [link]v. 2[/link], out of the inward, initial gifts mentioned in [link]1 Cor. 1:7[/link].</note>
        <note num="2">To prophesy is to speak for God and to speak forth God under His direct revelation. Prediction may be included in prophecy, but it is not the main aspect of the prophecy mentioned here. Prophesying brings in God's revelation for the building up of the church, the Body of Christ ([link]1 Cor. 14:4b[/link]). These three &amp;#8212; prophecy, teaching ([link]v. 7[/link]), and exhortation ([link]v. 8[/link]) &amp;#8212; are related and coordinate with one another. The one who prophesies speaks what he has received as a direct revelation from God. The one who teaches instructs others, not based on direct revelation but based on what the prophets have spoken. He who exhorts does so according to both the direct speaking under God's revelation and the teaching that is according to this revelation. These three kinds of speaking are for the building up of the Body. They minister the life supply to the saints that they may grow together by God's word.</note>

Putting on Christ is the same as putting on the weapons of light ([link]v. 12[/link]), indicating that Christ is the weapons of light for the warfare between the Spirit and the lusts. The warfare here is the same as the conflict between the Spirit and the lusts of the flesh ([link]Gal. 5:17[/link]).

        <note num="1">This chapter can be considered a supplement to the constitution of the church life. In setting forth every article, the author's heart was tolerant, his attitude was broad, and his view was noble. In order to practice the church life that he instituted in [link]ch. 12[/link], we must strictly observe the supplement set forth in this chapter. Many saints who love the Lord and seek to live the church life have failed because they were either negligent or mistaken in this matter.</note>
        <note num="2">To practice the Body life revealed in [link]ch. 12[/link], we must learn the practical lessons of receiving the believers, as revealed particularly in [link]14:1-15:13[/link], that the church life may be all-inclusive, able to include all kinds of genuine Christians. Such receiving requires the transformation mentioned in [link]ch. 12[/link]; if we remain natural, we will be unable to receive those whose views are different from ours in doctrine or in practice.</note>
        <note num="3">I.e., doctrinal considerations. Except in the matters of idol worship ([link]1 John 5:21[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 8:4-7[/link]), fornication, rapaciousness, reviling, and other such gross sins ([link]1 Cor. 5:9-11[/link]; [link]6:9-10[/link]), division ([link]16:17[/link]; [link]Titus 3:10[/link]), and the denial of the incarnation of Christ ([link]2 John 7-11[/link]), we must learn not to pass judgments on the doctrinal views of others. As long as one is a genuine Christian and has the fundamental faith of the New Testament, we should not exclude him, even though he may differ from us with respect to doctrine; rather, we should receive him in the same one Lord.</note>

        <note num="1">Concerning the receiving of the believers, Paul used eating ([link]vv. 2-3[/link]) and the keeping of days ([link]vv. 5-6[/link]) as examples. God's receiving has nothing to do with what we eat or with our keeping of certain days. These are minor, secondary matters that have nothing to do with our salvation and basic faith. Therefore, we should not despise or judge others in these things.</note>
        <note num="2">The basis on which we receive the believers is that God has received them. God receives people according to His Son. When a person receives God's Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, as his Savior, God receives that person immediately and ushers him into the enjoyment of the Triune God and of all He has prepared and accomplished in Christ for us. We should receive people in the same way and should not be more narrow than God. Regardless of how much they differ from us in doctrinal concepts or religious practices, we must receive them. When we receive people according to God and not according to doctrine or practice, we demonstrate and maintain the oneness of the Body of Christ.</note>

The eternal judgment at the great white throne will be (1) after the millennium, (2) to judge all the dead unbelievers, and (3) for eternal punishment in the lake of fire. Since this judgment will be executed upon all the condemned sinners, it is mentioned in this book in the section on condemnation. However, the judgment at the judgment seat of God, or the judgment seat of Christ, will be (1) before the millennium, immediately after Christ's coming back, (2) to judge all the resurrected and raptured believers, and (3) for reward or punishment in the millennial kingdom. This judgment will take account of the believers' life and work after they were saved. Since this judgment is very much related to the transformation of the believers, it is mentioned here in this section on transformation.</note>

        <note num="1">This verse is a strong proof that the church in the church age is the kingdom of God, because the context here deals with the church life in the present age. The church is a matter of grace and life, whereas the kingdom is a matter of exercise and discipline.</note>
        <note num="2">The kingdom of God is the sphere in which God exercises His authority so that He may express His glory for the fulfillment of His purpose. In such a kingdom, what matters is not eating and drinking but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. Righteousness denotes that which is right and proper. Those who live in the kingdom of God should be right and proper toward others, toward things, and toward God; with them there should be nothing erroneous, improper, crooked, slanted, or biased. This requires that they be strict in dealing with themselves. Peace is the fruit of righteousness ([link]Heb. 12:11[/link] and note). It characterizes the relationship that those who live in the kingdom of God should have with others and with God. If we are righteous, right, and proper toward others, toward things, and toward God, we will have a peaceful relationship with others and with God. Thus, we will have joy in the Holy Spirit and, in particular, before God. In this way we will be filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit ([link]Acts 13:52[/link]) and will live out righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit, which are the reality of the kingdom of God.[br][br]According to the context of this chapter, this verse was written for our receiving of the believers. If we receive the believers according to the apostle's instruction in this chapter, we will be right and proper toward those whom we receive and will have peace with them; thus, we will have joy in the Holy Spirit, proving that we are living in the reality of God's kingdom and are under God's rule. Otherwise, we will not be right or proper toward those whom we do not receive and will not have peace with them; thus, we will not have joy in the Holy Spirit before God, proving that we are not subject to God's authority in the kingdom of God.</note>

        <note num="1">The Greek word means [i]with the same mind, will, and purpose.[/i] This is to be one in our whole being and results in our being one in our outward speaking. Whenever we are in one accord, we speak the same thing; we speak with one mouth. This oneness is the reverse of Babel, where the division among mankind caused their language to become confused and divided into many different speakings ([link]Gen. 11:7[/link], [link]9[/link]). The only way to be with one accord and one mouth is to allow Christ the room to be everything in our heart and in our mouth that God may be glorified.</note>

        <note num="3">Paul's being a priest of the gospel of God to minister Christ to the Gentiles was a priestly service to God, and the Gentiles whom he gained through his gospel preaching were an offering presented to God. By this priestly service many Gentiles, who were unclean and defiled, were sanctified in the Holy Spirit and became such an offering, acceptable to God. They were set apart from things common and were saturated with God's nature and element, and were thus sanctified both positionally and dispositionally (see note [link]19[sup]2[/sup] in ch. 6[/link]). Such a sanctification is in the Holy Spirit. This means that, based on Christ's redemption, the Holy Spirit renews, transforms, and separates unto holiness those who have been regenerated by believing into Christ.</note>

All have been made available, and most of these have been applied to the producing and building up of the church for the fulfillment of God's purpose according to His will ([link]12:2[/link]).[br][br]Four stations are revealed in this book: the matters covered in [link]chs. 1-4[/link] bring us in [link]ch. 4[/link] to the first station, the station of justification; [link]chs. 5-8[/link] lead us in [link]ch. 8[/link] to the second station, the station of sanctification; [link]chs. 9-12[/link] lead us in [link]ch. 12[/link] to the third station, the station of the Body of Christ; and [link]chs. 13-16[/link] take us in [link]ch. 16[/link] to the fourth station, the station of the churches expressed in different localities, the station of the practical living of the Body of Christ in different localities. The churches are the ultimate consummation of the complete salvation of the gospel of God revealed in this book, which was written not in the way of doctrine but in the way of practicality. In the first station we are regenerated and saved, in the second station we are sanctified, in the third station we are renewed and transformed, and in the fourth station, in the practical church life, Satan is crushed under our feet and we are able to fully enjoy the Lord's grace and God's peace ([link]v. 20[/link]).</note>

In its conclusion this book, which gives a general discussion concerning the Christian life and the church life, gives glory to the wise God. This unveils that all the matters discussed in this book, such as how God selects us, how He saves us from sin and death, how He redeems us and justifies us, how He makes us, sinners who were dead through and through, His divine sons, how He transfers us out of Adam into Christ, how He sanctifies and transforms us in Christ, how He makes us the members of Christ for the constituting of the Body of Christ, and how He causes us to be the local churches appearing in different localities as the expressions of the Body of Christ on the earth in this age &amp;#8212; all these matters are planned, managed, and accomplished by God's wisdom, in order that He, the unlimitedly rich Triune God, may be glorified, that is, that His incomparable glory may be completely and fully expressed through us who have been perfected eternally by Him and who have become His Body and have been joined to Him as one. The focus of God's wisdom is the working of His Divine Trinity into the three parts &amp;#8212; spirit, soul, and body &amp;#8212; of our redeemed being that in His redemption, sanctification, and transformation we may have a full union in the divine life with Him, that His desire for the mingling of divinity and humanity, the joining of humanity to divinity, may be fulfilled for eternity. This truly is worthy of our appreciation and worship! How blessed and how glorious it is that we can participate in this! This is worthy of our unceasing singing and praise for eternity! Both our Christian life and our church life should have this as our center and goal. May God bless in this way everyone who has been chosen and perfected by Him.[br][br]Through God's divine dispensing in us and His divine union with us, we can experience and enjoy the saving in Christ's life in God's full salvation (see note [link]10[sup]2[/sup] in ch. 5[/link]), as conveyed to us in this book, in the following aspects:[br][br](1) By the abundance of grace (God Himself) and of the gift of righteousness (Christ Himself) which we received, we are able to reign in Christ's divine life ([link]5:17[/link]) over sin, death, the old man, the flesh, Satan, the world, and all persons, matters, and things that do not submit to God.[br][br](2) God's holy nature sanctifies our worldly disposition ([link]6:19[/link], [link]22[/link]; [link]15:16[/link]). God sanctifies us dispositionally out of His divine life and unto His divine life that we may enjoy more of His divine life.[br][br](3) The indwelling law of the Spirit of life, that is, the automatic and spontaneous working of the Triune God as life in us, frees us from the law of sin and of death, the slavery and bondage of sin ([link]8:2[/link], [link]11[/link]). The operation of this law comes out of God's divine life, and it also causes the increase of the divine life in us.[br][br](4) The Divine Trinity's divine dispensing in our spirit, soul, and body causes these three parts to be saturated with the processed divine life ([link]8:5-11[/link]), with the result that our entire being is completely united with the processed Triune God and mingled with Him as one.[br][br](5) The renewing of our mind by the Spirit results in the transformation of our soul, which saves us from being conformed to the modern style of the world ([link]12:2[/link]) and issues in all the virtues and the overcoming, mentioned in [link]chs. 12-16[/link], as our daily life, a life of the highest standard, and as our church life, a life that is all-overcoming.[br][br](6) By the renewing of our mind and the transformation of our soul, we become members one of another with all believers in the Body of Christ and are built up together as the Body of Christ and thereby have the service of the Body ([link]12:1[/link], [link]3-8[/link]). This is the crystallization of our experience of the saving in Christ's life.[br][br](7) Based on the revelation and teaching in [link]chs. 14-16[/link] of this book, we live the life of the local church in different localities as the appearance of the Body of Christ, the universal church, in different localities.[br][br](8) By becoming the built-up church, a church against which the gates of Hades cannot prevail, in different localities, we afford God the opportunity to crush Satan under our feet that we may enjoy Christ as our rich grace and the God of peace as our surpassing peace ([link]16:20[/link]).[br][br](9) In our experience of the various aspects of the saving in the divine life, as mentioned above, we are being conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God ([link]8:28-29[/link]) through the "all things" arranged under God's sovereignty, so that we have His divine attributes and His human virtues and thereby express the glory and beauty of Him, the God-man.[br][br](10) In the process of our experience of the saving in the divine life, the splendor of the divine life gradually saturates us until it saturates our body, issuing in the redemption of our body ([link]8:23[/link]), that our spirit, soul, and body may all enter into the glory of God ([link]8:30[/link], [link]17[/link]). This glorification is the peak attained in us by the saving in the divine life, and it is the climax of God's full salvation.</note>
