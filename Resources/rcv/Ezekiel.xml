        <verse num="1">
        <text>Now in the [note]1[/note]thirtieth year, in the fourth [i]month,[/i] on the fifth of the month, while I was among the captives by the [note]2[/note]river Chebar, the [note]3[/note]heavens were [xref]a[/xref]opened and I saw [note]4[/note][xref]b[/xref]visions of God.</text>
        <note num="1">Referring to Ezekiel's age. At the age of thirty a priest, a Levite, was qualified to begin his service to the Lord ([link]Num. 4:2-3[/link]; [link]1 Chron. 23:3[/link]; cf. [link]Luke 3:23[/link]). This age signifies maturity, indicating that in spiritual things, especially in seeing the visions recorded in this book, there is the need of maturity in the divine life (cf. [link]1 Cor. 2:14-15[/link]; [link]3:1-2[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">A river in Babylon that flows east of the Euphrates and eventually empties into it. [i]Chebar[/i] means [i]strong, powerful.[/i] The river Chebar symbolizes the power of Babylon to damage God's people (cf. [link]Isa. 8:7-8[/link]). It signifies the tide of the present age, which carries people away from God to Babylon. There are two rivers in the book of Ezekiel: the river Chebar in [link]ch. 1[/link] and the river flowing out of the temple in [link]ch. 47[/link]. The former carries the people of God away from God and destroys the building of God; the latter brings people into God's life and builds up God's dwelling place (cf. note [link]12[sup]1[/sup] in Gen. 2[/link]).</note>
        <note num="3">The opening of the heavens is God's special visitation (cf. [link]Gen. 28:11-17[/link]; [link]Matt. 3:16-17[/link]; [link]Acts 7:56[/link]). The people of Israel had been damaged by Satan and carried away into captivity; as a result, the heavens could not be opened to them. However, among those in captivity there was a priest, Ezekiel ([link]v. 3[/link]), who was seeking God and contacting Him and who was connected to the heavens. The heavens could therefore be opened to him and could even come down to the earth, enabling God's heavenly things to be seen by people on earth and to be fulfilled among them on earth.</note>
        <note num="4">God's visions are His revelations, which enable His people to see divine, spiritual, heavenly things. Ezekiel saw spiritual, heavenly visions in his spirit (cf. [link]Eph. 3:3-5[/link]; [link]Rev. 1:10[/link]; [link]4:2[/link]; [link]17:3[/link]; [link]21:10[/link]) under an opened heaven, and he presented these visions to God's people that they might be recovered from their captivity for the building up of God's dwelling place. It was mainly through Ezekiel's prophesying to the people in captivity ([link]3:10-11[/link]) that they eventually detested the idols, turned their hearts to God, and were returned to their homeland after seventy years.[br][br]The Bible as a whole, and the book of Ezekiel as a miniature of the Bible, reveal that God's eternal intention is to dispense Himself into His chosen people, making them the same as He is in His life, His nature, and His image but not in His Godhead, that they might be mingled with Him as one entity and be built together in Him to be His eternal habitation, the New Jerusalem. This is the central point of the revelation of the Bible and also of the four visions presented in the book of Ezekiel.</note>

        <verse num="2">
        <text>On the fifth of the month (it was the [note]1[/note]fifth year of King [xref]a[/xref]Jehoiachin's captivity)</text>
        <note num="1">Whereas the thirtieth year ([link]v. 1[/link]) was counted from the year of Ezekiel's birth, the fifth year here was counted from the year of Jehoiachin's captivity ([link]2 Kings 24:8-16[/link]). Ezekiel also was taken captive at that time. From this verse to the end of the book the years are counted from the year of captivity. Five years after he was captured, Ezekiel began to see the visions in this chapter. In the following years he continued to see visions concerning a later capture of Jerusalem, which took place in the eleventh year of the reign of Zedekiah, who replaced Jehoiachin as king of Judah ([link]2 Kings 24:17-25:21[/link]). While Ezekiel was in captivity he was brought back in the Spirit to Jerusalem to see the coming events. Before Nebuchadnezzar came to Jerusalem, burned the city, destroyed the temple, and captured Zedekiah, Ezekiel saw these events in his visions.</note>

        </verse>
        <verse num="3">
        <text>The [note]1[/note]word of Jehovah came expressly to [note]2[/note]Ezekiel the [note]3[/note]priest, the son of [note]2[/note]Buzi, in the land of the [note]4[/note]Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the [note]5[/note][xref]a[/xref]hand of Jehovah was upon him there.</text>
        <note num="1">God wanted Ezekiel not only to behold with his eyes but also to hear with his ears ([link]40:4[/link]); hence, He gave him His words along with His visions. God's word to Ezekiel was not an ordinary word but an express word, a special word. God's express words enable us both to understand the visions and to proclaim and explain what we have seen ([link]1 Cor. 2:9-13[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">[i]Ezekiel[/i] means [i]God strengthens,[/i] or [i]may God strengthen,[/i] and [i]Buzi[/i] means [i]contemptible,[/i] or [i]despised.[/i] As the son of Buzi, Ezekiel was a prophet despised by the people and treated with contempt, but he was strengthened by God, the Mighty One (Heb. El). As a son of shame, a son of abasement, Ezekiel was appointed by God to be a sign to the people of Israel, a sign of their being put to shame ([link]12:6[/link], [link]11[/link]; [link]24:24[/link], [link]27[/link]). As a man strengthened and empowered by God, Ezekiel could bear the shame and the disgrace in order to fulfill his ministry as a prophet of God, God's oracle.</note>
        <note num="3">As a priest Ezekiel was one who lived in the presence of God, serving God and being mingled with God. He was in the land of captivity by the river Chebar, not in the holy temple, yet he looked to God, prayed to God, contacted God, fellowshipped with God, and waited for God. Because Ezekiel was such a person, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw visions of God ([link]v. 1[/link]).</note>
        <note num="4">Chaldea was the place where Babel began ([link]Gen. 11:1-9[/link]). The name [i]Babel[/i] in Hebrew is the equivalent of [i]Babylon[/i] in Greek. Thus, Chaldea was actually Babylon ([link]12:13[/link]), the place where Satan instigated the greatest rebellion against God among the fallen people. It was also the place out of which God called Abraham that He might have a chosen people ([link]Acts 7:2-4[/link]). At Ezekiel's time many of God's chosen people had been carried back to that place.</note>
        <note num="5">The hand of the Lord follows the word of the Lord. If what one ministers is truly God's word, God's almighty hand will follow to accomplish what he speaks. God's hand upon man is also for leading man and for causing one to take action (cf. [link]1 Kings 18:46[/link]). After the Lord's hand came upon Ezekiel, he did not act according to his own choice but according to the leading and directing of the Lord's hand.</note>

        <verse num="4">
        <text>And I looked, and there came a [xref]a[/xref]storm [note]1[/note]wind from the [note]2[/note][xref]b[/xref]north, a great [note]3[/note][xref]c[/xref]cloud and a [note]4[/note]fire flashing incessantly; and there was a brightness around it, and from the midst of it there was [i]something[/i] like the sight of [note]5[/note][xref]d[/xref]electrum, from the midst of the fire.</text>
        <note num="1">As with the entire Bible, the book of Ezekiel uses visible, physical things to signify spiritual things. The storm wind here is a figure of the powerful Spirit of God ([link]Acts 2:2[/link], [link]4a[/link]). In the Scriptures the wind has both a negative and positive significance. In its negative significance the wind is a symbol, or sign, of God's judgment upon man ([link]Jer. 49:26[/link]; [link]Rev. 7:1[/link]). In its positive significance the wind symbolizes the blowing of the Holy Spirit upon man or the descending of the Holy Spirit upon man to cause man to have God's life ([link]37:9-10[/link]; [link]John 3:6-8[/link]; [link]Acts 2:2-21[/link]). The storm wind here has this positive significance.</note>
        <note num="2">From the north means from God ([link]Psa. 75:6-7a[/link]; [link]Isa. 14:13[/link]). Whenever God visits us and revives us, His Spirit blows on us like a mighty wind to bring a spiritual storm into our life, into our work, and into our church, causing us to be dissatisfied and concerned about our spiritual condition and to have a turn in our spiritual life.</note>
        <note num="3">The cloud here is a figure of God as the Spirit abiding with His people and covering them in order to care for them and show favor to them ([link]Exo. 13:21[/link]; [link]40:34-35[/link]; [link]Prov. 16:15[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 10:1-2[/link]). God comes to us as the wind, but He stays with us as the cloud. Together, the wind and the cloud are an indication that an important transaction is about to take place between God and man.</note>
        <note num="4">The fire seen by Ezekiel signifies God's burning and sanctifying power ([link]Deut. 4:24[/link]; [link]Heb. 12:29[/link]). Whenever God visits us, His holy fire comes to consume in us everything that does not match His holy nature and disposition. This burning fire also causes us to be enlightened concerning our spiritual condition before God. The more the fire of the Holy Spirit burns in us, the more we are purified and enlightened (cf. [link]Isa. 6:5-7[/link]; [link]1 John 1:7[/link]).</note>
        <note num="5">Following the rendering of the Septuagint and the Vulgate; others translate, glowing metal. "An unknown substance; some think a mixture of gold and silver" (Darby). Gold signifies the nature of God, and silver signifies redemption. The electrum, composed of the elements of gold and silver, signifies the Lamb-God, the redeeming God (see note [link]1[sup]5[/sup] in Rev. 22[/link]). That the glowing electrum appeared from the midst of the fire indicates that the burning of the divine fire is for the manifestation of the electrum.[br][br]The spiritual history of a normal Christian should be a continual cycle involving the experience of God as the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum. The more we experience the wind, the cloud, and the fire, the more the electrum is constituted into our being, making us a people who are filled with the Triune God and who manifest His glory. The issue of the spiritual transactions involving the blowing wind, the covering cloud, and the purifying fire is the glowing electrum &amp;#8212; the radiant expression of the redeeming God. Cf. note [link]7[sup]3[/sup] in 1 John 1[/link].</note>

        <note num="1">[i]And[/i] at the beginning of the verse indicates that in addition to the electrum, the four living creatures came out from the midst of the fire. The more we experience God as the blowing wind, the overshadowing cloud, the burning fire, and the glowing electrum, the more we are enlivened with the divine life to become the four living creatures. The number four is related to God's creation ([link]Isa. 11:12[/link]; [link]Jer. 49:36[/link]; [link]Rev. 7:1[/link]) and signifies man as God's creature.</note>
        <note num="2">The four living creatures are reckoned not as individuals but as a group, as one entity. As such, they are the corporate expression of the man on the throne ([link]v. 26[/link]). That the four living creatures bear the likeness of a man and that God on the throne also bears the appearance of a man indicates that God's central thought and His arrangement are related to man ([link]Gen. 1:26[/link]; [link]Psa. 8:4-8[/link]). According to the vision unveiled in this chapter, man is the means for God to manifest His glory, man is the means for God to move on the earth, and man is the means for God to administrate on the throne. God uses the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum to enliven us in order to gain man as the means of His manifestation, move, and administration.</note>

A calf's foot is also cloven, divided, signifying that in their walk the living creatures can discern what is right and what is wrong and what is clean and what is unclean in the eyes of God ([link]Phil. 1:9-10[/link]; cf. note [link]3[sup]1[/sup] in Lev. 11[/link]). That the feet of the living creatures sparkled like the sight of burnished bronze signifies that their walk has been tested and examined by the Lord and that it shines, giving light to others and being a test to their walk (cf. note [link]15[sup]1[/sup] in Rev. 1[/link]).[br][br]A calf signifies freshness, livingness, and vigor (cf. [link]Psa. 29:6[/link]; [link]Mal. 4:2[/link]). The walk of the living creatures is vigorous, full of life, freshness, and newness, like a young calf (cf.

This is to be balanced. That the human hands are under eagle's wings indicates that in doing everything we should be under God's grace and under His covering, depending on the Lord and expressing Him.</note>

        <note num="1">Each living creature had four faces ([link]v. 6[/link]). The face of a man indicates that the living creatures live in a proper humanity, the humanity of Jesus. The face of a lion indicates that in relation to sin, the world, and Satan they are bold, strong, victorious, and reigning ([link]Rev. 5:5[/link]; [link]Rom. 5:17[/link]). The face of an ox indicates that they are willing to bear the burden, to labor, and even to sacrifice themselves ([link]1 Cor. 15:10[/link], [link]58[/link]; [link]Acts 20:24[/link]; [link]Phil. 2:30[/link]). The face of an eagle indicates that the living creatures are transcendent, buoyant, and powerful in the life of God ([link]John 6:15[/link]; [link]Phil. 4:12-13[/link]).[br][br]The four living creatures with their four faces signify a coordinated, corporate entity, the corporate Christ ([link]1 Cor. 12:12[/link] and note 2) as the corporate expression of God among human beings. The four faces of the living creatures portray the life of Christ as depicted in the four Gospels: Matthew shows Christ as a lion, the King of God's kingdom; Mark portrays Him as an ox, the Servant of God; Luke depicts Him as a man, the Man-Savior; and John shows Him as an eagle, the very God (see note [link]1[sup]1[/sup], par. 3, in Matt. 1[/link]). Thus, the four living creatures are a corporate expression of Christ, living out the life of Christ in a corporate way.</note>

        <note num="2">[link]Verses 11b-14[/link] convey a clear picture of the coordination of the living creatures, a portrait of the proper church life. The joining of two wings of the living creatures is for their corporate moving in coordination. The eagle's wings are the means by which they are coordinated and move as one. This signifies that their coordination is not in themselves but in God and by the divine power, the divine strength, and the divine grace. This is similar to the boards of the tabernacle being joined into one building by the overlaying gold and the gold rings ([link]Exo. 26:26-29[/link] and notes).</note>
        <note num="3">The wings of an eagle are not only for moving but also for protection. Whatever we do and whatever we are must be by the grace of the Lord and the power of the Lord ([link]1 Cor. 15:10[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 1:12[/link]; [link]4:7[/link]). At the same time, we are under the overshadowing, the covering, of the Lord's grace and the Lord's power ([link]Psa. 17:8[/link]; [link]57:1[/link]; [link]63:7[/link]; [link]91:4[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 12:9b[/link]).[br][br]The living creatures look like a man ([link]v. 5[/link]), but they move like an eagle. This indicates that we must always express ourselves like a normal man; but the moving and overshadowing wings should give others an impression of the Divine Being, an impression that we have God with us as our power and protection.</note>

        <note num="1">Lit., in the direction of their faces. The move of the living creatures is not individual but corporate. They move as one entity in coordination. Each of the living creatures faces one direction. As they face these four directions, two of their wings spread out and touch the adjacent creatures' wings, forming a square. When the living creatures move, they do not need to turn; one moves straight forward while the opposite creature moves backward and the other two move sideways ([link]v. 9[/link]). This is a beautiful picture of the coordination in the church as the Body of Christ, in which each member has his particular position and function, or ministry ([link]Rom. 12:4-8[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 12:14-30[/link]; [link]Eph. 4:7-16[/link]). When one member functions, he moves "straight forward" to fulfill his function, and the other members accommodate him by moving in the same direction, some moving "backward" and others moving "sideways."[br][br]According to the vision of the four living creatures, the coordination of the believers as members of the Body of Christ results in the corporate expression of God in Christ, in the move of God on the earth, and in the administration of God on the throne, thus affording God a way to manifest His glory and accomplish His eternal purpose and plan. In order to participate in such a coordination, we need to have the spiritual experiences and the practical living symbolized by the details in [link]vv. 4-12[/link].</note>

In the book of Ezekiel God's economy and God's move in His economy are signified by a wheel. The hub of this great wheel signifies Christ as the center of God's economy, and the rim signifies Christ's counterpart, the church, which consummates in the New Jerusalem. The spokes of the wheel spreading from the hub to the rim signify the many believers as the members of Christ.[br][br]The appearing of the wheels on the earth beside the living creatures indicates that God's move on earth follows the coordination of the four living creatures. The move by a wheel implies an extraordinary move with a purpose. Furthermore, it implies that this move is not by our own strength.</note>

        <note num="1">The four living creatures are not only for the manifestation of the Lord and not only for the move of the Lord but also for the administration, the government, of the Lord. The Lord is among them and above them for His manifestation, move, and government. In such a situation God is not only the God of heaven but also the God of the earth (see note [link]25[sup]3[/sup] in Matt. 11[/link]). Through the living creatures the heavens are open to the earth and are joined to the earth.[br][br]The Lord's presence is always with His throne. The Lord's throne is both in the third heaven and in our spirit ([link]Rev. 4:2-3[/link]; [link]Heb. 4:16[/link] and note 1; cf. [link]2 Tim. 4:22[/link]). The throne above the crystal clear expanse indicates that whenever we have a "clear sky" in our Christian life and in our church life, we will be under the ruling of the throne. The highest point in our spiritual experience is having a clear sky with a throne above it. To reach this point means that in everything we allow God to have the preeminence and are completely submissive to God's authority and administration. The throne is not only for God to reign over us but also for God to accomplish His eternal purpose. If we have the throne in our spiritual life, God will not only rule over us but will also fulfill His purpose in us, with us, and through us.</note>
        <note num="2">A sapphire stone, blue in color, signifies a heavenly condition that exists when God is present in a particular situation ([link]Exo. 24:10[/link]). The throne being in the likeness of a sapphire stone shows the presence of God in a heavenly situation.</note>
        <note num="3">The One on the throne looks like a man, yet with Him there is the appearance of the glory of Jehovah ([link]v. 28[/link]), indicating that the One sitting on the throne is both God and man. This is Jesus Christ, the God-man, the mingling of God and man. He was the complete God, and He was incarnated to be a man ([link]John 1:1[/link], [link]14[/link]). Having the nature of man, He lived, died, resurrected, and ascended as a man, and now as the One on the throne, He is still the Son of Man ([link]John 6:62[/link]; [link]Acts 7:56[/link]). Hence, since the ascension of the Lord Jesus there has been a man on the throne. In the millennium and in the new heaven and new earth for eternity, there will still be a man on the throne ([link]Matt. 19:28[/link]; [link]Rev. 22:1[/link], [link]3[/link]).[br][br]As revealed in the Bible, God's mysterious intention in His relationship with man is to mingle Himself with man and thereby to become the same as man and make man the same as God in life, in nature, and in expression but not in the Godhead. Man was created in the image of God to express God and to rule for God ([link]Gen. 1:26-28[/link] and notes). The One on the throne and the four living creatures both have the appearance of a man, indicating that the four living creatures on earth are the expression of the One on the throne (see note [link]5[sup]2[/sup][/link]). This expression is the manifestation of God in humanity ([link]1 Tim. 3:15-16[/link]). God in heaven desires to gain man on earth for His expression by working Himself into man. Furthermore, God's intention is to work on man in order that man will be on the throne. As the Pioneer, the Forerunner, the Lord Jesus cut the way to enter into glory and sit on the throne ([link]Heb. 2:6-9[/link]), and we, His many brothers, are now following Him ([link]Heb. 2:10-12[/link]; [link]Rev. 3:21[/link]; [link]22:5[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">A rainbow as the brightness around the man who is sitting on the throne signifies the splendor and glory around the Lord on the throne. At Noah's time the rainbow in the cloud was a sign of God's faithfulness in keeping His covenant with man and every living creature that He would never again destroy mankind with a flood (see note [link]13[sup]1[/sup] in Gen. 9[/link]).[br][br]A rainbow can be considered as being produced from the combining of three basic colors &amp;#8212; red, yellow, and blue. Red, the color of fire, refers to God's holiness; yellow, the color of electrum, signifies God's glory; and blue, the color of the sapphire throne, signifies God's righteousness. God's righteousness, holiness, and glory are three divine attributes that keep sinners away from God (see note [link]24[sup]1[/sup] in Gen. 3[/link]). However, Christ came, died on the cross to satisfy the requirements of God's righteousness, holiness, and glory, and was resurrected, and He is now our righteousness, holiness, and glory ([link]1 Cor. 1:30[/link]). Because we, the believers, are now in Christ, in the sight of God we bear the appearance of Christ as righteousness, holiness, and glory. This is the appearance of a rainbow as a testimony of God's faithfulness in sparing us and saving us, the fallen ones, from His judgment on sinners. In the New Jerusalem, a city whose foundations have the appearance of a rainbow ([link]Rev. 21:19-20[/link]), we, the aggregate of the saved ones, will be a rainbow reflecting the brightness of God's righteousness, holiness, and glory and testifying forever that our God is righteous and faithful (see note [link]19[sup]1[/sup], par. 2, in Rev. 21[/link]). As portrayed in this chapter, the Christian life and the church life will consummate in such a rainbow. At that point God's eternal plan will have been accomplished.</note>

        <note num="1">Or, a rebellious nation. The children of Israel were God's elect, separated from the nations unto God ([link]Exo. 19:6[/link]), God's vine for the accomplishing of His economy ([link]15:1-8[/link]; [link]19:10[/link]), God's bride for His satisfaction ([link]16:8[/link]; [link]23:4[/link]), God's flock under His care ([link]ch. 34[/link]), and God's precious and personal treasure ([link]Exo. 19:5[/link]). However, in contrast with these five statuses, in their degradation they became rebels against God ([link]v. 3[/link]), thistles and thorns ([link]v. 6[/link]), a harlot ([link]6:9[/link]; [link]16:15[/link]; [link]23:30[/link]), scorpions ([link]v. 6[/link]), and dross ([link]22:18[/link]). The causes of Israel's degradation were (1) their having idols in their hearts ([link]14:3-5[/link]), (2) their being associated with the world, i.e., the heathen nations ([link]25:8[/link]; cf. [link]1 Kings 11:1-2[/link]; [link]16:30-31[/link]), and (3) their walking according to the manner and customs of the nations ([link]11:12[/link]). These are also the main causes of the degradation of God's New Testament elect, the church ([link]Rev. 2:4[/link], [link]12-15[/link]).[br][br]God's judgment on His people, as seen in [link]chs. 2-24[/link], is based on His righteousness, holiness, and glory. God's glory is versus idols ([link]8:2-4[/link], [link]10[/link]; [link]9:3[/link]), God's holiness is versus dross ([link]22:17-22[/link]), and God's righteousness is versus Israel's injustice and oppression ([link]22:29[/link]). Anything that does not match God's glory, holiness, and righteousness will provoke God's judgment. As seen in this book and in the New Testament, God first judges His people, and then He judges the nations ([link]chs. 25-32[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 4:17[/link]; [link]Rev. 2-3[/link]; [link book="Rev."]6-11[/link]; [link book="Rev."]15-19[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">In the midst of His judgment on Israel, God was merciful to His people and provided a number of things for them: (1) in His mercy God established watchmen, such as Ezekiel, to warn the people ([link]33:7[/link]); (2) before exercising His judgment, God sent His angel to mark out His seeking ones, those who sighed and groaned over all the sinfulness and evils in the city of Jerusalem, so that they would not be killed ([link]9:4[/link]); (3) God preserved and kept a remnant among those who were scattered in captivity ([link]6:8-9[/link]); (4) God Himself was a temporary sanctuary to His scattered and captured people ([link]11:16[/link]); (5) God promised those in the captivity that one day He would bring them back to the land ([link]11:17[/link]), to serve Him on the mountain of the height of Israel ([link]20:40[/link]), which typifies the resurrected and ascended Christ; and (6) for the hope and encouragement of His people, God prophesied that Christ would come as a twig that would become a cedar tree ([link]17:22-23[/link]), as the scepter of Judah ([link]21:10[/link]), as the One who has the right to inherit the kingdom of Israel ([link]21:27[/link]), and as the horn of the house of Israel to deliver them from all oppression and bondage ([link]29:21[/link]). The final result of God's judgment on Israel will be to cause them to turn to Christ and to gain Christ so that Christ will be everything to them ([link]Zech. 12:10[/link]; [link]Rev. 1:7[/link]). Because Israel will be joined to Christ, Israel will ascend from being lowly to being very high, having Christ as the authority to surpass all the nations and authorities on earth. Because of Christ, the nation of Israel will be restored, and Christ will be the King ([link]Isa. 2:2-4[/link] and notes).</note>

Later, during the time of Eli the people of Israel fought against the Philistines with the Ark in a superstitious way and were defeated. The Ark was captured, and the glory of the Lord left the tabernacle ([link]1 Sam. 4[/link]). This means that the Lord gave up the tabernacle. When the temple was built at the time of Solomon, the glory of the Lord returned to fill the temple ([link]1 Kings 8:10-11[/link]). The glory of the Lord remained there until the time when Ezekiel saw it departing, leaving the temple and the city, resting on the Mount of Olives, the place from which the Lord Jesus ascended ([link]Acts 1:9[/link], [link]12[/link]), and finally returning to the heavens.

As such a tender branch, He was "cropped" by being crucified. Man cropped this tender One, but God caused Him to resurrect and to ascend ([link]Acts 2:22-24[/link], [link]32-36[/link]). In this way God planted Christ in a high place, and Christ became a majestic cedar under which many people will dwell. Although the house of David was cropped because of their corruption and thus became desolate and lowly, the day will come when they will be revived in Christ ([link]Amos 9:11[/link] and note). Because they will be joined to Christ, they will become majestic once again.</note>

        <note num="5">In ancient times musical instruments such as tambourines and pipes were for kings ([link]Dan. 3:5[/link]; [link]6:18[/link]). This indicates that before his rebellion Satan was a king, holding the highest position in the preadamic universe (cf. [link]Luke 4:5-6[/link] and note [link]6[sup]1[/sup][/link]; [link]Jude 9[/link] and note 3). Satan was the anointed cherub who covered the Ark ([link]v. 14[/link]; [link]Exo. 25:18-21[/link]), indicating that he was very close to God and bore God's glory ([link]Heb. 9:5[/link]), and might have been the high priest who served God and led the universal worship of God ([link]Rev. 4:6-11[/link]). Thus, Satan was both a king and a priest (cf. [link]Rev. 4:4[/link] and note 2). Because of Satan's failure, these two positions have been given to the believers in Christ ([link]1 Pet. 2:5[/link], [link]9[/link]; [link]Rev. 1:6[/link]; [link]5:10[/link]; [link]2:26-27[/link]; [link]3:21[/link]; [link]12:5[/link]; [link]20:6[/link]; [link]22:3[/link], [link]5[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">In the Bible Egypt is a nation that depends not on God but on its own resources. In addition, the Egyptians exercised their wisdom to develop their natural resources in order to become rich and have a sufficient supply. When the people of Israel were short of food, they went down to Egypt ([link]Gen. 12:10[/link]; [link]42:1-3[/link]). Thus, Egypt represents persons who, independent of God, seek worldly riches by developing their own resources to be rich in supply and to be a source of supply for others. At the time of Ezekiel, Israel turned to Egypt and leaned upon Egypt, trusting in Egypt as a staff. But the Lord said that Egypt was a staff made of reeds, easy to break ([link]vv. 6-7[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">In the Lord's recovery by life there are two aspects: the outward aspect, as seen in [link]ch. 34[/link], and the inward aspect, as seen in [link]vv. 22-33[/link] of this chapter. In the outward recovery we repent, turn to the Lord, and are brought back to the enjoyment of Christ's riches and to God's blessing. In the inward recovery God touches our heart and our spirit and changes us in life and nature.[br][br]In recovering His people, God acts on behalf of His holy name. The inward recovery by life is carried out not because of any merit in ourselves but because God does something in us for His own name (cf. [link]2 Tim. 1:9[/link]; [link]Titus 3:5[/link]).</note>

When the Lord saves us or revives us, He renews our heart, making our stony heart a heart of flesh, a heart that is soft and loving toward Him (cf. [link]2 Cor. 3:3[/link]). Furthermore, He enlivens and renews our spirit with His divine life ([link]Col. 2:13[/link]). As a result, we love the Lord and desire Him with our renewed heart, and we can contact Him, receive Him, and contain Him by exercising our renewed spirit.</note>

        <text>[note]1[/note]In the [note]2[/note][xref]a[/xref]twenty-fifth year of our captivity, at the [note]3[/note]beginning of the year, on the [note]3[/note]tenth [i]day[/i] of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was [xref]b[/xref]struck down, on that same day the [xref]c[/xref]hand of Jehovah was upon me, and He brought me there.</text>
        <note num="1">The three previous sections of this book, concerning the glory of the Lord ([link]ch. 1[/link]), the judgment of God ([link]chs. 2-32[/link]), and the recovery of the Lord ([link]chs. 33-39[/link]), are all for the holy building of God ([link]chs. 40-48[/link]). God's eternal purpose is to have a building as a mingling of Himself with His chosen people. Whatever God does among His people and among the nations on earth is for His building. This is confirmed by the book of Revelation, which is parallel to the book of Ezekiel and concludes with God's ultimate building, the New Jerusalem ([link]Rev. 21:2-22:5[/link]).[br][br]After the destruction of the temple built by Solomon ([link]2 Kings 25:8-9[/link]), the temple was rebuilt by the captives who returned from Babylon ([link]Ezra 3:6b-13[/link]; [link]6:13-15[/link]). Later, this temple was replaced by Herod's temple, which was built in forty-six years ([link]John 2:20[/link]). Herod's temple was destroyed in A.D. 70 by the Roman army under Titus ([link]Dan. 9:26[/link]; [link]Matt. 23:38[/link]; [link]24:2[/link]). Neither the temple in Ezra's day nor the temple of Herod's time was the full recovery of the temple built by Solomon. However, the temple of Ezekiel's vision was a more than full recovery of Solomon's temple. Although the temple itself was the same size as the one built by Solomon ([link]41:2[/link], [link]4[/link]; cf. [link]1 Kings 6:2[/link]), a number of details related to the gates, the courts, and the buildings around the temple in Ezekiel's vision indicate an enlargement over Solomon's temple. Thus, beginning with Abraham's tent (see note [link]18[sup]1[/sup] in Gen. 14[/link]), progressing to the tabernacle and then to Solomon's temple, and concluding with the temple in Ezekiel's vision, there is a continual progression in the enlargement of God's building in the Old Testament. This enlargement signifies a continual increase in the experience of Christ by God's people (cf. note [link]20[sup]1[/sup] in 1 Kings 6[/link]). God's building in the Old Testament prefigures God's spiritual building in the New Testament, which begins with Jesus Christ, the incarnated God, as God's tabernacle ([link]John 1:14[/link]) and God's temple ([link]John 2:19-21[/link]), advances to the church, the Body of Christ, as the enlargement of Christ ([link]Eph. 1:22-23[/link]; [link]2:20-22[/link]), and consummates with the New Jerusalem as the ultimate manifestation and enlargement of God's building in eternity ([link]Rev. 21:2-3[/link], [link]15-17[/link]).[br][br]Literally, the visions concerning God's holy building in [link]chs. 40-48[/link] will be fulfilled in the restoration, when the restored Israel will rebuild the temple and the city of Jerusalem for their dwelling with God in the millennium. The spiritual significances of all the details should be applied to the New Testament believers as components of God's spiritual building, the church.</note>
        <note num="2">Ezekiel saw the first vision, the vision of the appearance of the glory of the Lord, when he was thirty years of age, the age at which a priest began to function ([link]1:1[/link]). He saw the last vision, the vision of the holy building of God, twenty years later (cf. [link]1:2[/link]), at the age of fifty, the age of retirement for a priest ([link]Num. 4:3[/link]). This indicates that to see the building of God, Ezekiel needed more maturity in life (cf. note [link]1[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 1[/link]).</note>
        <note num="3">The beginning of the year indicates that the vision of God's building brings us to a new beginning. The tenth day of the first month was the day on which the people of Israel prepared the lamb for the passover ([link]Exo. 12:3[/link]). This indicates that every new beginning in our Christian life is based on Christ, the Passover lamb ([link]John 1:29[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 5:7[/link]), and His redemption.</note>

        <note num="1">To see the vision of God's holy building, Ezekiel was brought from the land of captivity to a high mountain, signifying the resurrection and ascension of Christ, in the land of Israel, a type of the all-inclusive Christ as the portion allotted by God to His people (see note [link]7[sup]1[/sup] in Deut. 8[/link]), and in the city of Jerusalem. This was the right position, standing, and angle for Ezekiel to see such a vision. See note [link]10[sup]1[/sup] in Rev. 21[/link].</note>

        <note num="1">This man is Christ. In the vision here He is not on the throne in the appearance of electrum ([link]1:26-28[/link]) but at the gate of the building in the appearance of bronze. Bronze signifies Christ's being tested by God's judgment ([link]Num. 16:37-39[/link]; [link]21:8-9[/link]). Having passed through God's judgment, Christ is fully qualified to measure (take possession of by judging) what belongs to God's building ([link]Zech. 2:1[/link] and notes).</note>

        <text>Now there was a [note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]wall all around the outside of the house, and in the man's hand [i]there was[/i] a [xref]b[/xref]measuring reed six cubits long, each [i]cubit being[/i] a [note]2[/note]cubit and a handbreadth. So He measured the thickness of the structure, one reed; and the height, one reed.</text>
        <note num="1">The wall around the house is for separation, separating what belongs to God from what cannot belong to Him. The thickness and height of the wall are both six cubits; thus, a cross section of the wall is a square six cubits by six cubits. The number six signifies man, who was created on the sixth day. Hence, the wall with a square cross section of six cubits signifies Christ Himself as an upright, perfect, and complete man (cf. note [link]16[sup]1[/sup] in Rev. 21[/link]). Such a Christ is the separating line of God's building. Only what is included in Christ belongs to God's interests and God's building ([link]Eph. 2:21[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">The cubit used to measure the holy building of God was not a common human cubit. This indicates that the measuring was done not by the human standard but by the divine standard.</note>

As the entrance to God's building, the gate signifies Christ as the gateway for us to enter into God and into God's interests, God's building, and God's kingdom ([link]John 14:6[/link], [link]20[/link]; [link]Rev. 21:21a[/link]). Whereas the wall separates sinners from God, the gate brings people into God and into God's building. See note [link]21[sup]1[/sup] in Rev. 21[/link].</note>

        <note num="1">Or, little chamber. So also throughout this chapter. The six guardrooms are divided into two groups of three ([link]v. 10[/link]), signifying that the guardrooms are a person, Christ Himself, who as the Triune God (three) became a man (six) and was "split" on the cross. Each of the six guardrooms is six cubits square and is thus the same in size as a cross section of the wall (see note [link]5[sup]1[/sup][/link]). This indicates that the Lord Jesus in His person and work is the guard of God's glory and holiness. By passing through Christ as the gate, we are qualified to enter into God's building, which is full of God's glory and holiness.</note>

The length of the porch is eight cubits ([link]v. 9[/link]), the number eight signifying Christ's resurrection, which took place on the first day of a new week as a new beginning ([link]John 20:1[/link]). These dimensions signify that the Lord Jesus as a man, who is the gate of God's building, is fully in resurrection. They also signify that when we arrive at the porch, we are in resurrection, in a new beginning.</note>

This indicates that at this point in our experience, we are ready to be a burnt offering for God. When we pass through the gate to the inner court, we are in resurrection and on a higher level (see note [link]31[sup]1[/sup][/link]). Here, we are not merely the common people in the outer court; we have become the priests who are ready to minister to the Lord by offering the burnt offering, meaning that we are ready to be absolute for the Lord (see note [link]3[sup]1[/sup] in Lev. 1[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">The eight tables within the north gate are for slaying the offerings ([link]vv. 39-43[/link]). They are divided into two groups of four ([link]v. 41[/link]). They are one and a half cubits square and one cubit high ([link]v. 42[/link]). The number one signifies the unique God. The number three, the sum of the one and a half cubits of length and the one and a half cubits of breadth, signifies the Triune God in resurrection. The Triune God has been "split," as indicated by the tables on the two sides of the gate as well as by the width of each table measuring half of three cubits. Thus, the numbers related to the eight tables signify that the Triune God (three), the unique God (one), who became a creature (four), was "split" on the cross, yet He was resurrected (eight). Now in resurrection He is a testimony (two). Today our service, our ministry, must be in the Triune God, the unique God, who was "split" as a creature and is now in resurrection as a living testimony.</note>

        <note num="1">The altar, which signifies the cross of Christ, is the center not only of the inner court but also of the entire premises of the temple. This altar is actually the center of the universe. As the center of the universe, the cross points to the all-inclusive death of Christ, which involved God, man, and all the creatures (see note [link]13[sup]2[/sup] in ch. 43[/link]). The death on the cross was the release of God ([link]Luke 12:49-50[/link]; [link]John 12:24[/link]) and the termination of man and all negative things ([link]Rom. 6:6[/link]; [link]Heb. 2:14[/link]; [link]9:26-28[/link]; [link]Gal. 6:14[/link]; [link]Eph. 2:14-15[/link]). In Christ's death God passed through death in man to be released, and man died in God to be terminated.[br][br]The cross is not only the center but also the circumference of God's holy building. The cross is implied in the gate, in the eating of the sacrifices, in the boiling houses, and in the tables on which the sacrifices are slain. Thus, the cross spreads in every direction and to every corner of God's building. If we wish to contact God and enjoy His riches in His house, we must pass through the cross.</note>
        <note num="2">Whereas the altar signifies the cross, the temple signifies both Christ ([link]John 2:19-21[/link]) and the church, the Body of Christ ([link]1 Cor. 3:16[/link]; [link]Eph. 2:21[/link]). The cross, Christ, and the church are the central subject not only of the New Testament but also of the entire Bible. That the altar stands in front of the temple indicates that we cannot have the church apart from the cross. We can have the reality of the church only after we have passed through the cross.</note>

This indicates that the further inward we proceed in our experience of God's building, the higher we rise.</note>
        <note num="3">The fact that Ezekiel does not give us the measurement of the pillars indicates that they signify a supporting strength that is unlimited and immeasurable.

The number two in the height of the lesser ledge ([link]v. 14[/link]) signifies not only a testimony but also Christ, the second of the Triune God, who is God's witness ([link]Rev. 1:5a[/link]). The number four in the height of the greater ledge ([link]v. 14[/link]) and the hearth ([link]v. 15[/link]) signifies the creatures ([link]1:5[/link]). The number twelve in the width and length of the hearth ([link]v. 16[/link]) is composed either of six times two or three times four, the number six signifying man, who was created on the sixth day, and the number three, the Triune God. Thus, the measurements of the four sections of the altar signify that Christ's death was all-inclusive, involving God, man, and all the creatures ([link]Acts 20:28[/link]; [link]Rom. 6:6[/link]; [link]Col. 1:15[/link]).</note>

This indicates that Christ's death on the cross is able to hold, to include, all things (cf. notes [link]20[sup]2[/sup] in Col. 1[/link] and [link]9[sup]3[/sup] in Heb. 2[/link]).</note>

The number twelve, therefore, signifies the Triune God mingled with man. The all-inclusive death of Christ, together with His all-conquering resurrection, completed the mingling of God and man in Christ, bringing Christ's humanity into the divine sonship ([link]Rom. 1:3-4[/link] and note [link]4[sup]1[/sup][/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">The altar, signifying the cross of Christ, is the place for God's people to be redeemed (purified) and consecrated (see note [link]7[sup]3[/sup] in Gen. 12[/link]).

They were required to offer a sin offering with the redeeming blood every day for seven days ([link]vv. 25-26[/link]). Then on the eighth day, the day of resurrection, they were to consecrate themselves by offering a burnt offering. Following the burnt offering, they enjoyed the peace offering as a feast with the Lord and His people ([link]v. 27[/link]). This indicates that after the purification, the Lord's people were accepted by Him, became a satisfaction to Him, and had a feast with Him.

To enjoy a flow that is deeper, we need to be tested, examined, judged, and possessed by the Lord.[br][br]As indicated by the four measurings in [link]vv. 3-5[/link], the Lord's judging and testing of us are not once for all.

        <note num="1">In this vision the whole land of Canaan is divided into three portions. The northern portion is for seven tribes ([link]vv. 1-7[/link]), the southern portion is for five tribes ([link]vv. 23-28[/link]), and the middle portion, the holy portion, is a heave offering to God ([link]vv. 8-20[/link]). The middle portion, the holy heave offering, is a square of twenty-five thousand reeds ([link]v. 20[/link]) and is divided into three strips: one part for the priests and the temple ([link]vv. 8-12[/link]), one part for the Levites ([link]vv. 13-14[/link]), and one part for the city with all its workers ([link]vv. 15-20[/link]). The remainder of the land on the west and on the east of the middle portion is assigned to the king, the royal family ([link]v. 21[/link]).[br][br]The picture portrayed by the allotment of the land shows that, in the restoration, from Dan in the north ([link]v. 1[/link]) to Gad in the south ([link]v. 27[/link]), all the Israelites will enjoy Christ, but their nearness to Christ will not be the same. The nearness of the tribes to Christ is determined by their importance. The most important are the priests, who are the closest to Christ and who maintain the fellowship between the people and the Lord. The Levites, who maintain a service to the Lord, are next in nearness to the Lord. Then the workers for the city, who maintain God's government, are the third closest to the Lord. In addition, there is the royal family with the king and the kingship.[br][br]The fellowship of the priests, the service of the Levites, the work to maintain God's government, and the kingship all come out of the riches of the land. According to spiritual significance, this means that in the church all the fellowship, service, work, government, royalty, lordship, and kingship come out of the enjoyment of the riches of Christ. The more we enjoy Christ, the closer we are to Him, and the closer we are to Him, the more important we are in His purpose. The most important are the priests and the kings. According to the New Testament revelation, all the New Testament believers should exercise to be priests and kings ([link]1 Pet. 2:5[/link], [link]9[/link]; [link]Rev. 1:6[/link]; [link]5:10[/link]; [link]20:6[/link]; [link]22:3b-5[/link]).</note>

This city will be the dwelling place of the restored Israel with God in the earthly part of the millennium.

The history of Israel began with Israel's corporate experience of the passover during the exodus from Egypt ([link]Exo. 12[/link]) and will continue until the Lord's second coming, at which time Israel will be restored and will build the earthly Jerusalem with the twelve gates. The history of the church also began with the Passover, which is the Christ who has been sacrificed ([link]1 Cor. 5:7[/link]), and will go on until the millennium, in which the overcoming saints will be the heavenly Jerusalem, the New Jerusalem, with its twelve gates. After the one thousand years the heavenly Jerusalem will be enlarged to become the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth.

The temple and the city typify the church in the present age as the center for the fellowship with God and for the reigning of God ([link]1 Cor. 3:16-17[/link]; [link]Heb. 12:22-23[/link]). In the church as the temple and the city, which is in Christ as the good land, God has His expression, and God and His people enjoy one another mutually and have mutual satisfaction. The church as God's temple and God's city will ultimately consummate in the New Jerusalem for eternity ([link]Rev. 21:2-3[/link], [link]22[/link]).</note>
