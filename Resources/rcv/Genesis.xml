        <text>[note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]In the [note]2[/note]beginning [note]3[/note]God [note]4[/note][xref]b[/xref]created the [note]5[/note]heavens and the earth.</text>
        <note num="1">The Bible, composed of two testaments, the Old Testament and the New Testament, is the complete written divine revelation of God to man. The major revelation in the entire Bible is the unique divine economy of the unique Triune God ([link]Eph. 1:10[/link]; [link]3:9[/link]; [link]1 Tim. 1:4b[/link]). The centrality and universality of this divine economy is the all-inclusive and unsearchably rich Christ as the embodiment and expression of the Triune God ([link]Col. 2:9[/link]; [link]1:15-19[/link]; [link]John 1:18[/link]). The goal of the divine economy is the church as the Body, the fullness, the expression, of Christ ([link]Eph. 1:22b-23[/link]; [link]3:8-11[/link]), which will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the union, mingling, and incorporation of the processed and consummated Triune God and His redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite people. The accomplishing of the divine economy is revealed in the Bible progressively in many steps, beginning with God's creation in [link]Gen. 1-2[/link] and consummating with the New Jerusalem in [link]Rev. 21-22[/link]. In the Old Testament the contents of God's economy are revealed mainly in types, figures, and shadows, whereas in the New Testament all the types, figures, and shadows are fulfilled and realized. Thus, the Old Testament is a figurative portrait of God's eternal economy, and the New Testament is the practical fulfillment.[br][br][i]Genesis,[/i] adopted by the Septuagint as the title of this book, is a Latin word meaning [i]giving of birth, origin.[/i] As the first book in the Bible, Genesis gives birth to and is the origin of the divine truths in the holy Word. Thus, the seeds of the divine truths are sown in this book. These seeds grow and develop in the succeeding books, especially in the New Testament, and are finally harvested in the last book, the book of Revelation.[br][br]The book of Genesis is a miniature of the complete revelation of the entire Bible. It begins with a man created in God's image ([link]1:26[/link]) and ends with a man called Israel ([link]32:28[/link]; [link]48:2[/link]), a transformed person, a man not only outwardly in the image of God but a man in whom God has wrought Himself, making him His expression. The transformed Israel is a seed, a miniature, of the New Jerusalem.[br][br]Apparently, [link book="Gen."]chs. 1-2[/link] of Genesis are merely a record of creation; actually, nearly every item in the record of these two chapters is a revelation of Christ, who is life to God's people ([link]John 1:1[/link], [link]4[/link]; [link]11:25[/link]; [link]14:6[/link]) for the producing and building up of the church. Chapters 3-50 present biographies of eight great persons in two groups of four, representing two races of men: Adam, Abel, Enoch, and Noah, representing the created race, and Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph, representing the called race. What is recorded is not primarily the works of these men but mainly their life, their living, and their way with God. In Genesis God uses both the record of creation and the biographies of eight persons to reveal the life that fulfills His purpose.</note>
        <note num="2">Referring to the beginning of time (cf. [link]John 1:1[/link]). Time began at the creation of the universe and continues until the final judgment at the great white throne ([link]Rev. 20:11-15[/link]). Time is for the accomplishing of God's eternal purpose, which God made in eternity past ([link]Eph. 3:11[/link]) for eternity future.</note>
        <note num="3">Heb. [i]Elohim,[/i] meaning [i]the Mighty One.[/i] The Hebrew name here is plural, but the verb [i]created[/i] is singular. Furthermore, in [link]v. 26[/link] the plural pronouns [i]Us[/i] and [i]Our[/i] are used in reference to God, whereas in [link]v. 27[/link] the pronouns [i]He[/i] and [i]His[/i] are used. These are seeds of the Trinity. God is one ([link]Isa. 45:5[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 8:4[/link]; [link]1 Tim. 2:5[/link]), but He is also three &amp;#8212; the Father, the Son, and the Spirit ([link]Matt. 28:19[/link]). He is the Triune God. It was the Triune God who created. See note [link]14[sup]1[/sup], par. 3, in 2 Cor. 13[/link].[br][br]Genesis is divided into three sections, each beginning with a name. The first section ([link]1:1-2:25[/link]), beginning with the name [i]God,[/i] concerns God's creation; the second ([link]3:1-11:32[/link]), beginning with [i]the serpent,[/i] covers the serpent's corrupting of mankind; and the third ([link]12:1-50:26[/link]), beginning with the name [i]Jehovah,[/i] concerns Jehovah's calling of fallen man.</note>
        <note num="4">[i]Created[/i] here, denoting to bring something into existence out of nothing, differs from [i]made[/i] in [link]2:4[/link] and [i]formed[/i] in [link]2:7[/link], the latter two denoting to take something that already exists and use it to produce something else.[br][br]The motive of God's creation was to fulfill God's desire and to satisfy His good pleasure ([link]Eph. 1:5[/link], [link]9[/link]). The purpose of God's creation is to glorify the Son of God ([link]Col. 1:15-19[/link]) and to manifest God Himself ([link]Psa. 19:1-2[/link]; [link]Rom. 1:20[/link] and notes 1 and 2), especially in man ([link]1 Tim. 3:16[/link]) through His Son, Christ, who is the embodiment of God and the image, the expression, of God ([link]Col. 2:9[/link]; [link]1:15[/link]). The basis of God's creation is God's will and plan ([link]Eph. 1:10[/link] and note 1; [link]Rev. 4:11[/link] and note 2). The means of God's creation were the Son of God ([link]Col. 1:15-16[/link]; [link]Heb. 1:2b[/link]) and the Word of God ([link]Heb. 11:3[/link]; [link]John 1:1-3[/link]), both of whom are Christ ([link]John 1:1[/link], [link]18[/link]; [link]Rev. 19:13[/link]).</note>
        <note num="5">In the process of God's creation, the heavens and the angels therein were created first, and the earth, probably with some living creatures, was created second ([link]Job 38:4-7[/link] and note [link]7[sup]1[/sup][/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">God created the earth in a good order ([link]Job 38:4-7[/link]; [link]Isa. 45:18[/link]). [i]But[/i] here and [i]became[/i] later in this verse indicate that something happened to cause God's creation to become "waste and emptiness." This cataclysmic event was God's judgment on the preadamic universe following Satan's rebellion. This judgment was executed on Satan, on the angels and the preadamic creatures living on the earth who joined Satan in his rebellion, and on the heavens and the earth themselves. See [link]Isa. 14:12-15[/link] and notes; [link]Ezek. 28:12-19[/link] and notes.</note>
        <note num="2">Whenever the words [i]waste[/i] and [i]emptiness[/i] are used together in the Old Testament, they denote a result of God's judgment (cf. [link]Jer. 4:23[/link]; [link]Isa. 24:1[/link]; [link]34:11[/link]). The darkness on the surface of the deep also is a sign of God's judgment (cf. [link]Exo. 10:21-22[/link]; [link]Rev. 16:10[/link]).</note>
        <note num="3">I.e., the deep water. In the Bible water symbolizes either life ([link]John 4:10[/link], [link]14[/link]; [link]7:38[/link]; [link]Rev. 22:1[/link]) or death ([link]7:17-24[/link]; [link]Exo. 14:21-30[/link]; [link]John 3:5[/link]; [link]Rom. 6:3[/link]). The water here signifies death. As a result of God's judgment on the preadamic universe, the entire earth was covered with deep water, signifying that the earth was filled with death and was under death. See notes [link]23[sup]1[/sup] in Mark 1[/link], [link]1[sup]6[/sup] in 1 Tim. 4[/link], and [link]1[sup]3[/sup] in Rev. 21[/link].</note>
        <note num="4">[link]Verse 1[/link] is a record of God's original creation. [link]Verse 2a[/link] refers to God's judgment on the preadamic universe. The entire section from 1:2b-2:3 refers not to God's original creation but to God's restoration of the damaged universe, plus His further creation, in six days.</note>
        <note num="5">Heb. [i]ruach,[/i] variously translated [i]spirit, wind, breath.[/i] This is the first mentioning of the Spirit in the Bible. The Spirit of God, as the Spirit of life ([link]Rom. 8:2[/link]), came to brood over the waters of death in order to generate life, especially man ([link]v. 26[/link]), for God's purpose. In spiritual experience, the Spirit's coming is the first requirement for generating life ([link]John 6:63a[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">After the Spirit's brooding ([link]v. 2b[/link]), the word of God came to bring in the light (cf. [link]Psa. 119:105[/link], [link]130[/link]). In spiritual experience, the coming of the word is the second requirement for generating life ([link]John 5:24[/link]; [link]6:63b[/link]), and the coming of the light is the third requirement ([link]Matt. 4:13-16[/link]; [link]John 1:1-13[/link]).[br][br]The Spirit, the word, and the light were the instruments used by God to generate life for the fulfillment of His purpose. The Spirit, the word, and the light are all of life ([link]Rom. 8:2[/link]; [link]Phil. 2:16[/link]; [link]John 8:12b[/link]). Christ as the Spirit is the reality of God ([link]Rom. 8:9-10[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 3:17[/link]; [link]John 16:13-15[/link]); Christ as the Word is the speaking of God ([link]John 1:1[/link]; [link]Heb. 1:2[/link]); and Christ as the light is the shining of God ([link]John 8:12a[/link]; [link]9:5[/link]).</note>

[link]vv. 4[/link], [link]10[/link], [link]12[/link], [link]18[/link], [link]21[/link], [link]25[/link]).

        <note num="1">The appearing of the dry land is the sixth requirement for generating life. This took place on the third day, corresponding to the day of resurrection ([link]1 Cor. 15:4[/link]). In the Bible the sea represents death and the land represents Christ (see note [link]7[sup]1[/sup] in Deut. 8[/link]) as the generating source of life. After the land appeared, every kind of life &amp;#8212; the plant life, the animal life, and even the human life &amp;#8212; was produced out of the land ([link]vv. 11-12[/link], [link]24-27[/link]; [link]2:7[/link]). This typifies that the divine life with all its riches comes out of Christ. On the third day Christ came out of death in resurrection to generate life ([link]John 12:24[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 1:3[/link]) for the constituting of the church.</note>

        <note num="1">Dividing the land from the waters signifies separating life from death. From the second day ([link]vv. 6-7[/link]) God began to work to confine and limit the waters of death that covered the earth (cf. [link]Jer. 5:22[/link]). Eventually, when God's work is completed, in the new heaven and new earth there will be no more sea ([link]Rev. 21:1[/link] and note 3). Furthermore, in the New Jerusalem there will be no more night ([link]Rev. 21:25[/link] and note 2). This means that both death and darkness will be eliminated.</note>

The moon can be considered a figure of the church, the wife of Christ (cf. [link]S.S. 6:10[/link]). The moon has no light of its own but shines in the night by reflecting the light of the sun. Likewise, the church shines in the dark night of the church age by reflecting the divine light of Christ (cf. [link]Phil. 2:15[/link]).</note>
        <note num="4">The stars first signify Christ ([link]Num. 24:17[/link]; [link]2 Pet. 1:19[/link]; [link]Rev. 22:16b[/link]). Although Christ is the real sun, He does not appear as the sun during the present age of night. Rather, He shines as the bright morning star ([link]Rev. 22:16[/link] and note 4). The stars also signify the overcoming saints ([link]Dan. 12:3[/link]; cf. [link]Rev. 1:20[/link]). The light from the stars is needed particularly when the moon wanes; likewise, the shining of the overcoming saints as the heavenly stars is needed particularly in the time of the church's degradation ([link]Rev. 2:7[/link], [link]11[/link], [link]17[/link], [link]26-28[/link]; [link]3:5[/link], [link]12[/link], [link]20-21[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">This is the animal life with the lowest consciousness, corresponding to the first step in the believers' growth in life (cf. [link]1 John 2:13[/link]). The animal life in the sea typifies the riches of the life of Christ in the power that overcomes death (signified by the salt water) in His living. Just as fish can live in salt water without becoming salty, Christ and His believers, who have the divine life, can live in the satanic world without being "salted" by the world's corruption (cf. [link]John 14:30[/link]; [link]17:15-16[/link]). The animal life in the sea also shows the riches of Christ's life in feeding man with His riches ([link]John 6:9a[/link]; [link]21:9[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">The cattle and the animals on the earth are a higher life with a higher consciousness than that of the fish and the birds, a life that can accomplish something on the earth. The animals and the cattle on the land typify the riches of the life of Christ as seen in Christ as the conquering lion ([link]Rev. 5:5[/link]) to fight for God's economy, as seen in Christ as the sheep and oxen for offering to God for the fulfillment of God's full redemption ([link]Lev. 1:2-3[/link], [link]10[/link]; [link]3:1[/link], [link]6[/link], [link]12[/link]; [link]4:3[/link]; [link]5:6[/link]; [link]John 1:29[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 1:19[/link]; [link]Rev. 5:6-9[/link]), and as seen in Christ as the ox to bear the responsibility and to labor faithfully for the accomplishing of God's will ([link]Matt. 20:28[/link]; [link]John 6:38[/link]).

        <note num="1">[i]Let Us...[/i] reveals that a council was held among the three of the Godhead regarding the creation of man. The decision to create man had been made by the Triune God in eternity past, indicating that the creation of man was for the eternal purpose of the Triune God ([link]Eph. 3:9-11[/link]). God's intention in creating man was to carry out His divine economy for the dispensing of Himself into man ([link]1 Tim. 1:4[/link] and note 3, par. 1). This is fully unveiled in the following books of the Bible.</note>
        <note num="2">Or, mankind; Heb. [i]adam[/i]. So also in the next verse. The human life is the highest created life, the life that can express God in His image and likeness and can exercise dominion for God. Adam, the first man, typifies Christ ([link]Rom. 5:14[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 15:45[/link], [link]47[/link]; [link]Psa. 8:4-8[/link]; [link]Heb. 2:6-9[/link]) as the center of God's creation ([link]Col. 1:16-17[/link]), as the Head of all creation ([link]Col. 1:15[/link]) and of all men ([link]1 Cor. 11:3[/link]), as God's expression in God's image and likeness ([link]Heb. 1:3[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 4:4[/link]; [link]Col. 1:15[/link]), and as God's representative to rule over all things created by God ([link]Psa. 8:6-8[/link]; [link]Matt. 28:18[/link]).</note>
        <note num="3">God's image, referring to God's inner being, is the expression of the inward essence of God's attributes, the most prominent of which are love ([link]1 John 4:8[/link]), light ([link]1 John 1:5[/link]), holiness ([link]Rev. 4:8[/link]), and righteousness ([link]Jer. 23:6[/link]). God's likeness, referring to God's form ([link]Phil. 2:6[/link]), is the expression of the essence and nature of God's person. Thus, God's image and God's likeness should not be considered as two separate things. Man's inward virtues, created in man's spirit, are copies of God's attributes and are the means for man to express God's attributes. Man's outward form, created as man's body, is a copy of God's form. Thus, God created man to be a duplication of Himself that man may have the capacity to contain God and express Him. All the other living things were created "according to their kind" ([link]vv. 11-12[/link], [link]21[/link], [link]24-25[/link]), but man was created according to God's kind (cf. [link]Acts 17:28-29a[/link]). Since God and man are of the same kind, it is possible for man to be joined to God and to live together with Him in an organic union ([link]John 15:5[/link]; [link]Rom. 6:5[/link]; [link]11:17-24[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 6:17[/link]).[br][br]Christ the Son, as God's embodiment ([link]Col. 2:9[/link]), is the image of the invisible God, the expression of the essence of God's attributes ([link]Col. 1:15[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 4:4[/link]; [link]Heb. 1:3[/link]). Man was created according to Christ with the intention that Christ would enter into man and be expressed through man ([link]Col. 1:27[/link]; [link]Phil. 1:20-21a[/link]). Created man is a living vessel, a container, to contain Christ ([link]Rom. 9:21[/link], [link]23[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 4:7[/link]). Eventually, in His incarnation Christ put on human nature and became in the likeness of men ([link]Phil. 2:6-8[/link]) so that through His death and resurrection man may obtain God's eternal, divine life ([link]1 Pet. 1:3[/link]; [link]1 John 5:11-12[/link]) and by that life be transformed and conformed to the image of Christ inwardly ([link]2 Cor. 3:18[/link]; [link]Rom. 8:29[/link]) and transfigured into the likeness of Christ's glorious body outwardly ([link]Phil. 3:21[/link]) that he may be the same as Christ ([link]1 John 3:2b[/link]) and may express God with Him to the universe ([link]Eph. 3:21[/link]).[br][br]Created man was a duplication of God in God's image and likeness, but he did not have the reality of God or the life of God. Thus, he still needed to receive God as his life by eating of the tree of life so that he might have the reality of God to express Him ([link]2:9[/link] and note 2).</note>
        <note num="4">The pronouns [i]them[/i] here and in [link]vv. 27-28[/link] and [i]their[/i] in [link]5:2[/link] indicate that Adam was a corporate man, a collective man, including all mankind. God did not create many men; He created mankind collectively in one person, Adam. God created such a corporate man in His image and according to His likeness so that mankind might express God corporately.</note>
        <note num="5">God created a corporate man not only to express Himself with His image but also to represent Him by exercising His dominion over all things. God's intention in giving man dominion is (1) to subdue God's enemy, Satan, who rebelled against God; (2) to recover the earth, which was usurped by Satan; and (3) to exercise God's authority over the earth in order that the kingdom of God may come to the earth, the will of God may be done on the earth, and the glory of God may be manifested on the earth ([link]Matt. 6:10[/link], [link]13b[/link]).[br][br]God's intention that man would express God in His image and represent God with His dominion is fulfilled not in Adam as the first man ([link]1 Cor. 15:45a[/link]), the old man ([link]Rom. 6:6[/link]), but in Christ as the second man ([link]1 Cor. 15:47b[/link] and note 2), the new man ([link]Eph. 2:15[/link] and note 8), comprising Christ Himself as the Head and the church as His Body ([link]Eph. 1:22-23[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 12:12[/link] and note 2; [link]Col. 3:10-11[/link] and note 11[sup]9[/sup]). It is fully fulfilled in the overcoming believers, who live Christ for His corporate expression ([link]Phil. 1:19-26[/link]) and will have authority over the nations and reign as co-kings with Christ in the millennium ([link]Rev. 2:26-27[/link]; [link]20:4[/link], [link]6[/link]). It will ultimately be fulfilled in the New Jerusalem, which will express God's image, having His glory and bearing His appearance ([link]Rev. 4:3a[/link]; [link]21:11[/link], [link]18a[/link]), and also exercise God's divine authority to maintain God's dominion over the entire universe for eternity ([link]Rev. 21:24[/link]; [link]22:5[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">God rested because He had finished His work and was satisfied. God's glory was manifested because man had His image, and His authority was about to be exercised for the subduing of His enemy, Satan. As long as man expresses God and deals with God's enemy, God is satisfied and can rest.[br][br]Later, the seventh day was commemorated as the Sabbath ([link]Exo. 20:8-11[/link]). God's seventh day was man's first day. God had prepared everything for man's enjoyment. After man was created, he did not join in God's work; he entered into God's rest. Man was created not to work but to be satisfied with God and rest with God (cf. [link]Matt. 11:28-30[/link]). The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath ([link]Mark 2:27[/link]).[br][br]The rest here is a seed that develops through the Bible and is harvested in Revelation.

[i]neshamah,[/i] translated [i]spirit[/i] in [link]Prov. 20:27[/link], indicating that the breath of life breathed into man's body became the spirit of man, the human spirit (cf. [link]Job 32:8[/link]). Man's spirit is his inward organ for him to contact God, receive God, contain God, and assimilate God into his entire being as his life and his everything. It was specifically formed by God and is ranked in importance with the heavens and the earth in God's holy Word ([link]Zech. 12:1[/link]). The spirit of man is for man to worship God ([link]John 4:24[/link]), to be regenerated by God ([link]John 3:6b[/link]), and to be joined to God ([link]1 Cor. 6:17[/link]; [link]2 Tim. 4:22[/link]) that man may walk and live in an organic union with God ([link]Rom. 8:4b[/link]) to fulfill God's purpose.[br][br]The breath of life breathed into man's nostrils was not the eternal life of God nor the Spirit of God. See note [link]38[sup]2[/sup] in Luke 3[/link]. Man did not receive the Spirit of God until the Lord breathed the Holy Spirit into His disciples on the day of His resurrection ([link]John 20:22[/link]). Nevertheless, because the human spirit came out of God's breath of life, it is very close to the Spirit of God. Thus, there can be a transmission between God the Spirit and man's spirit, and the human spirit is able to contact God and be one with God ([link]Rom. 8:16[/link] and note 2; [link]1 Cor. 6:17[/link] and note 2).[br][br]Within man's spirit there are three functions: conscience, enabling man to know what God justifies and what He condemns ([link]Rom. 9:1[/link] and note 2); fellowship, that man may contact God, worship God, and commune with God ([link]John 4:24[/link]; [link]Eph. 6:18a[/link]; [link]Rom. 1:9[/link]); and intuition, giving man a direct sense of God and a direct knowledge from God ([link]Mark 2:8[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 2:11[/link]).</note>
        <note num="6">Man's soul, which is his person, his very self ([link]Exo. 1:5[/link]; [link]Acts 2:41[/link]), was not formed from a certain element but was produced by the combining of the human spirit and the human body. The soul, composed of man's mind, emotion, and will, has the psychological consciousness to contact the psychological realm.[br][br]God is triune &amp;#8212; the Father, the Son, and the Spirit ([link]Matt. 28:19[/link]) &amp;#8212; and man is tripartite &amp;#8212; spirit and soul and body ([link]1 Thes. 5:23[/link]). The Triune God created such a tripartite man to be a living vessel that man may have the capacity to contain God and be joined to God organically ([link]John 15:4-5[/link]; [link]Rom. 11:17-24[/link]) to be His organism for His expression in humanity.

        <note num="2">The second step of God's procedure in fulfilling His purpose was to place the created man in front of the tree of life, which signifies the Triune God embodied in Christ as life to man in the form of food. God's placing man in front of the tree of life indicates that God wanted man to receive Him as man's life by eating Him organically and assimilating Him metabolically, that God might become the very constituent of man's being. According to [link]John 1:1[/link], [link]4[/link], life is in the Word, who is God Himself. This life &amp;#8212; the divine, eternal, uncreated life of God &amp;#8212; is Christ ([link]John 11:25[/link]; [link]14:6[/link]; [link]Col. 3:4a[/link]), who is the embodiment of God ([link]Col. 2:9[/link]). The tree of life grows along the two sides of the river of water of life ([link]Rev. 22:1-2[/link]), indicating that it is a vine. Since Christ is a vine tree ([link]John 15:1[/link]) and is also life, He is the tree of life. He was processed through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection that man might have life and live by eating Him ([link]John 10:10b[/link]; [link]6:51[/link], [link]57[/link], [link]63[/link]).</note>
        <note num="3">The tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies Satan as the source of death to man ([link]Heb. 2:14[/link]). It also signifies all things apart from God, for anything that is not God Himself, including good things and even scriptural things and religious things, can be utilized by Satan, the subtle one, to bring death to man. Even the Scriptures inspired by God and the law given by God can be utilized by Satan as the tree of knowledge to bring in death ([link]John 5:39-40[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 3:6b[/link]).[br][br]The tree of life causes man to be dependent on God ([link]John 15:5[/link]), whereas the tree of knowledge causes man to rebel against God and to be independent from Him (cf. [link]3:5[/link]). The two trees issue in two lines &amp;#8212; the line of life and the line of death &amp;#8212; that run through the entire Bible and end in the book of Revelation. Death begins with the tree of knowledge ([link]v. 17[/link]) and ends with the lake of fire ([link]Rev. 20:10[/link], [link]14[/link]). Life begins with the tree of life and ends in the New Jerusalem, the city of the water of life ([link]Rev. 22:1-2[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">The flow of the river issued in three precious materials: gold, bdellium, and onyx. These materials typify the Triune God as the basic elements of the structure of God's eternal building. Gold typifies God the Father with His divine nature, which man may partake of through God's calling ([link]2 Pet. 1:3-4[/link]), as the base of God's eternal building; bdellium, a pearl-like material produced from the resin of a tree, typifies the produce of God the Son in His redeeming and life-releasing death ([link]John 19:34[/link]) and His life-dispensing resurrection ([link]John 12:24[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 1:3[/link]), as the entry into God's eternal building (cf. [link]Rev. 21:21[/link] and note 1, par. 1); and onyx, a precious stone, typifies the produce of God the Spirit with His transforming work ([link]2 Cor. 3:18[/link]) for the building up of God's eternal building. The New Jerusalem is constructed of these three categories of materials &amp;#8212; gold, pearl, and precious stones ([link]Rev. 21:11[/link], [link]18-21[/link]). See note [link]21[sup]1[/sup], par. 2, in Rev. 21[/link].[br][br]The breastplate of the high priest, a symbol of Israel as God's Old Testament people, was constructed of gold and precious stones ([link]Exo. 28:6-21[/link]), and the church in the New Testament is built with gold, silver, and precious stones ([link]1 Cor. 3:12[/link] &amp;#8212; there silver, signifying Christ's redemption, is listed instead of bdellium or pearl because of man's need of redemption after the fall). This indicates that the New Jerusalem includes the totality of God's chosen and redeemed people &amp;#8212; Israel plus the church (see notes [link book="Rev." chapter="21"]12[sup]4[/sup][/link] and [link]14[sup]2[/sup] in Rev. 21[/link]).[br][br]The flowing of the divine life in man brings the divine nature into man ([link]2 Pet. 1:4[/link]), regenerates man ([link]1 Pet. 1:3[/link]), and transforms man into the glorious image of Christ ([link]2 Cor. 3:18[/link]). Thus, man, who was created of dust ([link]v. 7[/link]), becomes transformed precious materials for God's building, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem.</note>

Man's outcome and destiny before God depends altogether on what he eats. If man eats the tree of life, he will receive God as life and fulfill God's purpose; if he eats the tree of knowledge, he will receive Satan as death and be usurped by him for his purpose.[br][br]God's forbidding commandment given as a warning to man indicates (1) God's greatness in creating man with a free will that man may choose God willingly and not under coercion; (2) God's love for man; and (3) God's desire that man would eat the tree of life to receive God into him as life.</note>

        <note num="1">In order to produce a complement for Himself, God first became a man ([link]John 1:14[/link]), as typified by God's creation of Adam ([link]Rom. 5:14[/link]). Here Adam's deep sleep for the producing of Eve as his wife typifies Christ's death on the cross for the producing of the church as His counterpart ([link]Eph. 5:25-27[/link]). Through Christ's death the divine life within Him was released, and through His resurrection His released divine life was imparted into His believers for the constituting of the church (see note [link]34[sup]1[/sup] in John 19[/link]).

        <note num="1">The outward cause of man's first fall was the serpent's temptation. The inward cause was the woman's assuming the headship ([link]vv. 2-3[/link], [link]6[/link]). The woman represents man's position in relation to God. God is man's Husband ([link]Isa. 54:5[/link]); man's position is that of the wife. As the man should be under the headship of God, so the woman should be under the headship of man ([link]1 Cor. 11:3[/link]). This is a safeguard against the subtlety of the enemy. Here Eve assumed the headship by speaking to the serpent directly, without the covering of her husband. Thus, she was ensnared by the serpent and was deceived ([link]1 Tim. 2:14[/link]). Eve's failure here typifies man's failure in putting God aside and assuming the headship over God to act independently of Him, thus opening the way for Satan, the subtle one, to deceive man.

        <note num="1">The dreadful result of man's first fall was manifold. First, man transgressed God's commandment ([link]2:17[/link]; [link]Rom. 5:14[/link]) and thus fell under God's condemnation ([link]Rom. 5:16[/link]) and came under a curse ([link]vv. 17-19[/link]). He also became estranged from God ([link]v. 8[/link]) and alienated from the life of God ([link]Eph. 4:18[/link]) in the tree of life ([link]vv. 23-24[/link]). Not only so, in the fall Satan's evil thought, feeling, and will were injected into man's mind, emotion, and will, thus contaminating man's soul ([link]vv. 1[/link], [link]4-6[/link]). Through man's eating of the tree of knowledge, Satan entered man's body and became the very sin within man (cf. [link]Rom. 7:8[/link], [link]11[/link], [link]17[/link], [link]20[/link] and note [link]8[sup]1[/sup][/link]). Thus the human body, which was created pure and sinless, was transmuted into the flesh of sin ([link]Rom. 7:18a[/link] and note 2). As a consequence of the fall man's spirit was deadened (cf. [link]Eph. 2:1[/link], [link]5[/link] and note [link]1[sup]2[/sup][/link]), becoming insulated from God and losing its function toward God. Hence, each of man's three parts &amp;#8212; his body, his soul, and his spirit &amp;#8212; was damaged by the fall. Furthermore, fallen man was constituted a sinner ([link]Rom. 5:19[/link]) and became a victim of death ([link]Rom. 5:12b[/link], [link]14a[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 15:22a[/link]). Consequently, man was spoiled from fulfilling God's purpose, which is to express God in His image and represent God with His dominion ([link]1:26[/link]). Finally, because of man's fall all the creation is subjected to vanity and the slavery of corruption ([link]Rom. 8:20-21[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">This is the beginning of the function of the human conscience. The conscience, being a function of man's spirit (see note [link]7[sup]5[/sup], par. 3, in ch. 2[/link]), came into being at the time man was created by God. However, it was not until after man partook of the tree of knowledge that the function of the conscience was manifested. After the fall Adam was ashamed of his nakedness (cf. [link]2:25[/link]) because the function of his conscience was activated. From that time the conscience in man began to bear the responsibility of refusing evil and accepting good. See note [link]1[sup]2[/sup] in Rom. 9[/link].</note>
        <note num="3">Fig leaves are of the vegetable life, which has no blood for redemption (cf. [link]Heb. 9:22[/link]).

[link]Rom. 3:20a[/link]). See notes [link]21[sup]1[/sup][/link] and [link]21[sup]2[/sup][/link].</note>

Thus, He had to rescue the man whom He had created for His unchanging purpose, even at the cost of sacrificing His only begotten Son ([link]John 3:16[/link]). It is for this reason that even in eternity past Christ as the second of the Divine Trinity was preparing to come into time ([link]Micah 5:2[/link]) to die for fallen man according to the divine determination made in the council of the Divine Trinity in eternity past ([link]Acts 2:23[/link] and note 1; [link]1 Pet. 1:18-20[/link] and note [link]20[sup]1[/sup][/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">Immediately after the fall, Adam and Eve knew that the result of their transgression was to be death (cf. [link]Rom. 1:32a[/link]; [link]6:23a[/link]).

        <note num="1">The woman here signifies first Eve and then the virgin Mary, the mother of the Lord Jesus ([link]Gal. 4:4[/link]). She also signifies all the people of God who take the position of a woman before God, trusting in Him (see note [link]2[sup]1[/sup] in Gen. 3[/link]), as represented by the universal woman in [link]Rev. 12:1[/link] (see note there). Thus, the enmity between the serpent and the woman is the enmity between Satan and all God's people (see note [link]4[sup]2[/sup] in Rev. 12[/link]). The serpent's hating and fighting against God's people began when Satan instigated Cain to murder Abel ([link]4:8[/link]; [link]1 John 3:12[/link]) and continues through all the generations until Satan is cast into the lake of fire for eternity ([link]Rev. 20:7-10[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">The serpent's seed are the people who follow Satan. Because Satan, the old serpent ([link]Rev. 12:9[/link]; [link]20:2[/link]), has injected himself as sin into man's flesh (see note [link]18[sup]2[/sup] in Rom. 7[/link]), all men have become serpents in the eyes of God ([link]Matt. 23:33[/link]). As Satan's followers, they are his sons, his seed, not by adoption but by birth ([link]Matt. 3:7[/link]; [link]13:38[/link]; [link]John 8:44[/link]; [link]1 John 3:10[/link]). Thus, they have the serpentine nature and life. They are used by Satan to persecute and fight against the woman's seed.</note>
        <note num="3">The seed of the woman is the incarnated Jesus Christ, who as the very God was born of the virgin Mary to be a man, as prophesied in [link]Isa. 7:14[/link], fulfilled in [link]Matt. 1:23[/link], and confirmed in [link]Gal. 4:4[/link]. Thus, the promise here indicates that God Himself would come to be a human seed to bruise the head of the damaging serpent. Ultimately, the seed of the woman is enlarged to include the overcoming believers, the stronger part of God's people, signified by the man-child in [link]Rev. 12:5[/link] (see note 2 there). The man-child, the corporate seed of the woman, includes the Lord Jesus, the individual seed of the woman. [link]Psalm 2:8-9[/link], [link]Rev. 2:26-27[/link], and [link]Rev. 12:5[/link] indicate that the Lord Jesus as God's Anointed, the overcomers in the churches, and the man-child will rule the nations with an iron rod, thus proving that the Lord Jesus, the overcomers, and the man-child are one. The Lord as the leading Overcomer ([link]Rev. 3:21[/link]) is the Head, center, reality, life, and nature of the man-child, and the man-child as the following overcomers is the Lord's Body.</note>
        <note num="4">The bruising of the serpent's head by the seed of the woman is the destroying of Satan, the one who has the might of death, by the Lord Jesus through His death on the cross ([link]Heb. 2:14[/link] and note; [link]1 John 3:8[/link]). While the Lord was destroying the serpent on the cross, the serpent bruised His heel, i.e., wounded Him by nailing His feet to the cross ([link]Psa. 22:16[/link]).[br][br]Through the Lord's death on the cross, Satan, the old serpent, was judged, cast out ([link]John 12:31[/link]; [link]16:11[/link]). That judgment will ultimately be carried out by the overcomers as the man-child, the corporate seed of the woman ([link]Rev. 12:9[/link] and note 1).</note>

        <note num="1">Probably the skins of lambs sacrificed as substitutes for the sinful Adam and Eve, with the shedding of blood for the forgiveness of sins ([link]Heb. 9:22[/link]). The killing of the lambs by God foreshadowed the substitutionary death of Christ as the Lamb of God, with the shedding of His precious blood for the accomplishing of redemption, based on which God justifies the believing sinners ([link]John 1:29[/link]; [link]Rev. 13:8b[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 1:18-20[/link]; [link]3:18a[/link]; [link]Eph. 1:7[/link]; [link]Rom. 3:24[/link]).[br][br]God's clothing Adam and his wife with the coats of skins means that God justified them through their faith ([link]Rom. 3:28[/link]). The coats are a type of Christ as God's righteousness to cover us that we might be justified by God ([link]Jer. 23:6[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 1:30[/link]). They were made by God and replaced the coverings of fig leaves sown by Adam ([link]v. 7[/link]). See note [link]22[sup]5[/sup] in Luke 15[/link].</note>
        <note num="2">Genuine substitution is based on union. After being clothed by God with a coat of lamb skins, Adam became one with the lamb. Thus, the sinner became one with the substitute. This is union. Union brings in the effectiveness of substitution. When we believe in the gospel, Christ is put upon us as our covering righteousness (cf. [link]Luke 15:22[/link]), and we are put into Christ ([link]1 Cor. 1:30[/link]), making us one with Christ. Since we are one with Christ, whatever He has accomplished on the cross becomes ours. To believe in Jesus Christ is to be one with Him, to enter into a union with Him (see note [link]16[sup]2[/sup] in John 3[/link]). In such a union, whatever Christ is, whatever He has, whatever He has done and will do, and whatever He has attained and obtained are ours.

They were still sinful in nature. If they had eaten of the tree of life while in that condition, they would have lived forever with their sinful nature. God did not allow that. The tree of life, signifying God as life to man, must not be touched by sinful man. Thus, before the actual redemption was accomplished, God had to close the way to the tree of life. Once the actual redemption was completed to take away man's sin ([link]John 1:29[/link]) and terminate man's sinful nature ([link]John 3:14[/link] and note; [link]Rom. 8:3[/link] and note 3), access to the tree of life would again be possible ([link]Rev. 22:14[/link]).</note>

Cain's way of worshipping God was to invent a religion according to his human concept and opinion ([link]Jude 11[/link] and note 1), which were motivated by Satan, the subtle one ([link]v. 7[/link] and note; [link]1 John 3:12[/link]).

        <note num="1">According to [link]Heb. 11:4[/link], Abel's offering, a sacrifice, was offered to God by faith. Faith comes by hearing the word of the gospel ([link]Rom. 10:17[/link], [link]14[/link]). This indicates that Abel's parents, Adam and Eve, must have proclaimed to their children the glad tidings that God had announced to them ([link]3:15[/link], [link]21[/link]). Like his father and mother, Abel believed the gospel and presented his offering to God according to God's revelation in the word proclaimed by his parents. Thus, the first family on earth was a family of the gospel, a family of believers.[br][br]Abel was the first priest of God, representing all the believers in Christ ([link]1 Pet. 2:5[/link], [link]9[/link]). In type, Abel offered Christ to God. According to [link]Num. 18:17[/link], the firstling of a cow or sheep or goat, a type of Christ, had to be offered to God. This offering included the sprinkling of the blood upon the altar for redemption and the burning of the fat as a satisfying fragrance to God. Hence, Abel's offering, corresponding exactly with what was later revealed in the Mosaic law, proves that his way of worshipping God was according to God's divine revelation, not according to his own concept.</note>

This preparation was initiated in a man, Adam ([link]1:1-11:26[/link]), and eventually issued in three persons, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with Joseph ([link]11:27-50:26[/link]), who resulted in one people, Israel (Exo.-Mal.). The thirty-nine books of the Old Testament reveal the preparation for bringing forth Christ, the God-man, the complete God mingled with the perfect man ([link]Matt. 1[/link]), for the producing of the Body of Christ ([link]Eph. 1-4[/link]), the organism of the processed and consummated Triune God ([link]Eph. 4:4-6[/link]).

[link]John 3:30[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 12:12[/link]), the eternal mingling of the Triune God with the tripartite man and the mutual dwelling of God and man ([link]Rev. 21:3[/link], [link]22[/link]) for the expression of the processed and consummated Triune God in His nature and glory ([link]Rev. 21:18b[/link], [link]21b[/link], [link]10-11[/link], [link]23[/link]) in the redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite man for eternity.</note>

        <text>And Jehovah said, My [note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]Spirit will not strive with man forever, for he indeed is [note]2[/note][xref]b[/xref]flesh; so his days will be [xref]c[/xref]one hundred twenty years.</text>
        <note num="1">This is the second mentioning of the Spirit in this book (cf. [link]1:2[/link]). Before this time God's Spirit was graciously working and striving with man to counter man's rebellion and fall. Nevertheless, here a point was reached when the Spirit of God would strive with man no longer, signifying God's forsaking of man.</note>
        <note num="2">In man's first fall man did not exercise his spirit (see note [link]6[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 3[/link]); in the second fall he over-exercised his soul, inventing a new religion (see note [link]3[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 4[/link]). In the third fall man abused the fallen body and became flesh, full of lusts, fornication, and violence ([link]vv. 2[/link], [link]5[/link], [link]11[/link]). The fallen flesh is the strongest and most evil enemy of God ([link]Rom. 7:5-8:13[/link]) and is thoroughly and absolutely hated by God. At the time of the third fall the entire human race became flesh. Thus, God stepped in and told His servant Noah that He would destroy that whole generation ([link]vv. 7[/link], [link]13[/link]). This is a prefigure of the age immediately preceding the Lord's coming back ([link]Matt. 24:37-39[/link]).</note>

As a result, he became heir of God's righteousness (cf. [link]Rom. 4:3[/link], [link]9[/link]) and a herald of righteousness ([link]2 Pet. 2:5[/link]) as a protest against the evil generation.

        <note num="1">The ark is a type of Christ ([link]1 Pet. 3:20-21[/link]), not only the individual Christ but also the corporate Christ, the church, which is the Body of Christ and the new man ([link]1 Cor. 12:12[/link]; [link]Eph. 2:15-16[/link]; [link]Col. 3:10-11[/link]). The building of the ark typifies the building of the corporate Christ, with the element of Christ's riches as the building material, by those who work together with God ([link]1 Cor. 3:9-12a[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 6:1[/link]; [link]Eph. 3:8-10[/link]; [link]4:12[/link]). By building the ark and entering into it, Noah was not only saved from God's judgment on the evil generation through the flood, but was also separated from that generation and ushered into a new age ([link]1 Pet. 3:20[/link] and note 3). Likewise, by building the church and entering into the church life, we will be saved from God's judgment on today's evil generation through the great tribulation ([link]Matt. 24:37-39[/link]; [link]Luke 17:26-27[/link]; [link]1 Thes. 5:3[/link]) and will be separated from that generation ([link]Luke 21:36[/link]; [link]Rev. 3:10[/link]) and ushered into a new age, the age of the millennium.</note>

        <note num="3">The root of the words pitch in this verse and expiation elsewhere in the Old Testament means primarily to cover. The pitch here is a type of the redeeming blood of Christ, which covers God's building within and without ([link]Lev. 4:5-7[/link]; [link]6:30[/link]; [link]16:14-19[/link]; [link]Heb. 9:21[/link]). The pitch within the ark was for the peace of Noah and his family (cf. [link]Heb. 9:14[/link]), whereas the pitch without was for God's satisfaction (cf. [link]Exo. 12:13[/link]). Noah and his family were saved from the judgment of the flood by the pitch on the ark, signifying that the believers in Christ are saved from God's judgment by the redeeming blood of Christ ([link]Rom. 5:9[/link]).[br][br]In order for the pitch on the ark to be effective, Noah and his family had to be in the ark, i.e., in union with the ark. Likewise, in order to apply the redemption through Christ's blood, we must be in Christ, i.e., in union with Him by believing into Him ([link]John 3:16[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 1:30[/link]; [link]Eph. 1:7[/link]). See notes [link]21[sup]2[/sup] in ch. 3[/link], [link]22[sup]2[/sup] in Exo. 12[/link], and [link]2[sup]2[/sup] in 1 John 2[/link].</note>

        <note num="1">Noah built the ark not according to his own imagination but absolutely according to God's revelation. Cf. [link]Exo. 25:9[/link]; [link]1 Chron. 28:11-19[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 3:10-12[/link]; [link]Eph. 2:20a[/link] and note 2.</note>
        <note num="2">The numbers three and five, seen here as components of the ark's dimensions, are basic numbers of God's building (cf. [link]Exo. 27[/link]). The number three signifies the Triune God in His dispensing of Himself into man ([link]Matt. 28:19[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 13:14[/link]; [link]Eph. 3:16-19[/link]). The number five is composed of four, signifying man as one of God's creatures ([link]Rev. 4:6-7[/link] and note [link]6[sup]2[/sup][/link]), plus one, signifying the one unique God ([link]Deut. 6:4[/link]; [link]Isa. 45:5[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 8:4[/link]). The significance of the numbers three and five is the mingling of the Triune God with man. This is God's building.[br][br]The dimensions of the ark are composed of three and five multiplied by either ten or one hundred. The number ten signifies completeness ([link]Dan. 1:12[/link], [link]20[/link]) and the number one hundred signifies fullness ([link]Matt. 13:23[/link]). This signifies that God's building is the mingling of the Triune God with man in completeness and fullness.</note>

        <note num="1">The raven is an unclean bird ([link]Lev. 11:15[/link]) because it feeds on carcasses, i.e., on death.

The dove ([link]v. 8[/link]) is a clean bird because it feeds on seeds, i.e., on life. The dove signifies the spiritual believers who remain in the church life and care for life in the Spirit.</note>

Christ was resurrected on the first day of the week, i.e., the eighth day of the old week (see note [link]1[sup]1[/sup] in John 20[/link]); thus, the number eight signifies resurrection. Since all the believers, the components of the church, were included in Christ's resurrection ([link]Eph. 2:6[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 1:3[/link]), they are the resurrected people. Hence, the living of Noah and his family after the flood signifies the living of the church in Christ's resurrection. This is a seed of the church life.[br][br]Eight persons were in the ark when it passed through the flood and when it came to rest on the mountain. Thus, whatever the ark experienced, they also experienced by being in the ark. This illustrates how the believers, by being in Christ ([link]1 Cor. 1:30[/link]; [link]Eph. 1:4[/link]), were crucified with Christ ([link]Rom. 6:6[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 5:14[/link]; [link]Gal. 2:20a[/link]) and also resurrected with Christ ([link]Eph. 2:6[/link]; [link]Col. 2:12[/link]; [link]3:1[/link]).

The failure of a leader in God's government is always a test to us.

[link]v. 31[/link]). Before God's initial appearing to Abraham, he and his family served other gods ([link]Josh. 24:2[/link]). It was out of such a dark background of idol worship, the background of Babel ([link]vv. 3-4[/link]), that God called Abraham, the father of faith ([link]Rom. 4:16[/link]; [link]Gal. 3:7[/link]). God's coming to Abraham and appearing to him brought light to Abraham (cf. [link]Matt. 4:16[/link]; [link]Acts 9:1-3[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 4:6[/link]) and motivated him to come out of the country of satanic idolatry. See note [link]2[sup]2[/sup] in Acts 7[/link] and note [link]2[sup]2[/sup] in Heb. 12[/link].[br][br]God came in to call Abraham that He might have a new beginning with fallen man. God's calling of Abraham was a transfer of race, a transfer from the created Adamic race to the called Abrahamic race (see note [link]16[sup]1[/sup] in Rom. 4[/link]). The transfer of race in God's calling is actually the transfer of life, from the life of Adam to the life of Christ ([link]Gal. 2:20[/link]; [link]Phil. 1:21a[/link]), from the fallen life of the old creation to the stronger and better life of the new creation &amp;#8212; the uncreated life of God. The process of this transfer of life is portrayed in the succeeding chapters of Genesis and is seen in the collective experiences of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</note>

After the death of Haran, Abraham's brother ([link]v. 28[/link]), God sovereignly caused his father, Terah, to bring the family from Ur to Haran.

        <note num="1">After the death of Abraham's father ([link]11:32[/link]), God appeared to Abraham and called him the second time (see note [link]31[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 11[/link]). God's repeated appearing to Abraham was a strong attraction to him, motivating and strengthening him to accept God's calling. It is the same with the New Testament believers (see notes [link book="Matt." chapter="4"]20[sup]1[/sup][/link] and [link]22[sup]1[/sup] in Matt. 4[/link], [link]9[sup]3[/sup] in Matt. 9[/link], [link]2[sup]2[/sup] in Heb. 12[/link], and [link]3[sup]8[/sup] in 2 Pet. 1[/link]).[br][br]The records of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (with Joseph &amp;#8212; see note [link]2[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 37[/link]) overlap. Genesis does not portray them as three separate individuals but as constituents of one corporate person. The experiences of these three men portray different aspects of one complete person's experience of the Triune God. "The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob" is Jehovah, the Triune God &amp;#8212; the Father, the Son, and the Spirit ([link]Exo. 3:15[/link]; [link]Matt. 28:19[/link]). The experience of Abraham signifies the experience of God the Father in His calling man, justifying man, and equipping man to live by faith and to live in fellowship with Him ([link]12:1[/link]; [link]15:6[/link]; [link]chs. 17-18[/link]; [link]19:29[/link]; [link]21:1-13[/link]; [link]22:1-18[/link]). The experience of Isaac signifies the experience of God the Son in His redeeming man ([link]22:1-14[/link]) and His blessing man with the inheritance of all His riches, with a life of the enjoyment of His abundance, and with a life in peace ([link]25:5[/link]; [link]26:3-4[/link], [link]12-33[/link]). The experience of Jacob (with Joseph) signifies the experience of God the Father in His loving man and choosing man ([link]Mal. 1:2[/link]; [link]Rom. 9:10-13[/link]) and of God the Spirit in His working all things for the good of His lovers, in His transforming man, and in His making man mature in the divine life that man may be able to bless all the people, to rule over all the earth, and to satisfy all the people with God the Son as the life supply ([link]27:41[/link]; [link]28:1-35:10[/link]; [link]chs. 37[/link], [link book="Gen."]39-49[/link]; [link]Rom. 8:28-29[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">When God appeared to Abraham, He also called him. God's speaking to Abraham was also a factor that motivated and strengthened him to accept God's calling (cf. [link]Rom. 1:6[/link]; [link]8:30[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 1:9[/link]). Cf. note [link]1[sup]1[/sup][/link], par. 1.</note>
        <note num="3">In His second appearing to Abraham, God called Abraham to come out not only from his country and his relatives but also from his father's house (cf. [link]Acts 7:3[/link]; see note [link book="Gen."]31[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 11[/link]). This means that God called only Abraham and his wife, Sarai. However, when Abraham left Haran, he took his nephew Lot with him ([link]vv. 4-5[/link]). This again shows Abraham's lack of absoluteness in accepting God's calling.</note>

Thus, in His preaching of the gospel to Abraham ([link]Gal. 3:8[/link]), God promised that He would give Himself to the called ones as a blessing. According to [link]22:18[/link], this blessing would come to all the nations through Abraham's seed, who is Christ ([link]Matt. 1:1[/link]; [link]Gal. 3:16[/link]).

Likewise, God's goal with the New Testament believers is not merely to save them from their fallen condition but to bring them into the reality of the good land, which is the all-inclusive Christ as the portion allotted by God to all the called ones ([link]Deut. 8:7-10[/link] and note [link]7[sup]1[/sup][/link]; [link]Col. 1:12[/link] and note 2).

        <note num="1">This was the third time God appeared to Abraham. Here God's reappearing confirmed to Abraham that he had answered God's calling and had arrived at the place where God intended him to be.

        <note num="2">Both the seed and the land typify Christ, who is the centrality and universality of God's eternal economy. See note [link]3[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 15[/link].[br][br]Christ, the incarnated God, is the threefold seed: the seed of woman ([link]3:15[/link]; [link]Isa. 7:14[/link]; [link]Gal. 4:4[/link]), the seed of Abraham ([link]12:7[/link]; [link]Matt. 1:1[/link]; [link]Gal. 3:16[/link]), and the seed of David ([link]2 Sam. 7:12-14[/link]; [link]Matt. 1:1[/link]; [link]22:42-45[/link]; [link]Rom. 1:3[/link]; [link]Rev. 22:16[/link]). As the seed of woman, the seed of Mary ([link]Matt. 1:16[/link]), Christ accomplished redemption to destroy Satan, the serpent, and to save the believers in Christ from sin and death ([link]Heb. 2:14[/link]; [link]Matt. 1:20-21[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 15:53-57[/link]). As the seed of Abraham, Christ became the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit ([link]1 Cor. 15:45[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 3:17[/link]) that the believers in Christ, who are Abraham's seed ([link]Gal. 3:29[/link]), may inherit the consummated Spirit, the consummation of the processed Triune God, as their divine inheritance, their spiritual blessing for eternity ([link]Acts 26:18[/link]; [link]Eph. 1:14a[/link]; [link]Gal. 3:14[/link]). As the seed of David, Christ brings His believers into the kingdom and causes them to share in His kingship in His resurrection in the eternal kingdom of God ([link]2 Tim. 2:12[/link]; [link]Rev. 20:4[/link], [link]6[/link]; [link]22:5b[/link]). The revelation of Christ as the threefold seed is the contents of the full gospel.</note>
        <note num="3">This was the first altar that Abraham built. An altar is for worshipping God by offering all that we are and have to God for His purpose. Abraham's building of an altar was motivated by God's reappearing and can be considered an anti-testimony to the building of the tower of Babel.</note>

        <note num="1">For the fulfillment of God's purpose two things are required: the seed ([link]vv. 1-6[/link]) and the land ([link]vv. 7-21[/link]). The seed is first the individual Christ ([link]Gal. 3:16[/link] and note) and then the corporate Christ ([link]1 Cor. 12:12[/link]), composed of Christ as the Head and all His believers ([link]Gal. 3:29[/link] and note 1, par. 1) as the Body. The land is Christ as the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit, in whom the believers live ([link]Deut. 8:7-10[/link] and note [link]7[sup]1[/sup][/link]); it is also the church as the enlargement, the expansion, of Christ. In order to fulfill God's purpose, we need to receive God's grace so that Christ can be wrought into us as the seed and lived out of us as the land to be our church life, that we may enjoy God's rest, defeat God's enemies, and establish God's kingdom with His habitation for His expression and representation.</note>

In order to strengthen Abraham's faith, God was compelled to confirm His promise to Abraham concerning the land by making a covenant with him ([link]vv. 9-21[/link]). The extraordinary way in which God enacted this covenant implies the way in which Abraham could fulfill God's eternal purpose.[br][br]The covenant God made with Abraham was a covenant of promise that would be fulfilled through God's power in His grace, not through Abraham's effort in his flesh. The new testament is a continuation of this covenant ([link]Gal. 3:17[/link] and note 1; [link]Gal. 4:22-26[/link] and note [link]24[sup]2[/sup][/link]).</note>

        <text>And He said to him, Bring Me a three-year-old [note]1[/note]heifer and a three-year-old female goat and a three-year-old ram and a turtledove and a young pigeon.</text>
        <note num="1">God made His covenant with Abraham through the crucified and resurrected Christ. The three kinds of slain cattle here signify Christ in His humanity being crucified for us, and the two living birds signify Christ in His divinity being the living, resurrected One ([link]John 11:25[/link]; [link]Rev. 1:18[/link]). Christ was killed in His humanity, but He lives in His divinity ([link]John 14:19[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 3:18[/link] and note 3).[br][br]The heifer was for a peace offering ([link]Lev. 3:1[/link]), the female goat was for a sin offering ([link]Lev. 4:28[/link]; [link]5:6[/link]), and the ram was for a burnt offering ([link]Lev. 1:10[/link]). That they were all three years old signifies that Christ was offered to God and was crucified in resurrection ([link]John 2:19[/link]; [link]11:25[/link]; [link]Heb. 9:14[/link]).[br][br]In typology, the turtledove signifies a suffering life, and the young pigeon signifies a believing life, a life of faith. These are two characteristics of the Lord's life on the earth. Since two is the number of testimony ([link]Matt. 18:16[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 13:1[/link]), the two living birds bear testimony of Christ as the resurrected One living in us and for us ([link]John 14:19-20[/link]; [link]Gal. 2:20[/link]).[br][br]Five is the number of responsibility (see note [link]2[sup]1[/sup] in Matt. 25[/link]). Hence, the fact that there were three cattle and two birds, making a total of five items, signifies that Christ as the crucified and living One is now bearing all the responsibility for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose.</note>

        <note num="1">God's asking Abraham to offer the cattle and the birds to Him implies that Abraham had to identify himself with and be one with all the things that he offered (see notes [link]21[sup]2[/sup] in ch. 3[/link] and [link]4[sup]1[/sup] in Lev. 1[/link]). This indicates that in order to fulfill God's eternal purpose, we must be crucified in Christ's crucifixion and resurrected in Christ's resurrection ([link]Rom. 6:5[/link], [link]8[/link]; [link]Gal. 2:20[/link]). Only in this way can we practice the church life in Christ as the promised land.</note>

        <note num="1">Abraham's producing of Ishmael by the exercise of his natural strength was a serious offense against God and His economy.

        <note num="1">The spiritual meaning of circumcision is to put off the flesh, to put off the self and the old man, through the crucifixion of Christ ([link]Col. 2:11[/link], [link]13a[/link]; [link]Deut. 10:16[/link]; [link]Jer. 4:4a[/link]; [link]Acts 7:51[/link]; [link]Gal. 5:24[/link]; [link]Rom. 6:6[/link]; [link]Eph. 4:22[/link]; [link]Col. 3:9[/link]). In [link]ch. 16[/link] Abraham exercised his flesh to produce Ishmael. Here God asked him to cut off his flesh, to terminate his natural strength, so that God could come in and bring forth Isaac by His grace for the fulfillment of His purpose. The circumcision in the Old Testament is the equivalent of baptism in the New Testament ([link]Col. 2:11-12[/link] and notes). The real circumcision is not outward in the flesh but inward "of the heart, in spirit, not in letter" ([link]Rom. 2:28-29[/link]). See note [link]2[sup]1[/sup] in Josh. 5[/link].</note>

        <note num="1">Although God's promise concerning the inheriting of the good land by His elect ([link]12:1-2[/link], [link]7[/link]; [link]13:15-17[/link]) had been made a covenant ([link]15:4-5[/link], [link]18-21[/link]), there was still the need to confirm the covenant of God's promise with the covenant of circumcision. Circumcision was the procedure that God's elect had to pass through in order to inherit God's promise. It signifies that God's chosen ones in the New Testament must be terminated through the cross so that they may inherit all the riches in Christ promised by God (cf. [link]Gal. 2:20[/link]). See [link]Rom. 4:11[/link] and note 1.</note>

        <note num="1">In figure the eighth day, the first day of a new week, refers to Christ's resurrection ([link]Matt. 28:1[/link]; [link]John 20:1[/link]). Circumcision must be in resurrection, and it always ushers us into resurrection ([link]Col. 2:12[/link]; cf. [link]Rom. 6:3-5[/link]), making us a new person, a new creation ([link]2 Cor. 5:17[/link]; [link]Gal. 6:15[/link]), for the fulfillment of God's purpose.[br][br]Circumcision corresponds to the changing of human names ([link]v. 5[/link]).

        <note num="2">Meaning princess. The word my before princess (see note [link]15[sup]1[/sup][/link]) indicates narrowness and particularity. Here, the changing of Sarah's name signifies generality and suggests the enlarging and broadening of her person to make her a mother of nations ([link]v. 16[/link]). As seen with both Abraham ([link]v. 5[/link]) and Sarah, such a change requires the termination of our old and natural man so that we may be transformed into a new person who can produce seed and care for others for the fulfillment of God's purpose.</note>

God's covenant of circumcision in this chapter corresponds to the new covenant, in which Christ's death cuts off our old man in the flesh and Christ's resurrection germinates our new man, signified by Isaac, to make us the new creation ([link]2 Cor. 5:17[/link]).</note>

In principle, to use any kind of sinful or worldly methods to secure increase for our success in the Christian work is to break God's governing principle and thus to commit spiritual incest (cf. [link]Matt. 7:21-23[/link]). The seed produced by incest became a great damage to the people of God through fornication ([link]Num. 25:1-5[/link]; [link]Rev. 2:14[/link] and notes 2 and 3).</note>

        <note num="1">Abraham's offering of his beloved and only son, Isaac, on the altar is a vivid picture of God the Father's offering of His beloved and only Son, Jesus Christ, on the cross. In this picture Isaac typifies Christ in a detailed way. Isaac, as Abraham's only son ([link]vv. 2[/link], [link]12[/link], [link]16[/link]), typifies Christ as God's only begotten Son ([link]John 3:16[/link]). Isaac was Abraham's beloved son ([link]v. 2[/link]), and Christ was the Father's beloved Son, in whom He delighted ([link]Matt. 3:17[/link]). Isaac took his father's will ([link]v. 6[/link]), and Christ also chose the will of His Father ([link]Matt. 26:39[/link]). Isaac was obedient unto death ([link]vv. 9-10[/link]); likewise, Christ was obedient unto death ([link]Phil. 2:8[/link]). Isaac carried the wood for the burnt offering and walked to the top of Mount Moriah ([link]v. 6[/link]); in the same way, Christ bore His cross and walked to Golgotha ([link]John 19:17[/link]). Isaac was offered to God as a burnt offering on Mount Moriah; Christ also was offered to God on the same mountain (see note [link]1[sup]1[/sup] in Mark 10[/link]) to fulfill the type of the burnt offering. Isaac was "killed" on the altar and was returned to Abraham on the third day, that is, in resurrection ([link]vv. 4[/link], [link]10-13[/link]; [link]Heb. 11:19[/link]); similarly, Christ was crucified on the cross and was resurrected on the third day ([link]1 Cor. 15:4[/link]). Isaac was multiplied in resurrection ([link]v. 17[/link]), and Christ also was multiplied in His resurrection ([link]John 12:24[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 1:3[/link]). Isaac was the seed of Abraham for the blessing of all the nations ([link]v. 18[/link]); likewise, Christ is the unique seed of Abraham in whom the blessing of Abraham has come to the nations ([link]Gal. 3:8[/link], [link]14[/link], [link]16[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">Meaning [i]the vision of Jah.[/i] Mount Moriah, the place of God's choice, eventually became Mount Zion, the site for the temple (cf. [link]2 Chron. 3:1[/link]) and the center of the good land. Abraham was the first to worship God with the burnt offering on Mount Zion. Later, Abraham's descendants, the children of Israel, were commanded by God to go three times a year to this place to worship God and there to offer to Him their burnt offerings ([link]Deut. 16:16[/link]; [link]Psa. 132:13[/link]). Today, the New Testament believers, Abraham's spiritual descendants, are on Mount Zion ([link]Heb. 12:22-23[/link]). Eventually, we all will join Abraham to worship God on the eternal Mount Zion, the New Jerusalem ([link]Rev. 21:22[/link]).</note>
        <note num="3">Isaac, a type of Christ as the promised seed ([link]Gal. 3:16[/link]), was given to Abraham by God. Here God asked Abraham to give back to God what God had given him. This surely was a test to Abraham ([link]v. 1[/link]; [link]Heb. 11:17[/link]). This shows a basic principle in God's economy: all that God has given us, even what He has wrought in us and through us, must eventually be offered back to Him, that we may live a life of faith, not holding on to anything, even to the things given by God, but relying only on Him. After Isaac was offered, he was returned to Abraham in resurrection and became a blessing ([link]vv. 12-13[/link], [link]16[/link], [link]18[/link]; [link]Heb. 11:19[/link]). Likewise, after we have offered to God what we have received of Him, He will return it to us in resurrection and it will become a blessing for the fulfillment of His purpose.

The sand on the seashore is the dust beside the sea. This sand is separated from the sea and also washed by the waves of the sea. The sea signifies the Gentile nations ([link]Isa. 57:20[/link]; [link]Rev. 17:15[/link]). The Gentile nations used by God to chastise Israel throughout the centuries ([link]Joel 1:4[/link] and note) were like the waves from the Mediterranean, coming up again and again with their invading armies to wash Israel as the dust to produce a remnant who are like the sand on the seashore ([link]Zech. 12-14[/link]; [link]Rom. 9:27-29[/link]).

The Angel of Jehovah, who is Christ, provided the ram, a type of Christ, which eventually issued in the seed, who is also Christ.</note>

He was more concerned for the future than for the present.

The names Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are the components of the divine title of God, who is the God of resurrection ([link]Exo. 3:15[/link]; [link]Matt. 22:32[/link] and note).</note>
        <note num="2">Although Abraham, Sarah, and Isaac were living at Beer-sheba ([link]21:33[/link]), Sarah died and was buried in Hebron, the place of fellowship with God. Hebron is between Beer-sheba on the south and Jerusalem on the north. Thus, Hebron was not only a place of fellowship but also a way that led to Jerusalem. In spiritual significance, the cave of Machpelah in Hebron ([link]v. 19[/link]), in which Sarah was buried, is the gateway to the New Jerusalem.[br][br]The cave of Machpelah was at the end of a field, in which were many trees ([link]v. 17[/link]). A field is a place where life grows; thus, it implies resurrection. Abraham did not bury Sarah in a place of death but in a place of life, a place full of resurrection ([link]1 Cor. 15:36[/link] and note). This indicates that Abraham believed in the God of resurrection ([link]Rom. 4:17[/link]) and was filled with the expectation that his wife would be resurrected and would be in the city which has the foundations, the New Jerusalem. According to Abraham's realization, Sarah's death was not a termination but an entering into the gate of resurrection, the gateway into the expected city and the better country ([link]Heb. 11:10[/link], [link]16[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">This chapter primarily reveals the practical living of God's people in oneness with God for the accomplishing of His eternal purpose. The marriage of Isaac was not merely for his human living; it was altogether for the producing of a people, the seed of Abraham, for the fulfillment of God's purpose ([link]22:17[/link]). Thus, in the gaining of a wife for Isaac, everything was done according to God's economy to bring forth Christ for the producing of the kingdom of God.[br][br]This chapter also presents a rich type of the marriage of Christ, typified by Isaac, and the church, typified by Rebekah.</note>
        <note num="2">In this account of the marriage of Isaac, Abraham typifies God the Father, the servant typifies God the Spirit, Isaac typifies God the Son, and Rebekah typifies the chosen people of God, who will marry the Son and become His counterpart. The entire New Testament is a record of the Triune God working together to gain a part of the human race to be the bride, the counterpart, of the Son ([link]John 3:29[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 11:2[/link]; [link]Eph. 5:25-32[/link]; [link]Rev. 19:7-9[/link]; [link]21:2[/link], [link]9-10[/link]). In eternity past God the Father had an eternal purpose and made an eternal plan to gain the church as a bride for His Son out of the human race ([link]Eph. 3:8-11[/link]). Then, in time, God the Father commissioned God the Spirit to carry out His plan by going to contact the chosen bride and bring her to God the Son to be His counterpart, His wife.</note>

        <note num="1">There is no record that God told Abraham not to take a wife for his son from among the Canaanite women (cf. [link]Deut. 7:1-4[/link]). Because Abraham lived in oneness with God ([link]v. 40a[/link]), he knew God's will and mind and acted in accordance with God's inner feeling (cf. [link]1 Cor. 7:25[/link] and note; [link]2 Cor. 2:10[/link] and note 3; [link]Phil. 1:8[/link] and note).</note>

        <note num="1">In typology, the fact that Isaac's bride was taken from Abraham's relatives indicates that the counterpart of Christ must come from Christ's race, not from the angels or from any other creatures ([link]2:18-23[/link] and notes). Since Christ was incarnated to be a man ([link]Heb. 2:14a[/link]), humanity has become His race.</note>

        <note num="1">These gifts, sent from Isaac and given by the servant of Abraham, the father, signify the riches of Christ given by the Spirit of God to the bride for the accomplishing of God's purpose. These gifts relate to the function of the believers. Gold signifies the divine nature, and a ring signifies the initial gift of the Spirit ([link]Acts 2:38[/link]), which is the Spirit Himself as a seal and a pledge, a foretaste of God as our eternal portion ([link]Eph. 1:13-14[/link]; cf. [link]Luke 15:22[/link]). The function of the nose is to smell. The putting of the nose-ring upon Rebekah's nose ([link]v. 47[/link]) signifies, spiritually, that her "smelling" function had been caught by the divine nature (cf. [link]2 Cor. 2:14-16[/link]; [link]Heb. 6:4-6[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 2:2-3[/link]; [link]2 Pet. 1:4[/link]). Hands are for working (see note [link]8[sup]3[/sup] in 1 Tim. 2[/link]). The putting of the bracelets on Rebekah's hands signifies the receiving of the divine function for the service in the Body of Christ ([link]Rom. 12:4[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">The half shekel signifies the first taste, the foretaste, of the Spirit, which guarantees that the full taste is coming ([link]Rom. 8:23[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 1:22[/link]; [link]Eph. 1:13-14[/link]). The ten shekels, ten signifying fullness, or completeness (e.g., the Ten Commandments, which express God's demand in full), indicate that the divine function we have received of the Spirit is complete, not partial ([link]1 Cor. 12:4-11[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">The gold nose-ring and bracelets ([link]v. 22[/link]), the silver and gold jewelry, and the clothing given to Rebekah, along with the precious things given to her brother and her mother, symbolize the unsearchable riches of Christ ([link]Eph. 3:8[/link]). The servant testified to Rebekah concerning Isaac's riches, which he inherited from his father ([link]vv. 35-36[/link]), and gave some of these riches to Rebekah as a foretaste. This caused Rebekah to be attracted to Isaac and made her willing to leave her father's house to be his wife ([link]v. 58[/link]) even though she had never seen him. In the same manner the Spirit comes to Christ's believers and testifies to them of the riches of Christ, which He has received from the Father ([link]John 16:13-15[/link]), causing them to be attracted to Christ and to love Him, to forsake the world, and to leave their natural relations in the flesh to be joined to Christ ([link]Matt. 19:29[/link]), even though they have never seen Him ([link]1 Pet. 1:8[/link]). Before Rebekah met Isaac in the good land, she had participated in and enjoyed Isaac's inheritance through the servant's gifts. Likewise, before we meet Christ, we enjoy the gifts of the Spirit as a foretaste of the full taste of His riches ([link]Heb. 6:4[/link]; [link]Rom. 8:23[/link]).</note>

Furthermore, at the end of his days Abraham did not bless anyone, in contrast to Isaac and Jacob ([link]27:27-29[/link]; [link]48:13-20[/link]; [link]49:1-28[/link]; cf.

Abraham's life reveals that if we would enjoy God's grace and have the full enjoyment of God's riches, we must suffer loss and have our natural life circumcised, cut off. Isaac's life reveals that our suffering to terminate our natural life is for the enjoyment of God's grace. Throughout his entire life Isaac did nothing but enjoy God's rich blessing ([link]v. 11[/link]; [link]26:24b[/link]), which points to the grace of the New Testament (see note [link]11[sup]1[/sup][/link]). Isaac was born in grace ([link]21:1-3[/link]; [link]Gal. 4:23[/link]), grew up in grace ([link]21:8[/link]), and was made an heir of grace ([link]v. 5[/link]).

        <note num="1">Even while he was still in his mother's womb Jacob was striving to be the firstborn. His desire to be the first corresponded with God's intention that he be the one who would receive the birthright. However, like his grandfather Abraham, Jacob exercised his natural ability and his natural strength to fulfill God's intention and satisfy his desire. Although God had chosen him to be the first, God sovereignly caused Jacob to be born the second so that he might learn that his natural man was altogether unworthy and had to be cut off. Since Jacob's natural man was not qualified, he needed to be transformed.[br][br]The record of Jacob's life occupies more than half of the book of Genesis. This long record shows us that the purpose of God in His selecting, predestinating, and calling is to transform sinners into royal sons of God who bear God's image to express Him and exercise God's dominion to represent Him (cf. [link]1:26[/link]). God destined Jacob to live a struggling life all his days. Furthermore, God sovereignly arranged every circumstance, situation, and person in Jacob's life and caused them all to work together for Jacob's good, so that He could transform Jacob, a supplanter and a heel holder, into Israel, a prince of God. In particular, God used Jacob's family, including his father, his mother, his brother, his uncle, and his wives and children, to deal with Jacob for his transformation. God's dealing with Jacob is a full picture of the Holy Spirit's discipline and His transforming work in the New Testament believers ([link]Rom. 8:28-29[/link]; [link]12:2[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 3:18[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">Although Isaac enjoyed God's unconditional grace, finding enjoyment and satisfaction (signified by a well) in every place that he went ([link]25:11[/link]; [link]26:15-22[/link]), Beer-sheba was the unique place in which he experienced God's appearing, received His promise, built an altar, called on the name of the Lord, and pitched a tent as a testimony. God's called ones are destined to enjoy God's grace regardless of their standing, but this enjoyment does not justify their standing. If we desire to have God's appearing, inherit His promises, and live a life for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose, we must come to the unique place that God has chosen and remain there. This unique place is signified by Beer-sheba, with the well for life supply and the tamarisk tree as the expression of the rich flow of life ([link]21:25[/link], [link]33[/link]).

        <note num="1">Jacob's dream is a most crucial point in this book, and [link]vv. 10-22[/link] unveil the most crucial matter in the revelation of God. God desires to have a house on earth, and His intention is to transform His called ones into stones, material for His building. In the account of Jacob's dream, the stone ([link]vv. 11[/link], [link]18[/link], [link]22[/link]), the pillar ([link]v. 18[/link]), the house of God ([link]vv. 17[/link], [link]19[/link], [link]22[/link]), and the oil ([link]v. 18[/link]) are outstanding items. The stone symbolizes Christ as the foundation stone, the top stone, and the cornerstone for God's building ([link]Isa. 28:16[/link]; [link]Zech. 4:7[/link]; [link]Acts 4:10-12[/link]). It also symbolizes the transformed man, who has been constituted with Christ as the transforming element to be the material for the building of God's house ([link]2:12[/link]; [link]Matt. 16:18[/link]; [link]John 1:42[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 3:12[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 2:5[/link]; [link]Rev. 21:11[/link], [link]18-20[/link]), which is the church today ([link]1 Tim. 3:15[/link]) and which will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the eternal dwelling place of God and His redeemed elect ([link]Rev. 21:3[/link], [link]22[/link]). In [link]v. 11[/link] a stone was used by Jacob for a pillow, signifying that the very divine element of Christ constituted into our being through our subjective experience of Him becomes a pillow for our rest (cf. [link]Matt. 11:28[/link]). After awaking from his dream, Jacob set up the pillow-stone as a pillar, signifying that the Christ who has been wrought into us and on whom we rest becomes the material and the support for God's building, God's house (cf. [link]1 Kings 7:21[/link]; [link]Gal. 2:9[/link]; [link]Rev. 3:12[/link]). Eventually, Jacob poured oil, a symbol of the Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God reaching man ([link]Exo. 30:23-30[/link]; [link]Luke 4:18[/link]), on the pillar, symbolizing that the transformed man is one with the Triune God and expresses Him. That stone became Bethel, the house of God ([link]vv. 19[/link], [link]22[/link]). God's house is the mutual dwelling place of God and His redeemed ([link]John 14:2[/link], [link]23[/link]) &amp;#8212; man as God's dwelling place ([link]Isa. 66:1-2[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 3:16[/link]; [link]Eph. 2:22[/link]; [link]Heb. 3:6[/link]; [link]Rev. 21:3[/link]) and God as man's dwelling place ([link]Psa. 90:1[/link]; [link]John 15:5[/link]; [link]Rev. 21:22[/link]). Hence, the house of God is constituted of God and man mingled together as one. In God's house God expresses Himself in humanity, and both God and man find mutual and eternal satisfaction and rest.</note>
        <note num="2">This ladder is the center, the focus, of Jacob's dream. This dream is a revelation of Christ, for Christ is the reality of the ladder that Jacob saw ([link]John 1:51[/link] and notes). Christ as the Son of Man, in His humanity, is the ladder that brings heaven (God) to earth (man) and joins earth and heaven as one (cf. [link]John 14:6[/link]). Our regenerated spirit, which is God's dwelling place today ([link]Eph. 2:22[/link]), is the base on earth where Christ as the heavenly ladder has been set up ([link]2 Tim. 4:22[/link]). Hence, whenever we turn to our spirit, we experience Christ as the ladder bringing God to us and us to God (see note [link]19[sup]1[/sup] in Heb. 10[/link]). Where this ladder is, there are an open heaven, the transformed man, the anointing upon this man, and the building up of the house of God with this man. The issue of Christ as the heavenly ladder is Bethel, the church, the Body of Christ, and the consummation of this ladder is the New Jerusalem.</note>

        <note num="1">God's referring to Himself as the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac implies that He would also become the God of Jacob. The God of Abraham is the God of justification, the God of Isaac is the God of grace, and the God of Jacob is the God of transformation through divine discipline. Eventually, the God of Jacob became the God of Israel ([link]33:20[/link]; [link]Exo. 5:1[/link]), the God of the transformed Jacob.</note>
        <note num="2">God promised Jacob that He would give him the seed, the land, and the blessing ([link]vv. 13-14[/link]), as He had promised Abraham ([link]12:3[/link], [link]7[/link]; [link]13:14-16[/link]; [link]15:18[/link]; [link]22:17-18[/link]) and Isaac ([link]26:3-4[/link]). The land is for the kingdom of God, and the seed is for the expression of God and for the spreading of God's image. Both the land and the seed are Christ (see note [link]3[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 15[/link]), who also becomes the blessing ([link]v. 14[/link]) with which we bless others ([link]Rom. 15:29[/link]).</note>

The three pillars set up by Jacob in [link]chs. 31[/link] and [link book="Gen."]35[/link] were three landmarks of Jacob's life. (The pillar set up in [link]28:18[/link] was in response to a dream and was not part of Jacob's spiritual experience; hence, it is not considered a landmark in his life. See note [link]14[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 35[/link].)

        <text>And God said to Jacob, Rise up, go up to [note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]Bethel, and dwell there; and make an [xref]b[/xref]altar there to the God who appeared to you when you [xref]c[/xref]fled from your brother Esau.</text>
        <note num="1">At Bethel Jacob had made a vow to God, promising that if God would preserve him and care for him, the stone which he set up for a pillar would be the house of God ([link]28:20-22[/link]). Here, God reminded Jacob to fulfill his part of that vow (cf. [link]31:13[/link]). On his return from Paddan-aram, Jacob came to Shechem in the land of Canaan, and he settled there ([link]33:18-20[/link]). However, this was short of God's goal. God's purpose according to His heart's desire is to have Bethel, His house on earth. Thus, it was necessary for Jacob to go on from Shechem to Bethel. All the unfortunate events in [link]ch. 34[/link] were sovereignly used by God to make it impossible for Jacob to remain in Shechem and to prepare Jacob to receive God's charge to go up to Bethel. Jacob's passing through Shechem and going up to Bethel signifies our passing through the individual Christian life and going up to the corporate church life for the building up of God's eternal dwelling place, which is the church today and the New Jerusalem in eternity.[br][br]Bethel is a great seed in the Bible, a seed of the house of God. When Israel, the transformed Jacob, was multiplied into the house of Israel, in God's eyes the house of Israel was the house of God (see note [link]6[sup]1[/sup] in Heb. 3[/link]). Eventually, the tabernacle and later the temple were built as symbols of the house of Israel as God's dwelling place on the earth in the Old Testament time. In the beginning of the New Testament the Lord Jesus came through incarnation to be the reality of the tabernacle and the temple ([link]John 1:14[/link]; [link]2:18-21[/link]). Then, in [link]Matt. 16:18[/link] the Lord prophesied that He would build the church as the habitation, the temple, of God ([link]Eph. 2:22[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 3:16-17[/link]) on Himself as the rock and with His believers as stones ([link]1 Cor. 3:11[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 2:5[/link]). This is Bethel, the house of God ([link]1 Tim. 3:15[/link]). Ultimately, this Bethel will be enlarged to consummate in the New Jerusalem, the eternal tabernacle of God, in which God Himself and the Lamb will be the temple ([link]Rev. 21:3[/link], [link]22[/link]).

For the realizing of Bethel, the old man with his old manner of life, signified by the old garments ([link]Isa. 64:6[/link]), must also be put off, and the new man with his new manner of life, the church life, must be put on ([link]Eph. 4:22-24[/link]).</note>

The church is altogether a new man ([link]Eph. 2:15[/link]), and the church life is the new life of the transformed Israel ([link]Gal. 6:16[/link]), which life is God in Christ.</note>

        <note num="1">This was a repetition of what Jacob had done in [link]28:18[/link]. There Bethel, the house of God, was only a dream; it was not yet Jacob's experience. Here Jacob set up a second pillar at Bethel to consecrate himself to God for the fulfillment of the dream and of his vow to God in [link]28:10-22[/link].

Its being mentioned here in connection with the pillar at Bethel indicates that the drink offering is for God's building. The fact that Jacob poured a drink offering upon the pillar before pouring oil upon it signifies that the pouring out of the drink offering brings in the outpouring of the Spirit ([link]Acts 2:33[/link]) for the sanctifying of God's house ([link]Exo. 40:9[/link]).</note>

This was a deep and personal dealing for Jacob. Jacob lost Rachel, but in the process he gained Benjamin, who was a type of Christ. "Rachel" had to die so that "Benjamin" could be born. In the same manner, God will eventually take away our natural choice so that we may bring forth Christ for His expression. God's goal is not to make His chosen ones suffer loss; it is to bring forth Christ through them.</note>

See note [link]27[sup]1[/sup] in Psa. 68[/link].[br][br]Benjamin and Joseph, the two sons born to Jacob by Rachel, are both types of Christ. Although Joseph was born first, in typology he is the continuation of Benjamin, for the record of Joseph's life ([link]chs. 37-50[/link]) follows the record of Benjamin's birth. Joseph, like Benjamin, typifies the suffering and exalted Christ. During the first part of his life Joseph suffered as the son of affliction, and during the second part he was exalted to the throne at the right hand of Pharaoh ([link]41:40-44[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">At this point Jacob was a transformed person, but he was not yet mature. To be transformed is to be metabolically changed in our natural life ([link]Rom. 12:2[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 3:18[/link]); to be mature is to be filled with the divine life that changes us. We may be changed in our natural life (transformed) yet not be filled with the divine life (mature). The last stage of transformation is maturity. Jacob's transformation began at the time God touched him ([link]32:25[/link]), and it continued until the end of [link]ch. 36[/link], when the process of transformation was relatively complete (see note [link]3[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 37[/link]). [link]Genesis 37:1-43:14[/link] is a record of the process of Jacob's maturity.[br][br]Genesis shows a complete picture of how human beings can be remade and transformed to express God in His image and represent God with His dominion. This book ends as it begins &amp;#8212; with God's image and dominion. The last fourteen chapters indicate that after Jacob had become Israel, he bore the image of God and, through Joseph, exercised the dominion of God. For God's expression and dominion there is the need of maturity. Only a mature life can bear God's image and exercise His dominion.</note>

        <text>These are the generations of Jacob.[separator][note]1[/note]Joseph, when he was seventeen years old, was [note]2[/note]shepherding the flock with his brothers while he was [i]still[/i] a youth, with the sons of Bilhah and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives. And Joseph brought an evil report of them to their father.</text>
        <note num="1">In the last fourteen chapters of Genesis the biographies of Jacob and Joseph are blended, indicating that according to spiritual experience, Jacob and Joseph are one person (cf. note [link]1[sup]1[/sup], par. 2, in ch. 12[/link] and note [link]1[sup]1[/sup], par. 2, in ch. 25[/link]). Joseph is a type of Christ as the One who is altogether perfect, having no defects ([link]Luke 23:4[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 5:21[/link]; [link]Heb. 4:15[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 2:22[/link]). As such, Joseph represents the reigning aspect of the mature Israel, the constitution of Christ in Jacob's mature nature. As a mature saint constituted of Christ, the perfect One, Jacob reigned through Joseph ([link]41:39-44[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">Joseph, like Abel, was a shepherd. This signifies the aspect of the constitution of Christ in the mature life that is the shepherding life to care for others ([link]John 10:11[/link]; [link]21:15-17[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">Jacob's preferential love for Joseph indicates that he was not fully transformed but was still living somewhat in the natural life. Jacob's partiality toward Joseph caused him further sufferings, which deeply touched his personal feelings. These final dealings brought him to full maturity for the expression and dominion of God.</note>

        <note num="1">Joseph's two dreams ([link]vv. 7-9[/link]), both from God, unveiled to him God's divine view concerning the nature, position, function, and goal of God's people on earth. According to their fallen nature, God's people are evil and unclean, but in God's eternal view, His people are sheaves of wheat full of life and heavenly bodies full of light (cf. [link]Num. 23:21[/link]; [link]1 Kings 19:18[/link]; [link]Rev. 12:1[/link] and note). The reigning aspect of the mature life never condemns God's people (cf. [link]v. 2c[/link]). Rather, it shepherds and appreciates them. Joseph's dreams controlled and directed his behavior (cf. [link]Acts 26:19[/link]).

        <note num="1">In his receiving glory and gifts in his enthronement, Joseph typifies Christ, who received glory ([link]Heb. 2:9[/link]) and gifts ([link]Psa. 68:18[/link]; [link]Acts 2:33[/link]) in His ascension. The ring, the garments, and the gold chain portray the gifts that Christ received in His ascension to the heavens, which gifts He has passed on to the church. The signet ring signifies the Holy Spirit as a seal within and upon Christ's believers ([link]Acts 2:33[/link]; [link]Eph. 1:13[/link]; [link]4:30[/link]; cf. [link]Luke 15:22[/link]). The garments signify Christ as our objective righteousness for our justification before God ([link]1 Cor. 1:30[/link]; cf. [link]Psa. 45:9[/link], [link]13[/link]; [link]Luke 15:22[/link]) and as our subjective righteousness lived out of us that we may be qualified to participate in the marriage of the Lamb ([link]Psa. 45:14[/link] and note 1; [link]Rev. 19:7-9[/link] and note [link]8[sup]2[/sup][/link]). The golden chain signifies the beauty of the Holy Spirit given for obedience expressed in submission (cf. [link]Acts 5:32[/link]). A chained neck signifies a will that has been conquered and subdued to obey God's commandment (cf. [link]S.S. 1:10[/link]; [link]Prov. 1:8-9[/link]). According to the sequence of spiritual experience, we first receive the sealing Spirit for salvation; then we receive the garment of righteousness and begin to live Christ ([link]Gal. 2:20[/link]; [link]Phil. 1:20-21a[/link]). In order for us to live Christ, our neck must be chained, our will must be subdued, by the Holy Spirit.</note>

        <note num="1">The account of the relationship between Joseph and his brothers in [link]chs. 42-45[/link] is a detailed portrait of the relationship between Christ and the nation of Israel: (1) Just as Joseph's brothers were forced to turn to him for food ([link]vv. 1-5[/link]; [link]43:1-15[/link]), the children of Israel will be forced to turn to Christ to preserve their existence ([link]Zech. 12:10[/link]; [link]Rom. 11:26[/link]). (2) Just as Joseph's brothers were ignorant of him ([link]vv. 8[/link], [link]28[/link]; [link]43:32-34[/link]; [link]44:14-34[/link]), so the people of Israel are ignorant of who Christ is today. (3) Just as Joseph tested and disciplined his brothers after they were forced to turn to him ([link]vv. 15-24[/link]; [link]44:1-13[/link]), so Christ will test and discipline Israel when they are in the process of turning to Him ([link]Zech. 13:8-9[/link]). (4) While Joseph was disciplining his brothers, he loved them and cared for them in a secret way ([link]v. 25[/link]; [link]43:16[/link], [link]25-34[/link]); similarly, at the end time Christ will secretly show His love toward Israel and provide for their needs (cf. [link]Rev. 7:2-8[/link]). (5) Just as Joseph eventually acknowledged his ignorant brothers ([link]45:1-4[/link], [link]14-16[/link]), Christ will acknowledge the ignorant nation of Israel ([link]Rom. 11:26[/link]). (6) Just as Joseph's brothers eventually recognized him ([link]45:15[/link]), the Israelites will eventually recognize Christ ([link]Zech. 12:10[/link]). (7) Just as Joseph revealed himself in his exaltation and glory to his brothers ([link]45:1[/link], [link]8[/link], [link]13[/link]), Christ will reveal Himself in His exaltation and glory to the remnant of Israel ([link]Micah 5:3-4[/link]; [link]Matt. 24:30[/link]). (8) Joseph's brothers participated in the enjoyment of his reign, and Joseph took special care of them as God's testimony on earth ([link]45:16-24[/link]; [link]47:11-12[/link]; [link]50:21[/link]); likewise, in the millennium Israel will participate in the enjoyment of Christ's reign, and Christ will care in a special way for Israel as God's testimony among the nations ([link]Isa. 2:2-3[/link]; [link]61:6[/link]; [link]Zech. 8:23[/link]; [link]14:16-19[/link]).</note>

He dealt with his brothers soberly, wisely, and with discernment, disciplining them according to their need in order to perfect them and build them up that they might be a collective people living together as God's testimony on earth (cf.

Jacob's supplanting hands became blessing hands ([link]48:14-16[/link]). Maturity in life is a matter of being filled with God as life, and blessing is the overflow of life, the overflow of God through the maturity in life. To bless others is to bring them into the presence of God and to bring God into them as grace, love, and fellowship that they may enjoy the Triune God &amp;#8212; the Father, the Son, and the Spirit ([link]14:18-19[/link]; [link]Num. 6:23-27[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 13:14[/link]).

In order to receive food from Joseph, the people had to pay four kinds of prices: their money, their livestock, their land, and themselves ([link]vv. 14-23[/link]). Money represents convenience, livestock signifies the means of living, and land represents resources. If we would receive the life supply from the Lord, we must give Him our convenience, our means of livelihood, and our resources. The more we give Him, the more life supply we will receive from Him. Ultimately, in order to receive the best portion from the Lord, including food for satisfaction and seed for reproduction ([link]v. 23[/link]), we must hand ourselves, every part of our being, over to Him.[br][br]Eventually, there was only one landlord in Egypt, and all the people became enjoyers on the same level.

However, as he was departing this life, Jacob could no longer do anything for himself; he could only lie on his bed. His natural strength having been fully terminated, he could trust only in God's grace, represented here by Joseph, a type of Christ. It was not by Jacob's strength but by the hand of Joseph that Jacob was finally brought to the good land for his actual inheritance ([link]50:5-13[/link]).

        <text>And now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are [note]1[/note]mine; [xref]a[/xref]Ephraim and Manasseh will be mine, as Reuben and Simeon are.</text>
        <note num="1">Jacob made the two sons of Joseph, who was born of Rachel, his first two sons to replace Reuben and Simeon, who were born of Leah. In blessing Ephraim and Manasseh, Jacob gave Joseph a double portion of the land ([link]Josh. 16-17[/link]). Thus, the birthright among Jacob's sons was shifted from Reuben to Joseph through Jacob's desire to remember Rachel ([link]v. 7[/link]). God honored what Jacob did and made it a fact by the allotting of the land at the time the children of Israel entered the good land. See note [link]2[sup]3[/sup] in Matt. 1[/link].[br][br]In Genesis there are four cases of the shifting of the birthright. The shifting of the birthright from Esau to Jacob ([link]25:22-26[/link], [link]29-34[/link]) reveals that receiving the birthright does not depend on our natural birth but on God's predestination ([link]Rom. 9:10-13[/link]). The shifting of the birthright from Zarah to Pharez ([link]38:27-30[/link]) illustrates the fact that the granting of the birthright does not depend on man's doing but on God's choosing. The shifting of the birthright from Reuben to Joseph ([link]49:3-4[/link]; [link]1 Chron. 5:1-2[/link]) reveals that, although we may be predestinated to have the birthright, we can lose it by indulging in fornication. The shifting of the birthright from Manasseh to Ephraim ([link]vv. 12-20[/link]) shows that the Lord's blessing does not depend on man's natural maneuvering but on God's desire and selection. The last case of the shifting of the birthright in the Scriptures is the shifting of the birthright from Israel to the church (see note [link]31[sup]1[/sup] in Matt. 21[/link]).</note>

When a lion goes after some prey, he descends from his dwelling place on the mountain, and after he takes the prey, he brings it up the mountain with him to devour it.

[link]Rev. 3:5[/link]), but he will still be a tribe in the millennium because of his father's blessing ([link]Ezek. 48:1[/link]). See note [link]6[sup]1[/sup], par. 2, in Rev. 7[/link].</note>

        <text>Dan will be a [note]1[/note]serpent in the way, / A viper on the path, / That bites the horse's heels, / So that his rider falls backward.</text>
        <note num="1">In [link]Deut. 33:22[/link] Dan is likened to a young lion leaping from Bashan. As a young lion, Dan fought in order to gain more land ([link]Josh. 19:47[/link]; [link]Judg. 18:27-29[/link]), the land signifying Christ (see note [link]7[sup]1[/sup] in Deut. 8[/link]). After his success in his victory Dan became a serpent, a viper, acting individualistically and independently in his pride to set up an idol and a divisive center of worship and to ordain a hired priest in the city of Dan during the time that the house of God was in Shiloh ([link]Judg. 18:30-31[/link]; cf. [link]Deut. 12:5[/link] and note). As a serpent Dan bit the horse's heels so that its rider fell backward, signifying that the apostasy brought in by Dan became a great stumbling block to the nation of Israel. Throughout the history of the church many spiritual people have followed Dan's example, thereby frustrating God's people from going on in His ordained way. A further fulfillment of Jacob's prophecy concerning Dan is seen in [link]1 Kings 12:26-31[/link] (see notes there).</note>

According to [link]Deut. 33:20-21[/link], Gad was enlarged because of his victory; he provided the first part of the good land (the land east of the Jordan) for himself, but before enjoying his portion, he went with his brothers and fought with them to gain their portion of the land west of the Jordan ([link]Num. 32:1-32[/link]), thus executing Jehovah's righteousness and His judgments in Israel. Dan's failure was because he was individualistic and cared only for himself, whereas Gad's success was because he was corporate and took care of the need of his brothers. In New Testament terms, to follow Gad's example we need to have the corporate sense of the Body and care for the members of the Body for the accomplishing of God's will, which is to have the Body life ([link]Rom. 12:1-21[/link]).</note>

        <note num="2">Moses' blessing in [link]Deut. 33:12[/link] says that Benjamin will dwell securely beside Jehovah and that Jehovah will dwell between Benjamin's shoulders. Jerusalem with God's temple, God's dwelling place, was located in the territory of Benjamin ([link]Judg. 1:21[/link]). Thus, the blessing of Jacob's twelve sons ends with God's dwelling place, which ultimately consummates in the New Jerusalem as the mutual dwelling of God and His redeemed for eternity ([link]Rev. 21-22[/link]). This is the greatest blessing to God's people.[br][br][link]Genesis 49:1-28[/link] is an abstract of the entire Bible and a summary of the history of God's people, as seen in the twelve sons of Jacob, the nation of Israel, and the church. It is also a portrait of the personal history of every believer. Jacob's first four sons &amp;#8212; Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah &amp;#8212; were sinners, indicating that the history of God's people begins with sinners. However, two of these sinners, Levi and Judah, were transformed to become priests and kings. Out of the kingship with Judah a kingly salvation was produced, which was preached as the gospel in the Gentile world by Zebulun and which issued in the church life with Issachar. But the apostasy came in through Dan, followed by the recovery with Gad, which issued in the sufficiency of the riches of Christ with Asher and in the resurrection with Naphtali. Finally, the history of God's people concludes with Joseph and Benjamin, who typify Christ as the One who is altogether victorious and perfect, without defect. According to Jacob's prophecy and Moses' word, Joseph brought in God's boundless, universal blessing ([link]vv. 22-26[/link]; [link]Deut. 33:13-16[/link]), and Benjamin, God's eternal dwelling place ([link]Deut. 33:12[/link]). Thus, the conclusion of [link]Gen. 49[/link] corresponds with the conclusion of the entire Bible &amp;#8212; the universal blessing in the new heaven and the new earth, in which is God's eternal dwelling, the New Jerusalem, as the issue and goal of God's universal blessing (cf.
