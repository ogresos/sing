        <note num="1">The book of Genesis concludes with a dead man in a coffin in Egypt ([link]Gen. 50:26[/link]). This indicates that God's chosen people were in a situation of death in Egypt. Although they were in death, they were very living and active (cf. [link]v. 7[/link]). While they were making a living in Egypt and were enjoying the pleasures of Egypt, they were usurped and enslaved by Pharaoh to serve him with harshness ([link]vv. 10-14[/link]; [link]2:23[/link]; [link]5:6-18[/link]). Thus they were detained from fulfilling the purpose for which God had created and chosen them. The situation of the children of Israel in Egypt under Pharaoh's tyranny is a full picture of the life of fallen mankind in the world under the usurping and enslaving hand of Satan and his evil power of darkness.

[link]Gen. 2:18[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 11:9[/link]). Pharaoh's intention to kill the sons and spare the daughters typifies Satan's strategy to destroy the life that is for God's purpose and preserve the life that is for man's pleasure.</note>

        <note num="1">In [link]ch. 1[/link] God used the female life to preserve His people (see note [link chapter="1"]17[sup]1[/sup][/link] there), and in this chapter He used the female life to prepare a savior for His people, whom He had preserved for His purpose. In preparing Moses as a savior for Israel, God used three women &amp;#8212; Moses' mother, Moses' sister, and Pharaoh's daughter &amp;#8212; to give him birth, to nurse him, to rescue him, to raise him, and to train him for His purpose ([link]vv. 2-10[/link]; [link]Acts 7:20-22[/link]). God's use of these women reveals that during critical times the only life that can be used by God is the female life, signifying the life that stands with God and is dependent on Him.

        <note num="1">Moses remained in Midian for forty years ([link]Acts 7:30[/link]). God used the first forty years of Moses' life to build up a man who was strong in the natural life ([link]Acts 7:22[/link]; [link]vv. 11-13[/link]). Then, in order to strip Moses of his natural ability, God arranged to have him work as a shepherd in the land of Midian for another forty years ([link]3:1[/link]). God's work to perfect Moses made him a useful vessel for God's purpose.[br][br]According to Exodus, being useful to God is related to building up His dwelling place and to fighting for His interests on earth. Chapters 1 and 2 show that the life useful to God in these matters is the life signified by the female life. In the Bible a male signifies an independent life, whereas a female signifies a life that depends on God (cf. [link]Luke 1:26-38[/link]). The unique male is God in Christ; only He has an independent life. In their relationship to God all God's people, both men and women, are "females," components of His wife ([link]Isa. 54:5[/link]; [link]John 3:29[/link]). As such, they must live a life that depends on Him for everything and is under His headship ([link]John 15:5[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 11:3[/link]). At the age of forty Moses lived an independent life, taking the position of a "male" before God by exercising his natural strength to strike an Egyptian ([link]vv. 11-12[/link]). In the second forty years of his life Moses was trained by God not to rely on his natural life, and in his third forty years he lived the life of a "female," a life dependent on God. This is the life God can use for the fulfillment of His purpose.</note>

        <note num="1">The title [i]the Angel of Jehovah[/i] refers mainly to Christ, the Son of God, as the One sent by God (cf. [link]John 8:42[/link]) to save His people from their situation of suffering (cf. [link]Judg. 6:12-22[/link]; [link]13:3-22[/link]). According to [link]vv. 2[/link] and [link]6[/link], the Angel of Jehovah, the sent One, was Jehovah Himself, the sending One (cf. [link]Zech. 2:6-11[/link]), and Jehovah is the Triune God ([link]vv. 6[/link], [link]15[/link]). For the purpose of calling and sending Moses, God, the sending One, appeared to him as the sent One (cf. [link]John 20:21[/link]). See [link]Acts 7:30-31[/link] and notes.</note>
        <note num="2">The flame of fire denotes the glory of God's holiness, which excluded fallen man from direct contact with God as the tree of life ([link]Gen. 3:24[/link] and note). According to [link]Gen. 3:17-19[/link] thorns were part of the curse that came because of man's sin. Hence, thorns are a symbol of fallen man under the curse. The thornbush here represents Moses himself as a redeemed sinner. The flame of fire burning within the thornbush signifies that the glory of God's holiness would burn within and upon Moses, God's called one, even though he was a sinner under God's curse. This was possible because of Christ's redemption ([link]Gen. 3:21[/link]; [link]4:4[/link]), which satisfied the requirements of God's holiness and removed the curse, allowing the divine fire (the Spirit) to visit and to indwell the thornbush (the redeemed sinner), making the fire one with the thornbush ([link]Gal. 3:13-14[/link]). The fact that the fire burned in the thornbush without consuming it indicates that God Himself, not Moses, would be the "fuel" for the burning (cf. [link]Rom. 12:11[/link]; [link]2 Tim. 1:7[/link]; [link]Phil. 4:13[/link]; [link]Col. 1:29[/link]). Moses would be only a vessel, a channel, through which the glory of God's holiness would be manifested (cf. [link]2 Cor. 4:7[/link]). See note [link]11[sup]1[/sup][/link].[br][br]According to [link]Deut. 33:16[/link], the thornbush was God's dwelling place. Since God's corporate people are His actual dwelling place ([link]Heb. 3:6[/link] and note), this implies that the thornbush refers also to God's redeemed people as a corporate entity. After the tabernacle, a symbol of the children of Israel as God's dwelling place, was built up, at night the cloud of God's glory upon it had the appearance of fire ([link]Num. 9:15-16[/link]). The fire burning upon the tabernacle signified that the people of Israel were a corporate burning thornbush. The church as God's dwelling place is also a burning thornbush &amp;#8212; the Triune God burning within and upon a redeemed humanity ([link]Luke 12:49[/link]; [link]Acts 2:3-4[/link]). Through the burning of the holy divine fire, the once cursed and redeemed thornbush is transformed to be God's dwelling place. This is God's economy.</note>

        <note num="1">The purpose of God's calling of Moses was, negatively, to deliver the children of Israel out of the usurpation and tyranny of Pharaoh and Egypt, and, positively, to bring them into Canaan, the land flowing with milk and honey ([link]Deut. 8:7-9[/link]), where they could establish God's kingdom ([link]19:6[/link]; [link]2 Sam. 5:12[/link]; [link]7:12[/link], [link]16[/link]) and build up His dwelling place on earth ([link]2 Sam. 7:13[/link]). In typology, this signifies delivering people out of the usurpation and tyranny of Satan and the world, and bringing people into Christ, the all-inclusive One typified by the land of Canaan (see note [link]7[sup]1[/sup] in Deut. 8[/link]), for the building up of the church as God's kingdom and God's dwelling place on earth ([link]Rom. 14:17[/link]; [link]Eph. 2:20-22[/link]; [link]4:12[/link]).[br][br]As revealed in this chapter, in fulfilling God's purpose the children of Israel passed through three stations: the wilderness ([link]v. 18[/link]), the mountain ([link]v. 12[/link]), and the good land ([link]vv. 8[/link], [link]17[/link]). By the passover ([link]12:11[/link], [link]31-41[/link]) and the crossing of the Red Sea ([link]14:21-30[/link]) the children of Israel came out of Egypt and into the wilderness. Then, they were brought to the mountain by means of the tree which made the bitter waters sweet ([link]15:23-25[/link]), by means of the twelve springs at Elim ([link]15:27[/link]), by means of the manna from heaven ([link]16:14-15[/link], [link]31-32[/link], [link]35[/link]), by means of the living water from the cleft rock ([link]17:6[/link]), and by means of the victory over Amalek ([link]17:8-16[/link]). At the mountain they received a revelation of what God is, of the life they should live according to God's attributes, and of the desire of God's heart to have a dwelling place on earth among His people ([link]chs. 19-34[/link]). They also built the tabernacle as God's temporary dwelling place on earth ([link]chs. 35-40[/link]). Finally, by the Ark with the tabernacle the children of Israel entered into the good land ([link]Josh. 3:3[/link], [link]6[/link], [link]8[/link], [link]13-17[/link]; [link]4:10-19[/link]). There, through the enjoyment of the rich produce of the land, they defeated the Canaanites, who occupied the land, and built the temple as God's permanent dwelling on earth ([link]1 Kings 6[/link]). Such a history of the children of Israel is a portrait of a believer's full salvation.</note>

        <note num="1">In [link]chapter 3[/link] God gave Moses the sign of the thornbush ([link]3:2-3[/link]). In this chapter God gave Moses three additional signs as evidence that he had truly been called and sent by God. The meaning of the first sign, the sign of the staff becoming a serpent ([link]vv. 2-4[/link]), is that anything we rely on apart from God &amp;#8212; our education, our occupation, etc. &amp;#8212; is actually the hiding place of Satan, the usurping serpent. However, when at God's word we throw it down and then take it up again "by the tail," i.e., in the way opposite to the practice of the worldly people, using it for God's purpose and not for ourselves, it becomes a staff of authority ([link]vv. 4[/link], [link]17[/link]; [link]Luke 10:19[/link]). In the second sign, the sign of the hand becoming leprous ([link]vv. 6-7[/link]), the bosom signifies what is within us, and leprosy signifies sin. This sign shows that our flesh is the embodiment of leprosy; in it there is nothing good, nothing but sin, corruption, and uncleanness ([link]Rom. 7:17-18[/link]; cf. [link]Isa. 6:5[/link]). Nevertheless, when we obey the Lord by keeping His word, His cleansing power is able to make us clean (cf. [link]2 Kings 5:1-14[/link]). The meaning of the third sign, the sign of the water becoming blood ([link]v. 9[/link]), is that in the eyes of God all the earthly supply and worldly enjoyment (the water of the Nile) are nothing but death (blood). When they are poured out on that which produces life (the ground), immediately the death is exposed.[br][br]Satan is against Christ ([link]1 John 3:8[/link]); the flesh is against the Spirit ([link]Gal. 5:17[/link]); and the world is against the Father ([link]1 John 2:15[/link]). Hence, these three negative things are opposed to the Triune God and His economy. In one whom God has called, Satan, the flesh, and the world have lost their ground (cf. [link]John 14:30[/link]; [link]Gal. 5:24[/link]; [link]6:14[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">God's seeking to kill Moses ([link]v. 24[/link]) compelled Zipporah, Moses' Gentile wife, to circumcise her son. This circumcising signified the cutting off of the natural life (see note [link]10[sup]1[/sup] in Gen. 17[/link]). This was required by God to usher Moses into his ministry, for an uncircumcised person, one who still lives in the flesh or the natural life, could have no part in God's ministry or in the covenant God made with Abraham regarding the inheriting of the good land ([link]Gen. 17:9-15[/link]). Those who would be used by God must bear the sign of having been "cut" subjectively in their natural life. After the matching by Aaron ([link]vv. 14-16[/link]) and the cutting by Zipporah, God's calling of Moses was complete.</note>
        <note num="2">The expression [i]bridegroom of blood[/i] implies that in the eyes of Zipporah, circumcision meant that her husband, Moses, was under the sentence of death (cf. [link]2 Cor. 1:9[/link]; [link]4:10-12[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">The book of Exodus describes twelve conflicts between Jehovah and Pharaoh ([link]5:1-11:10[/link]; [link]12:29-36[/link]). God's people had fallen into a worldly life under Pharaoh's usurpation. God's desire is that His people would be His dwelling place on earth; however, this desire cannot be fulfilled unless His people are delivered from the world and separated to Him. God's purpose in the twelve conflicts with Pharaoh was to execute His judgment on the world and its ruler, and to expose to His people the nature, meaning, and result of life in the world under Pharaoh's usurpation, so that they would hate that life (cf. [link]1 John 2:15-17[/link]), flee from it, and be gathered to the Lord at the mountain of God to receive the revelation concerning God and His dwelling place ([link]19:1-34:35[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">In dealing with Pharaoh, a type of Satan as the persecutor and usurper of His people, God told him that He was Jehovah, the unique self-existing One; the God of Israel, the God of a transformed, victorious, and kingly people; and the God of the Hebrews ([link]v. 3[/link]), the God of the river crossers. See notes [link]4[sup]4[/sup] in Gen. 2[/link], [link]13[sup]1[/sup] in Gen. 28[/link], and [link]18[sup]1[/sup] in Exo. 3[/link].</note>

        <note num="1">After the first two conflicts with Pharaoh, God used ten plagues to punish the Egyptians so that they might release His people, and to educate both the Egyptians and His people concerning the nature of the life in the world that they might be willing to forsake the worldly life. The ten plagues can be grouped into four categories. The first group includes the plagues of blood, frogs, and lice ([link]7:15-8:19[/link]); the second group, the plagues of flies, pestilence, and boils ([link]8:20-9:12[/link]); the third group, the plagues of hail, locusts, and darkness ([link]9:13-10:29[/link]); and the fourth group, the plague of the killing of the firstborn ([link]11:1-10[/link]; [link]12:29-30[/link]). The plagues in the first group were troublesome but not injurious; the plagues in the second group caused harm both to beasts and to men; the plagues in the third group destroyed the environment; and the last plague terminated the worldly life. By means of the ten plagues God was able to accomplish the exodus of His chosen people from Egypt and fully expose the nature and result of the life in the world (cf.

According to His righteousness God should have judged the heavens and the earth immediately after the fall of Adam. However, in order to fulfill His purpose to have a dwelling place among men, God put the universe under the redemption of Christ, which in His eternal view was foreordained before the foundation of the world ([link]1 Pet. 1:19-20[/link] and note [link]20[sup]1[/sup][/link]; [link]Heb. 2:9[/link] and note 3). Hence, God has the freedom to either preserve the universe or to judge it and destroy it. Today, God extends His mercy by viewing all the people of the world under the redemption of Christ so that they might have the opportunity to repent and receive His redemption (cf. [link]John 3:18[/link]). Pharaoh and the Egyptians rejected the redemption ordained by God and thus exposed themselves to God's judgment (cf. [link]1 John 2:2[/link] and note 2). Because God covered the children of Israel with Christ's redemption, God's judgment did not touch them ([link]12:23[/link]).</note>

This blood opened the way for the redeemed ones to enter into the houses, implying that the blood of Christ opens the way for us to enter into Christ, who is typified by the house ([link]Heb. 10:19[/link]). The same blood closed the way to the destroyer, thereby guarding the redeemed from judgment ([link]v. 23[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">The houses in which the children of Israel ate the passover lamb typify Christ. The lamb was the means of redemption, and the house was the means of preserving the redeemed ones. As the redeeming one, Christ is the lamb, and as the keeping one, He is the house. The blood of the lamb was on the door, and the flesh of the lamb was in the house. The lamb, the house, and those who enjoyed the passover thus became one. This is a picture of the identification of the redeemed ones with Christ. See note [link]22[sup]2[/sup][/link].</note>

        <note num="1">The blood of the passover lamb was for redemption, to redeem the children of Israel out of God's death-judgment, and the flesh of the lamb was for life supply, to strengthen the people to move out of Egypt. The flesh of the lamb signifies the crucified and resurrected life of Christ as the supply for God's redeemed people. Through Christ's incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection His flesh has become the food of God's redeemed. In the reality of the passover, Christ's blood is drinkable, Christ's flesh is eatable, and Christ in totality is eatable ([link]John 6:51-57[/link], [link]63[/link] and notes).</note>
        <note num="2">In the Scriptures leaven signifies what is sinful, evil, corrupt, and unclean in the eyes of God ([link]1 Cor. 5:6[/link], [link]8[/link]). To eat with unleavened bread means to eliminate all sinful things (see note [link]15[sup]2[/sup][/link]). To eat with bitter herbs means to regret and repent, to experience a bitter taste regarding sinful things.</note>

        <note num="1">To eat Christ "raw" is to regard Christ not as the Redeemer but only as a model or example of human living to be imitated. To eat Christ as if He were boiled with water is to regard His death on the cross merely as martyrdom under man's persecution, not as death for our redemption. To eat Christ "roasted with fire" is to believe that on the cross Christ suffered for us under God's holy wrath exercised in His judgment, as signified by the fire here ([link]Heb. 12:29[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">The head signifies wisdom, the legs signify activity and move, and the inward parts signify the inward parts of Christ's being, including His mind, emotion, will, and heart with all their functions.

        <note num="1">The children of Israel applied the passover in such a way that they could become God's army ([link]vv. 17[/link], [link]41[/link], [link]51[/link]). Both their girding their loins and their putting sandals on their feet were their preparation for fighting (cf. [link]Eph. 6:14a[/link], [link]15[/link]). The girdle, the sandals, and the staff were all for their journey out of Egypt, a journey of warfare ([link]13:18[/link]). Because the battle was imminent, they ate the passover lamb in haste. Their eating of the lamb equipped them for the battle.</note>
        <note num="2">The noun [i]passover,[/i] from the verb [i]pass over[/i] ([link]v. 13[/link]), indicates that the judgment of God passes over us because of the blood of Christ, the real Passover lamb ([link]John 1:29[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">The firstborn here signifies the natural man, the old man in Adam. Since Adam was the first man ([link]1 Cor. 15:45a[/link]), the firstborn includes everyone who is in Adam (cf. [link]1 Cor. 15:22a[/link]). The redeeming blood of Christ is not effective for those who remain in Adam (see note [link]2[sup]2[/sup] in 1 John 2[/link]; cf. note [link book="Exo." chapter="12"]22[sup]2[/sup][/link] in this chapter). Furthermore, to apply Christ as the Passover in a complete and adequate way, we must condemn everything within us that is related to the firstborn, that is, to Adam ([link]1 Cor. 5:6-8[/link]; [link]Eph. 4:22[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">The firstborn were the constituents of Egypt, whereas the gods were components of Satan's kingdom. During the passover both were judged. Behind all the gods of Egypt were Satan and the demons (cf. [link]1 Cor. 10:20[/link]). Therefore, on the night of the passover, Satan and all the demons also were judged. In the fulfillment of the passover, both the world and Satan with his evil power of darkness were judged by God through Christ's death on the cross ([link]John 12:31[/link]; [link]Col. 2:15[/link]; [link]Heb. 2:14[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">The Passover itself, held on the fourteenth day of the first month ([link]vv. 2[/link], [link]6[/link]), lasted only one day. Continuing from the Passover, the Feast of Unleavened Bread lasted seven days ([link]vv. 15-20[/link]; [link]13:6-7[/link]). See notes [link]17[sup]1[/sup] in Matt. 26[/link] and [link]8[sup]1[/sup] in 1 Cor. 5[/link].</note>
        <note num="2">In the Feast of the Passover the lamb was to be eaten with unleavened bread ([link]v. 8[/link] and note 2). In the continuation of the Passover the eating of unleavened bread for seven days (a full course of time) signifies that for our entire Christian life, from the time we receive Christ and are saved, we should continue our enjoyment by eliminating everything sinful. During the seven days of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, no leaven was to be found in the houses ([link]v. 19[/link]), and no leaven was to be seen among the people of Israel ([link]13:7[/link]). This signifies that, although it is impossible for us to be completely without sin, we must eliminate any sin that is seen; i.e., we must forsake the sin of which we are conscious (cf. [link]Heb. 12:1[/link]). To deal with manifested sin is to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread ([link]1 Cor. 5:7-8[/link]). If we tolerate sin once it is exposed, we will lose the enjoyment of the fellowship of God's people ([link]v. 19[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 5:13[/link]). The only way to eliminate sin is to daily eat Christ as the crucified, resurrected, and sinless life, signified by the unleavened bread.</note>

        <note num="1">Hyssop was among the smallest of the plants ([link]1 Kings 4:33[/link]). Here it signifies our faith, which God does not require to be great ([link]Matt. 17:20[/link]).

Instead, He turned them around by the way of the wilderness to the Red Sea, leading them seemingly to a dead end ([link]14:2-3[/link]).

Thus, the bringing of Joseph's bones out of Egypt into the good land signifies resurrection and indicates that those who share in the kingdom of God will no longer be in the natural life, signified by flesh and blood, but in the resurrection life, signified by Joseph's bones ([link]1 Cor. 15:50[/link]). In the eyes of God all the children of Israel had been dead and buried in Egypt (see note [link]6[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 1[/link]). The exodus from Egypt, therefore, was actually a resurrection. The exodus from the world, the genuine sanctification to the Lord ([link]v. 2[/link]), and a new beginning of a sinless life ([link]vv. 4-7[/link]) can be accomplished only by the resurrection life.</note>

Hence, the instant, living leading from God comes through either the Spirit or the Word. The two pillars symbolize God Himself, for He is both the Spirit and the Word ([link]John 4:24[/link]; [link]1:1[/link]). Furthermore, the Word is also the Spirit ([link]John 6:63[/link]; [link]Eph. 6:17[/link]). Thus, God, the Word, and the Spirit are one to lead and guide us continually, whether by day or by night. In the Christian life there is no difference between day and night, for the light from the pillar of fire causes the night to become day.</note>

        <note num="1">Like the passing of Noah's ark through the waters of the flood, the crossing of the Red Sea was a type of baptism ([link]1 Cor. 10:1-2[/link] and notes [link]1[sup]4[/sup][/link] through [link]2[sup]3[/sup][/link]; [link]Gen. 7:17-23[/link] and note [link]17[sup]1[/sup][/link]). The waters of the Red Sea were used by God to save His people and separate them from Pharaoh and Egypt. The children of Israel were saved through the Red Sea into the wilderness, a realm of resurrection and separation ([link]15:22[/link] and note 1), where they were free from all bondage and slavery to fulfill God's purpose by building the tabernacle as God's dwelling place on earth. Likewise, through baptism the New Testament believers are saved from Satan and the world into a realm of resurrection ([link]Rom. 6:3-5[/link]) and separation ([link]Acts 2:40-41[/link]), in which they are free to accomplish God's purpose by building up the church as the dwelling place of God.[br][br]This marked the completion of the first stage of God's complete salvation of His chosen people, a stage that included the passover, the exodus from Egypt, and the crossing of the Red Sea. The passover, typifying Christ with His redemption, was sufficient to save God's people from God's righteous judgment ([link]12:12-13[/link]). However, in order to be saved absolutely from the tyranny of Pharaoh and the enslavement in Egypt, the children of Israel needed the exodus and the crossing of the Red Sea. Likewise, after enjoying Christ's redemption to be saved from God's judgment, the New Testament believers need to leave the world and be baptized (cf. [link]Mark 16:16a[/link] and note 1).</note>

        <note num="1">In poetic form [link]vv. 14-15[/link] are a prophecy that the children of Israel would defeat God's enemies and take possession of the good land. The peoples signify the unbelievers, the heathen: the Philistines, who lived between Egypt and the good land, signify the people of the religious world ([link]1 Sam. 6:1-18[/link] and note [link]4[sup]1[/sup][/link]); the Edomites, the descendants of Esau ([link]Gen. 36:1[/link]), signify those who are natural, those who are not chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and transformed ([link]Rom. 9:10-13[/link]); the descendants of Lot, the Moabites, signify the fleshly ones, for their source was an act of incest ([link]Gen. 19:30-38[/link]); and the Canaanites are related to the evil powers in the heavenlies ([link]Eph. 6:12[/link]). The intention of all the enemies was to keep God's people from reaching His goal &amp;#8212; the building of His dwelling place for the fulfillment of His purpose. Nevertheless, in the eyes of God His goal has already been achieved. Thus, Moses used the perfect tense when speaking of God's habitation ([link]vv. 13[/link], [link]17[/link]) and the apostle John used the past tense in describing the New Jerusalem ([link]Rev. 21:2-22:5[/link]).</note>

In the Bible a spring signifies life that flows out of God in resurrection into His chosen people ([link]John 4:10[/link], [link]14[/link]; [link]7:37-39[/link]; [link]Rev. 22:1[/link]), and palm trees signify life that is flourishing ([link]Psa. 92:12[/link]), rejoicing in satisfaction ([link]Lev. 23:40[/link]; [link]Neh. 8:15[/link]), and victorious over tribulation ([link]John 12:13[/link]; [link]Rev. 7:9[/link]). The number twelve signifies the mingling of divinity with humanity for the complete and perfect carrying out of God's administration eternally (see notes [link book="Rev." chapter="21"]12[sup]2[/sup][/link] and [link]13[sup]1[/sup] in Rev. 21[/link] and note [link]2[sup]4[/sup] in Rev. 22[/link]). Seventy equals seven times ten. The number seven signifies completion and perfection in God's dispensational move (see note [link]29[sup]1[/sup] in Rev. 2[/link]), and the number ten signifies fullness (see note [link]10[sup]2[/sup] in Rev. 2[/link]). Hence, the number seventy signifies completion and perfection temporally for God's dispensational move in full. Thus, the twelve springs at Elim signify God as living water flowing into His chosen people to be mingled with them for the accomplishing of His eternal administration, and the seventy palm trees signify God as life growing in His people to carry out His administration dispensationally to express the riches of the divine life and its victory.[br][br]When used together, the numbers twelve and seventy signify that God's people are to carry out His ministry ([link]24:1[/link], [link]4[/link]; [link]Luke 9:1[/link]; [link]10:1[/link]) by the flowing life signified by the twelve springs and the growing life signified by the seventy palm trees.</note>

        <note num="1">Murmuring is an expression of the flesh, the totality of man's fallen being (cf. [link]Phil. 2:14[/link]). Although the thirst of the people had been quenched by the twelve springs at Elim ([link]15:27[/link]), the people were still hungry because of the lack of food. In such a situation the flesh of God's people was exposed. This shows that the shortage of Christ as our spiritual nourishment will always cause our flesh with its lusts to be exposed. After the flesh was exposed, God sent manna to nourish His people ([link]vv. 13-15[/link]). God's way of dealing with the flesh of His people is to change their diet. The only way to conquer the flesh is to be filled with Christ by enjoying Him daily as the heavenly life supply, signified by manna (see notes [link]4[sup]1[/sup][/link] and [link]15[sup]1[/sup][/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">The Egyptian diet denotes the worldly things and amusements that people feed on in order to find satisfaction. In Egypt the children of Israel had eaten only Egyptian food; hence, they had become Egyptian in both their constitution and their appetite. Their desire here for Egyptian food indicates that their experience of redemption through the passover lamb and the exodus from Egypt with the crossing of the Red Sea had not changed their inward constitution and worldly taste ([link]Num. 11:4-5[/link]). Contrary to God's desire, the people wanted to live the same way as they had lived in Egypt (cf. [link]1 Pet. 1:18[/link] and note 2).</note>

        <note num="1">This was manna ([link]vv. 15[/link], [link]31[/link]), a type of Christ as the unique, heavenly food for God's people ([link]John 6:31-35[/link]). By giving them manna to eat, God indicated that His intention was to change the nature of His people, to change their very constitution, for the accomplishing of His purpose. Because the children of Israel were still constituted with the Egyptian element and were thus the same as the Egyptians, they were not qualified to build up the tabernacle as God's habitation on earth. For forty years God gave the children of Israel nothing to eat but manna ([link]v. 35[/link]; [link]Num. 11:6[/link]). This shows that God's intention in His salvation is to work Himself into the believers in Christ and to change their constitution by feeding them with Christ as their unique heavenly food, thereby reconstituting them with Christ in order to qualify them to build up the church as God's dwelling place. In fact, after being reconstituted with Christ, the believers themselves become the dwelling place of God (cf. [link]1 Cor. 3:16-17[/link]; [link]6:19[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 6:16[/link]; [link]1 Tim. 3:15[/link]; [link]Heb. 3:6[/link]; [link]Rev. 21:2-3[/link]).</note>

By contrast, the eating of quails was wild and without restriction ([link]v. 13a[/link]; [link]Num. 11:31-33a[/link]), corresponding to the Egyptian style, fashion, and manner.</note>

        <note num="1">Heb. [i]man hu,[/i] from which the word [i]manna[/i] derives. Manna is a type of Christ as the heavenly food that enables God's people to go His way ([link]John 6:31-35[/link], [link]48-51[/link], [link]57-58[/link]). According to God's economy, Christ should be the unique diet, the only food, strength, satisfaction, and sustenance, of God's chosen people, and they should live by Him alone ([link]Num. 11:6[/link]; [link]John 6:57[/link]). In order to be food to us, Christ was incarnated, crucified, and resurrected to become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit to indwell our spirit ([link]John 6:63[/link] and notes).[br][br]Although it is known that manna came from heaven ([link]v. 4[/link]), the element and essence of manna are a mystery. Manna did not belong to the old creation; nevertheless, it could nourish man's physical body. Thus, it must have contained certain elements and minerals that were a part of the old creation. As the real manna, Christ also is mysterious. In resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit ([link]1 Cor. 15:45[/link]), yet He has a body that can be seen and touched ([link]Luke 24:36-43[/link]). Thus, it is difficult to say whether Christ is spiritual or material.</note>

        <note num="1">The open manna, the manna that lay on the ground every morning, was for the enjoyment of God's people in a public way. However, the omer of manna placed in a pot ([link]v. 33[/link]) was hidden and was not for the congregation in a public way. The amount of manna kept in a pot before Jehovah was one omer, the same as the amount gathered and eaten by the people ([link]vv. 16-18[/link]). In spiritual experience, this indicates that the amount of Christ we eat is the amount we can preserve. The Christ whom we eat as open manna spontaneously becomes hidden manna by being digested and assimilated into our inner being. Furthermore, whatever we eat of Christ will become a memorial in generations to come. The Christ whom we eat and enjoy will be an eternal memorial, because such a Christ becomes our very constitution, enabling us to build up and even to become God's dwelling place in the universe.</note>

        <note num="1">According to [link]Heb. 9:3-4[/link], the manna was kept in a golden pot in the Ark of the Testimony, which was in the Holy of Holies in the tabernacle. In the Bible gold signifies the divine nature. The manna in the golden pot signifies that the Christ whom we enjoy as our life supply is preserved within us in the divine nature, which we received through regeneration ([link]2 Pet. 1:4[/link]). The Ark, in which the golden pot with the manna was kept, typifies Christ. Christ as the hidden manna is preserved in the divine nature, and the divine nature is in Christ, typified by the Ark. This Christ is in our spirit ([link]2 Tim. 4:22[/link]), which in our experience is the Holy of Holies (see note [link]19[sup]1[/sup] in Heb. 10[/link]). The manna preserved in the golden pot was the center of the tabernacle, God's dwelling place in the Old Testament; likewise, the Christ whom we have eaten, digested, and assimilated is the center of our being as a part of the church, God's dwelling place today ([link]2 Tim. 4:22[/link]; [link]Eph. 2:22[/link]).[br][br][link]Revelation 2:17[/link] indicates that the overcomers, who overcome the degradation of the worldly church, will be given to eat the hidden manna and will be given a white stone (see notes [link book="Rev." chapter="2"]17[sup]2[/sup][/link] and [link]17[sup]3[/sup] in Rev. 2[/link]). This indicates that as we eat Christ and preserve Him as the hidden manna within us, He makes us overcomers and also transforms us into white stones for the building of God's dwelling place, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem.</note>

The law is a testimony of what God is (see note [link]1[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 20[/link]). Hence, the fact that the manna in the golden pot was placed before the testimony indicates that manna corresponds to God's testimony, God's law, and meets its requirements. When we take Christ as our heavenly life supply, Christ as the hidden manna preserved in the divine nature within us causes us to correspond to God's testimony and to fulfill its requirements ([link]Rom. 8:4[/link]), thereby making us God's expression.</note>

[link]John 6:31-35[/link]; [link]7:37-39[/link]), indicating that in the beginning of our spiritual life our eating of Christ in His word ([link]Jer. 15:16[/link]; [link]Matt. 4:4[/link]; [link]John 6:63[/link]) issues in the flowing of the Spirit as the living water within us. However, at the end of the Bible the river of water of life is mentioned before the tree of life ([link]Rev. 22:1-2[/link]), and the tree of life grows in (i.e., is conveyed in) the river, indicating that as we progress in spiritual experience, the Spirit as the flowing river brings us the supply of the word, the manna. This implies that ultimately in the divine concept eating is included in drinking and drinking is more important than eating.[br][br]In the Bible the basic principle concerning man's relationship with God is that man needs to eat and drink of God. It is by eating and drinking that we, God's chosen people, take God into us, and it is through our eating and drinking Him that God works Himself into us to be one with us organically.</note>

        <note num="1">According to Paul's word in [link]1 Cor. 10:4[/link], the rock here was Christ. Furthermore, it was a spiritual rock that followed the children of Israel in their journeys (cf. [link]Num. 20:8-11[/link]). See note [link]4[sup]2[/sup] in 1 Cor. 10[/link].</note>
        <note num="2">The striking of the rock is a clear, complete, and full picture of Christ's crucifixion. The rock was struck by the staff of Moses ([link]v. 5[/link]). In this type, Moses signifies the law, and the staff represents the power and authority of the law. Hence, the striking of the rock by Moses' staff signifies that Christ was put to death on the cross by the authority of God's law (cf. [link]Gal. 2:19-20a[/link]; [link]3:13[/link]).</note>
        <note num="3">The water flowing out of the smitten rock typifies the Spirit ([link]John 7:37-39[/link]). Through incarnation Christ came to the earth as a rock. On the cross He was smitten by the authority of God's righteous law to accomplish God's redemption. His side was pierced, and living water flowed out for God's people to drink ([link]John 19:34[/link] and note). This living water is the water of life in resurrection, the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit as the ultimate issue of the Triune God ([link]1 Cor. 15:45[/link]; see note [link]39[sup]1[/sup] in John 7[/link]). The source of the water of life is the throne of God and of the Lamb &amp;#8212; the redeeming God ([link]Rev. 22:1[/link]). Hence, the water of life is the Triune God flowing out to be our life. The flow of the living water began from the throne in eternity, continued through the incarnation, human living, and crucifixion of Christ ([link]John 4:10[/link], [link]14[/link]; [link]19:34[/link]), and now flows on in resurrection to supply God's people with all the riches of the divine life ([link]Rev. 22:1-2[/link]). When we identify ourselves with the smitten Christ, the divine life as the living water flows out of us ([link]John 7:38[/link]). The flowing of the water of life in resurrection is for the building up of the Body of Christ ([link]1 Cor. 12:13[/link]) and the preparation of the bride of Christ ([link]Rev. 19:7[/link]), both of which will consummate in the New Jerusalem ([link]Rev. 21:9-10[/link]; cf. [link]Eph. 5:23[/link], [link]28-30[/link]).[br][br]To drink of the water of life, we first need to be positioned to drink ([link]1 Cor. 12:13[/link]), and we also need to be thirsty ([link]John 7:37[/link]; [link]Rev. 21:6[/link]). Then we need to come to the Lord ([link]John 7:37[/link]; [link]Rev. 22:17[/link]), to ask of the Lord ([link]John 4:10[/link]), to believe in the Lord ([link]John 7:38[/link]), and to call on the name of the Lord ([link]Isa. 12:3-4[/link]; [link]Acts 2:21[/link]).</note>

The fighting between Amalek and Israel depicts the conflict between the flesh and the Spirit within the believers ([link]Gal. 5:17[/link]; cf. [link]1 Pet. 2:11[/link]). Amalek was a descendant of Esau ([link]Gen. 36:12[/link]), Jacob's twin brother. This indicates that the flesh is very close to our regenerated being, signified by Jacob. Esau was born first and Jacob second, indicating that the flesh is of the first man, the old man.</note>

This indicates that our flesh is the first among all our enemies. The flesh, sin, the world, and Satan are all related, but the most prominent among them in fighting against the believers is the flesh ([link]Gal. 5:17[/link]). When in our experience the flesh is put to death ([link]Gal. 5:24[/link]; [link]Rom. 8:13[/link]), the world cannot hold us, sin cannot operate in us, and Satan is powerless to work on us. Amalek's purpose in attacking Israel was to frustrate them from entering the good land. Likewise, Satan's aim in stirring up the flesh to fight against us is to keep us from entering into the full enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ as our good land (see note [link]7[sup]1[/sup] in Deut. 8[/link]).</note>

[link]1 Tim. 2:8[/link]), and Joshua typifies Christ as the indwelling Spirit fighting against the flesh ([link]Rom. 8:9-11[/link]; [link]Gal. 5:16-17[/link]). Amalek was defeated by Israel through the supply of the manna ([link]ch. 16[/link]) and the living water ([link]vv. 1-6[/link]) and by the lifting up of Moses' hands and the fighting of Joshua. Likewise, we are victorious over the flesh by eating and drinking Christ as our life supply and by praying with the interceding Christ and putting the flesh to death with Christ as the fighting Spirit ([link]Rom. 8:13[/link] and note 2; [link]Gal. 5:24[/link] and note 2).</note>

        <note num="1">As the one praying on the mountaintop, Moses typifies Christ, but as the one whose hands became heavy, Moses represents us. This signifies that while Christ is praying in the heavens, we too need to pray on earth ([link]1 Tim. 2:8[/link]). Because the flesh never changes or improves, in order to prevail against the flesh, we need to pray without ceasing ([link]1 Thes. 5:17[/link]; [link]Col. 4:2[/link]), joining ourselves to Christ in His intercession. However, often our praying hands become heavy. Thus, we need a stone to support us, and we need the help of Aaron and Hur. The stone, a solid base for our prayer life, refers to our realization that in ourselves we are weak and that in order to sustain our prayer, we need Christ to be our support (cf. [link]John 15:5b[/link]). Aaron, the high priest ([link]28:1[/link]; [link]Heb. 5:1[/link], [link]4[/link]), signifies the priesthood, and Hur, who was of the tribe of Judah ([link]31:2[/link]), signifies the kingship ([link]Gen. 49:10[/link]). The priesthood is related to the Holy of Holies, which in our experience is always related to our spirit ([link]Heb. 10:19[/link] and note). Hence, to sustain our prayer and to thus defeat the flesh, we need the priesthood to strengthen our spirit. We also need to be obedient to the Lord under His authority, the kingship. Furthermore, Hur is related to the building of the tabernacle ([link]31:2-5[/link]), and the direction of Exodus is toward this goal. This indicates that we need to take the building of the church as the goal of our prayer.</note>

        <note num="1">[link]Exodus 18[/link] presents a type, a portrait, of the kingdom of God, in which the tabernacle, God's dwelling place, was built. The fact that this portrait is presented after the war against Amalek signifies that when the flesh as God's enemy is dealt with, the kingdom with the kingship immediately comes in (cf. [link]Gal. 5:17-25[/link]), and the church as the Body of Christ is built up (cf. [link]1 Kings 1-8[/link]). In order to realize the kingdom with the building of the church, we must utterly repudiate the flesh in both its good and evil aspects (cf. [link]Phil. 3:3-10[/link]). Saul lost the kingship because he did not utterly destroy Amalek but spared the best of what was to be destroyed ([link]1 Sam. 15[/link] and notes).[br][br]According to historical sequence, the events described in [link]ch. 18[/link] took place after the building of the tabernacle and not long before the children of Israel began their journey with the tabernacle toward the good land ([link]Deut. 1:6-18[/link]). Under divine inspiration Moses inserted these events after [link]ch. 17[/link] to show that in the experience of God's full salvation the kingdom comes after God's people have been delivered from Satan (Pharaoh) and the world (Egypt), and after the flesh (Amalek) has been defeated and subdued.

        <text>And all the people answered together and said, [note]1[/note]All that Jehovah has spoken [xref]a[/xref]we will do. And Moses brought back the words of the people to Jehovah.</text>
        <note num="1">This seemingly positive answer, given here and in [link]24:3[/link], [link]7[/link], was offensive to God, for it indicated that the children of Israel knew neither God nor themselves and did not have a heart for God (cf. [link]Matt. 15:8[/link]). They presumed that they could do whatever God required, not knowing that they were unable to fulfill His commandments and that they stood in need of His mercy. Even before the decree of the law had been completed, the people fell into the sin of idolatry, breaking at least the first three of the Ten Commandments ([link]20:2-7[/link]; [link]32:1-6[/link] and notes). After the people spoke this word, God changed His attitude toward them and also caused a change of atmosphere ([link]vv. 9[/link], [link]12-13[/link], [link]16-25[/link]; [link]20:18-19[/link]; cf. [link]19:3-6[/link]).[br][br]God's eternal purpose is to have a people to be His counterpart, His expression, and His dwelling place. In order to fulfill this purpose, God must impart Himself as life into His chosen people and work Himself into them. From the very beginning it was not God's intention to give man commandments to keep or to have man do things for Him (see note [link]17[sup]1[/sup] in Gen. 2[/link]). Likewise, in bringing the children of Israel to the mountain of God, it was not God's intention to give them a list of divine commandments as requirements for them to fulfill. Rather, His intention was to bring His people into His presence so that He could reveal Himself to them and impart Himself into them through His speaking to them (cf. [link]34:28-29[/link] and note [link]29[sup]1[/sup][/link]). God's people, however, did not understand His intention. Their natural, fallen, and religious concept was that God wanted them to do certain things for Him, and they thought they were able to do these things. Since this was their concept, it was necessary for God to give them commandments to show them how high His requirements are and how unable to fulfill these requirements they were ([link]Rom. 8:3a[/link], [link]7-8[/link]).[br][br]The law decreed by God on Mount Sinai has both a positive and a negative function. On the positive side the law functions as God's testimony, revealing God to His people (see note [link]1[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 20[/link]). The law is also God's living word as His breath ([link]2 Tim. 3:16[/link]) to infuse His element into His loving seekers (see note [link]3[sup]1[/sup] in Deut. 8[/link]). On the negative side, the function of the law is to expose sin ([link]Rom. 3:20[/link]; [link]5:20[/link]; [link]7:7-8[/link], [link]13[/link]), to subdue sinners ([link]Rom. 3:19[/link]), and to guard God's chosen people and bring them to Christ ([link]Gal. 3:23-24[/link]). Whether in our experience the law is positive or negative depends on the condition of our heart in receiving the law. If we love God, humble ourselves, and regard the law as His living word through which we contact Him and abide in Him, the law will become a channel through which the divine life and substance are conveyed to us for our supply and nourishment. Being infused with God's substance through the law as God's word, we will become one with God in life, nature, and expression and will spontaneously live a life that expresses God and corresponds to His law ([link]Rom. 8:4[/link]; [link]Phil. 1:21a[/link]). However, if in coming to the law we do not seek God in love but rather separate the law from the living God as the source of life (cf. [link]John 5:39-40[/link]), the law, which was intended to result in life ([link]Rom. 7:10[/link]) but cannot give life of itself ([link]Gal. 3:21[/link] and note 1), will become a condemning and killing element to us ([link]Rom. 7:11[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 3:6-7[/link], [link]9[/link]).

        <note num="2">The mountain where the law was given has a twofold significance. First, as Mount Horeb, it is the mountain of God ([link]3:1[/link], [link]12[/link]; [link]4:27[/link]; [link]18:5[/link]; [link]24:13[/link]; [link]Num. 10:33[/link]; [link]1 Kings 19:8[/link]), the place for God's seekers to meet with one another ([link]4:27[/link]; [link]18:5[/link]), to meet with God ([link]24:13[/link], [link]15-18[/link]; [link]1 Kings 19:8[/link]), to serve God ([link]3:12[/link]), to receive God's revelation and vision ([link]3:1-3[/link]; [link]24:12-13[/link]; [link]1 Kings 19:8-9[/link]), and to be infused with God's substance ([link]34:28-29[/link]). Second, as Mount Sinai ([link]vv. 11[/link], [link]18[/link], [link]20-24[/link]; [link]34:2-4[/link]; [link]Gal. 4:24-25[/link]), it is the place where the sinfulness of God's people is exposed and the boundary of God's holiness is revealed ([link]vv. 12-13[/link], [link]21-24[/link]; [link]Heb. 12:18-21[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">In fellowship with God we know not only His grace ([link]v. 4[/link]) but also His holiness. Mount Sinai was a holy mountain because God descended upon it ([link]v. 20[/link]; cf. [link]3:5[/link]). Thus, a boundary was set which the children of Israel were not permitted to cross ([link]vv. 12-13[/link], [link]21-24[/link]). If we as God's people would remain in His presence in fellowship with Him, we must sanctify ourselves and everything related to us ([link]vv. 10[/link], [link]14[/link], [link]22[/link]; cf. [link]Heb. 12:14[/link]). To be sanctified is to honor the boundary of God's holiness. Sanctification is the experiential aspect of holiness. When God's holiness becomes our experience, that is sanctification. See notes [link]14[sup]1[/sup] in Heb. 12[/link] and [link]19[sup]2[/sup] in Rom. 6[/link].</note>

The law of God reveals God's attributes, showing that He is jealous ([link]vv. 4-6[/link]; cf. [link]2 Cor. 11:2[/link]), holy ([link]vv. 7-11[/link]), loving ([link]vv. 6[/link], [link]12-15[/link]; cf.

        <note num="1">The number one thousand denotes fullness (cf. [link]Psa. 84:10[/link]). To enjoy God's lovingkindness to the fullest is to enjoy it for eternity. Although God's anger can be counted ([link]v. 5[/link]), His lovingkindness is beyond counting.</note>
        <note num="2">The mentioning of love here indicates that God's intention in giving His law to His chosen people was that they become His lovers ([link]Deut. 6:5[/link]; [link]Matt. 22:35-38[/link]; [link]Mark 12:28-30[/link]). In bringing His people out of Egypt and giving His law to them, God was courting them, wooing them, and seeking to win their affection. [link]Jeremiah 2:2[/link]; [link]31:32[/link]; and [link]Ezekiel 16:8[/link] indicate that the covenant enacted at the mountain of God through the giving of the law ([link]24:7-8[/link]; [link]34:27-28[/link]) was an engagement covenant, in which God betrothed the children of Israel to Himself (cf. [link]2 Cor. 11:2[/link]). The Ten Commandments, especially the first five, gave the terms of the engagement between God and His people. The highest function of the law is to bring God's chosen people into oneness with Him, as a wife is brought into oneness with her husband (cf. [link]Gen. 2:24[/link]; [link]Rev. 22:17[/link]). In order for God and His people to be one, there must be a mutual love between them ([link]John 14:21[/link], [link]23[/link]). The love between God and His people unfolded in the Bible is primarily like the affectionate love between a man and a woman ([link]Jer. 2:2[/link]; [link]31:3[/link]). As God's people love God and spend time to fellowship with Him in His word, God infuses them with His divine element, making them one with Him as His spouse, the same as He is in life, nature, and expression ([link]Gen. 2:18-25[/link] and notes). See note [link]8[sup]1[/sup], pars. 2 and 3, in ch. 19[/link].[br][br]The entire Bible is a divine romance, a record of how God courts His chosen people and eventually marries them ([link]Gen. 2:21-24[/link]; [link]S.S. 1:2-4[/link]; [link]Isa. 54:5[/link]; [link]62:5[/link]; [link]Jer. 2:2[/link]; [link]3:1[/link], [link]14[/link]; [link]31:32[/link]; [link]Ezek. 16:8[/link]; [link]23:5[/link]; [link]Hosea 2:7[/link], [link]19[/link]; [link]Matt. 9:15[/link]; [link]John 3:29[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 11:2[/link]; [link]Eph. 5:25-32[/link]; [link]Rev. 19:7[/link]; [link]21:2[/link], [link]9-10[/link]; [link]22:17[/link]). When we as God's people enter into a love relationship with God, we receive His life, just as Eve received the life of Adam ([link]Gen. 2:21-22[/link]). It is this life that enables us to become one with God and makes Him one with us. We keep the law not by exercising our mind and will (cf. [link]Rom. 7:18-25[/link]) but by loving the Lord as our Husband and thereby partaking of His life and nature to become one with Him as His enlargement and expression.</note>

        <note num="1">The altar and the sacrifices for the worship of God provide a gateway for fallen man to enter into the economy of God. They indicate that in order to worship God, fallen man must be redeemed and terminated by the cross and replaced by Christ in resurrection. The worship God desires is through the altar and by the sacrifices, i.e., through the cross ([link]Heb. 13:10[/link]) and by Christ as the reality of the sacrifices ([link]Heb. 10:5-10[/link]). A true worshipper is one who worships God in the virtue of Christ as the burnt offering ([link]Lev. 1[/link]) for God's satisfaction and the peace offering ([link]Lev. 3[/link]) for the mutual satisfaction with God and with his fellow worshippers ([link]John 4:23-24[/link] and note [link]24[sup]4[/sup][/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">According to [link]vv. 24-26[/link], the altar God requires for His worship is primitive and uncultured in the eyes of man and offers no place for man's wisdom and power ([link]1 Cor. 1:17-25[/link]). It was to be erected with materials created by God, either earth or unhewn stone ([link]v. 25[/link]). This indicates that the cross has been prepared entirely by the work of God, with no place given to man's work. Thus, to erect an altar in this way means to receive what God has prepared, with no human work added. An altar made of earth or stone also points to the availability of the cross.</note>

        <note num="1">To add man's work to the worship of God is to bring in pollution. Because fallen man himself is sin, pollution, in the eyes of God ([link]Psa. 51:5[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 5:21[/link]), no work of man is acceptable to Him (cf. [link]Gen. 4:3-5[/link]; [link]Gal. 2:16[/link]). Thus, every fallen man who worships God must be terminated, with all his works and ways.</note>

        <note num="1">Steps refer to man's way, which promotes achievement by natural ability and creates different levels of attainment among God's people. The altar (cross) prepared by God is not elevated but is close to the ground, eliminating the need for steps and making it possible for anyone to approach it.</note>
        <note num="2">Man's nakedness denotes the shame of fallen man ([link]Gen. 3:7[/link]). God's salvation clothes man with Christ as his righteousness ([link]Gen. 3:21[/link]; [link]Luke 15:22[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 1:30[/link]; [link]Phil. 3:9[/link]), but man's way uncovers the nakedness of his fallen nature. In principle, the exercise of man's wisdom in building an altar with steps puts Christ aside and causes man's fallen nature to be exposed. Instead of exercising our wisdom in things pertaining to God, we should fully trust in Christ and thereby remain under Christ as our covering.</note>

        <note num="1">The first ordinance concerning man's relationship with others is an ordinance concerning a master and his slave.

In the Old Testament type the firstfruits signify the resurrected Christ ([link]1 Cor. 15:20[/link], [link]23[/link] and note [link]20[sup]2[/sup][/link]) offered to God on the day of His resurrection ([link]John 20:17[/link]), typified in [link]Lev. 23:10-11[/link] by the firstfruits offered to God on the day after the Sabbath, the day of resurrection ([link]Matt. 28:1[/link]). The day of Pentecost was exactly fifty days from the day of Christ's resurrection. On the day of Pentecost, the Spirit as the full issue of the resurrected Christ was poured out on the church ([link]Acts 2:1-4[/link]). This indicates that the resurrected Christ became the Spirit poured out on His believers for their full enjoyment ([link]1 Cor. 15:45[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 3:17[/link]).

        <note num="1">The various pagan tribes that occupied the land signify the different aspects of our natural life. The gods (idols) of the pagan tribes ([link]v. 24[/link]), with the demons behind them (cf. [link]1 Cor. 10:20[/link]), represent the spiritual forces of evil ([link]Eph. 6:12[/link]). Behind our natural life are the forces of evil (cf. [link]Matt. 16:23[/link] and note 1), who utilize, manipulate, and direct the aspects of our natural life to frustrate us from taking possession of the all-inclusive Christ and enjoying His riches.[br][br]History shows that the pagan tribes in the land were the source of Israel's sin against God (cf. [link]v. 33[/link]). This indicates that our natural life is the source of our sins. In the sight of God, those who live according to the natural life are sinning continually, whether they do good or evil. Because the natural life frustrates us from possessing Christ and enjoying Him, we must hate it ([link]Luke 14:26[/link]) and, as we grow in Christ, be willing to drive it out.

        <note num="1">Although the law had been decreed on the mountain of God, there was still the need for the law with its ordinances to be enacted as a covenant.

[link]Heb. 9:18-20[/link]). The altar, symbolizing the cross of Christ ([link]Heb. 13:10[/link]), indicates that as fallen and sinful people, we cannot possibly keep the law of God; hence, we need to be redeemed, terminated, and replaced by Christ through the cross.</note>
        <note num="2">A pillar signifies a testimony (cf. [link]1 Kings 7:21[/link]; [link]1 Tim. 3:15[/link]). The twelve pillars, representing the twelve tribes of Israel, indicate that in the sight of God the twelve tribes should be pillars as a testimony of God, a reflection of what God is in His virtues and attributes as portrayed in the law. The law was not given for God's people to keep or observe; it was given that the people might become God's testimony by being redeemed, terminated, replaced, and reconstituted by Christ through the cross (cf.

        <note num="2">In [link]vv. 6[/link] and [link]8[/link] the blood from the sacrifices offered on the altar ([link]v. 5[/link]), typifying the blood of Christ, was for redemption and for the forgiveness and cleansing of sins ([link]Eph. 1:7[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 1:18-19[/link]; [link]Matt. 26:28[/link]; [link]Heb. 9:22[/link]; [link]1 John 1:7[/link], [link]9[/link]). This blood also enacted the covenant between God and His people. Hence, the blood is referred to here as "the blood of the covenant." The blood made it possible for God's people, as fallen and sinful persons who had been redeemed, forgiven, and cleansed, to enter into God's presence, i.e., into God Himself, and remain there to be infused with Him and thereby be constituted pillars as a living testimony, a living portrait, of what God is ([link]vv. 9-18[/link]; [link]34:28-29[/link]; [link]Lev. 16:11-16[/link]; cf. [link]Heb. 10:19-20[/link]). Eventually, the blood of Christ as the blood of the new covenant ([link]Matt. 26:28[/link]; [link]Luke 22:20[/link]) ushers God's people into the better things of the new covenant, in which God gives His people a new heart, a new spirit, His Spirit, and the inner law of life, denoting God Himself with His nature, life, attributes, and virtues ([link]Jer. 31:33-34[/link]; [link]Ezek. 36:26-27[/link]; [link]Heb. 8:10-12[/link]).

        <note num="1">The law of God comprises the moral law ([link]Exo. 20-23[/link]) and the ceremonial law ([link]Exo. 25[/link]-[link]Lev. 27[/link]). The moral law, as God's testimony based on His divine attributes, is composed of the Ten Commandments ([link]20:2-17[/link]), the statutes ([link]20:22-26[/link]), and the ordinances ([link]21:1-23:19[/link]) and typifies Christ as God's testimony, God's expression (see note [link]1[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 20[/link]). The ceremonial law was composed of the laws of the tabernacle, the offerings, the priesthood, and the feasts. The tabernacle typifies Christ as the embodiment of God ([link]Col. 2:9[/link]; [link]John 1:14[/link]) for God's people to contact Him and to enter into Him for their enjoyment; the offerings typify Christ as all kinds of sacrifices ([link]Lev. 1-7[/link]; [link]Heb. 10:5-12[/link]) to meet the need of God toward His people and the need of His people before Him; the priesthood typifies Christ as the High Priest ([link]Heb. 8:1[/link]), who takes care of God's chosen people before God; and the feasts typify Christ as the bountiful enjoyment in every aspect assigned by God to His chosen people ([link]Col. 2:16-17[/link]; [link]Phil. 1:19[/link]).[br][br]God knew that no man could keep the Ten Commandments, the moral section of His law, to be justified by Him ([link]Rom. 3:20[/link]). Hence, by His grace and according to His economy He also gave His people the ceremonial section of His law that through the priesthood and the offerings the condemned sinners, the breakers of the moral law of God, could be saved from the condemnation under the moral law and could contact God and enter into Him to enjoy Him as their everything. In this way sinners could be justified by God to be righteous men (cf. [link]Matt. 1:19a[/link]; [link]Luke 1:6[/link], [link]75[/link]; [link]2:25[/link]; [link]23:50[/link]) and could have fellowship with God.[br][br]The entire law of God was decreed by God to His people with the intention of exposing and convicting His people by the moral section of His law, that they would be conducted to the ceremonial section of His law, signifying that God's people should be conducted to the all-inclusive Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God for their redemption, salvation, and bountiful enjoyment in every aspect ([link]Gal. 3:23-24[/link]) through all the ages unto eternity.</note>

        <note num="1">To heave is to lift up. The heave offering typifies the uplifted Christ, the Christ who was lifted up in His ascension ([link]Acts 1:9[/link]); it was often accompanied by the wave offering, a type of the resurrected Christ ([link]29:26-28[/link]; [link]Lev. 7:30-32[/link]; [link]Num. 18:11[/link]). The fact that the materials for the building of the tabernacle were offered to God by His people as a heave offering signifies that the church is built up not with any natural materials but with the very Christ who has been gained, possessed, enjoyed, and experienced by God's people in resurrection and in the heavenlies ([link]Phil. 3:7-14[/link]; [link]Eph. 3:8[/link]; [link]2:5-6[/link]). Cf. [link]1 Cor. 3:12[/link] and notes.[br][br]All the materials for the building of the tabernacle signify the virtues of Christ's person and work. Twelve kinds of materials were used, in three categories: minerals, signifying Christ's building life ([link]1 Cor. 3:9-12[/link]); plants, signifying Christ's generating life ([link]John 12:24[/link]); and animals, signifying Christ's redeeming life ([link]John 1:29[/link]). The redeeming life is for the generating life, and the generating life is for the building life. The fact that minerals were mentioned as the first category indicates that whatever Christ is and whatever He has done and is doing are all for God's building ([link]Matt. 16:18[/link]). In the New Jerusalem, the ultimate consummation of God's building, there will be only minerals: gold, pearl, and precious stones ([link]Rev. 21:18-21[/link]). However, in order to arrive at God's goal, the redeeming life and the generating life are needed.</note>

At the beginning of the New Testament age the incarnated Christ as God's embodiment was both the tabernacle and the temple of God ([link]John 1:14[/link]; [link]2:19-21[/link]). Through His death and resurrection the individual Christ was enlarged to be the corporate Christ, the church composed of the New Testament believers as the temple, the house of God, and the Body of Christ ([link]1 Cor. 3:16-17[/link]; [link]1 Tim. 3:15[/link]; [link]Heb. 3:6[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 12:12[/link]).

        <note num="1">Because the law, God's testimony (see note [link]1[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 20[/link]), was placed in the Ark ([link]vv. 16[/link], [link]21[/link]; [link]Deut. 10:1-5[/link]), the Ark was called the Ark of the Testimony ([link]v. 22[/link]; [link]26:33-34[/link]); and because the Ark was in the tabernacle, the tabernacle was called the Tabernacle of the Testimony ([link]38:21[/link]; [link]Num. 1:50[/link], [link]53[/link]). As the embodiment of God's testimony, the Ark typifies Christ as the embodiment of God ([link]Col. 2:9[/link]). The Ark as a type of Christ indicates that God's redeemed people can contact God and enjoy God in Christ and through Christ (see note [link]22[sup]1[/sup][/link]; [link]John 14:6[/link]; [link]Heb. 10:19-20[/link]).[br][br]As the center and content of the tabernacle, the Ark also signifies Christ as the center and content of the church as God's tabernacle, God's house ([link]Eph. 2:21-22[/link]; [link]1 Tim. 3:15[/link]). The fact that the Ark is the item first mentioned in the vision of the tabernacle and its furniture indicates that it occupies the place of preeminence (cf. [link]Col. 1:18[/link]). It also indicates that the church, the Body of Christ, typified by the tabernacle, comes out of Christ, typified by the Ark. See note [link]15[sup]2[/sup] in ch. 26[/link] and note [link]22[sup]1[/sup] in Gen. 2[/link]. Cf. notes [link]8[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 36[/link] and [link]3[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 40[/link].</note>
        <note num="2">Acacia wood ([link]vv. 5[/link], [link]10[/link], [link]23[/link]; [link]26:15[/link]; [link]27:1[/link]) signifies Christ's human nature, strong in character and high in standard.

This implies that Christ, typified by the Ark, needs the church as His counterpart, His bride, to be a testimony in full in humanity ([link]Eph. 5:22-32[/link]; [link]3:21[/link] and notes).</note>

A ring, which has no beginning or ending, signifies the eternal Spirit ([link]Heb. 9:14[/link]; [link]Luke 15:22[/link]). The four rings of gold signify that the Spirit of Christ is the linking factor and power for bearing Christ as God's testimony.

        <note num="2">The two rings with the two poles ([link]v. 14[/link]) on the two sides of the Ark signify that the move of Christ as God's embodied testimony is through a good coordination as a testimony in every respect ([link]Luke 10:1[/link] and note 2).</note>

        <note num="1">The poles made of acacia wood signify that Christ's human nature is the strength for His move as God's testimony. Their being overlaid with gold signifies that Christ's divine nature is the expression of His move. The move of Christ is always by His two natures, human and divine, mingled as one.

[link]2 Cor. 4:10-12[/link]) in the uniting power of the Spirit ([link]Eph. 4:3[/link]). Those who bore the Ark carried it on their shoulders, indicating that they were one with the Ark. In reality, to bear the Ark is to live Christ as His testimony, His witnesses, wherever we go ([link]Acts 1:8[/link] and note 3; [link]23:11[/link] and note 4).

        <note num="1">The expiation cover, corresponding to the propitiation place in [link]Rom. 3:25[/link] and [link]Heb. 9:5[/link], was the lid of the Ark.

Thus, the expiation cover with the blood of the sacrifices sprinkled on it on the Day of Expiation ([link]Lev. 16:14-15[/link], [link]29-30[/link]) portrays the redeeming Christ in His humanity and the shining Christ in His divinity as the place where fallen sinners can meet with the righteous, holy, and glorious God and hear His word, thereby being infused with God as grace and receiving vision, revelation, and instruction from Him.

        <note num="1">The table of the bread of the Presence signifies Christ as the nourishing feast for the believers as God's priests ([link]1 Pet. 2:5[/link], [link]9[/link]; [link]Rev. 1:6[/link]; [link]5:10[/link]). This table was set up in the Holy Place within the tabernacle ([link]40:22[/link]; [link]Heb. 9:2[/link]), signifying within, or among, God's people as His builded habitation (see note [link]15[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 26[/link]). In the Bible a table signifies not an individual feasting but a corporate feasting ([link]1 Cor. 10:16[/link], [link]21[/link]; cf. [link]Psa. 23:5[/link]). Christ as the food of God's priests is for a corporate feasting within God's dwelling place.[br][br]In the sequence of God's revelation, the table comes after the Ark ([link]vv. 10-22[/link]), implying that the table is connected to the Ark. In spiritual experience, when we meet with God upon Christ as the propitiation cover, enjoying fellowship with God and hearing words from His mouth, the Ark becomes the table of the bread of the Presence, where we enjoy a nourishing feast. This means that Christ, the embodiment of God's testimony, issues in our enjoyment of Him. Furthermore, in our experience, our enjoyment of Christ always brings us back to Him as God's testimony.</note>
        <note num="2">Acacia wood here signifies that Christ's humanity is the basic element for Him to be our feast ([link]John 6:51[/link], [link]53-55[/link]). The gold that overlaid the wood signifies Christ's divinity as the expression of God. As we enjoy Christ as the supply by which we serve God, the outcome will be gold &amp;#8212; Christ's divinity as the expression of God.</note>
        <note num="3">In length and width the table was two square cubits, which is composed of two units, each of one square cubit, signifying the perfect (signified by a square) and complete (signified by the number one) life supply of Christ issuing in a testimony (signified by the number two).</note>
        <note num="4">The height of the table was the same as that of the Ark of the Testimony, signifying that the nourishment of Christ as the supply of the serving priests matches the standard of God's testimony (cf. note [link]34[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 16[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">The frame was near the bottom of the table, close to the rings put on the four corners at the feet of the table ([link]vv. 26-27[/link]). Its purpose was to connect the legs and strengthen them, the handbreadth signifying its being full of strength to connect and strengthen. The rim of gold on the frame is for keeping and holding (see note [link]11[sup]2[/sup][/link]). In spiritual experience, the enjoyment of Christ as a feast strengthens us, connects us, upholds us, and keeps us.</note>

        <note num="1">As with the Ark, the four rings on the table signify the Spirit of Christ as the linking factor and power (see note [link]12[sup]1[/sup][/link]). The oneness of the Spirit as a ring is a uniting bond with binding power ([link]Eph. 4:3[/link]). That the four rings were put on the four feet of the table signifies that Christ as our feast moves and follows us (cf. [link]1 Cor. 10:4[/link]).

        <note num="1">The plates were for displaying the bread. The cups contained frankincense (signifying Christ's resurrection), which was poured on the bread of the Presence displayed on the table ([link]Lev. 24:7[/link]). The pitchers and bowls were used for pouring out drink offerings. That all the utensils were made of pure gold signifies that the divine nature of Christ is the means through which we partake of Him as our life supply and our offering to God.</note>

        <text>And you shall set the [note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]bread of the [note]2[/note]Presence upon the table before Me always.</text>
        <note num="1">The bread on the table is called the bread of the Presence because the table was set before God, i.e., in God's presence, not far from the Ark. Whereas manna was gathered by all the people in the wilderness outside the court of the tabernacle, the bread of God's presence was enjoyed only by the priests in the presence of God in the Holy Place within the tabernacle ([link]40:22-23[/link]; [link]Heb. 9:2[/link]; [link]Lev. 24:9[/link]). Manna typifies Christ as the life supply of God's people for their living (see note [link]19[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 16[/link]); the bread on the table typifies Christ as the life supply of God's priests, enabling them not only to live but also to serve God. This bread indicates that God's people should no longer live by themselves but by Christ as their life and life supply ([link]John 6:57[/link]).[br][br]The bread of the Presence was the most holy of Jehovah's offerings by fire ([link]Lev. 24:7[/link], [link]9[/link]). It signifies the surplus of the believers' enjoyment of Christ that is offered to God to be His food for His satisfaction. God caused certain loaves of this offering to be spared, brought into the Holy Place, and arranged and displayed on the table to be food for the serving priests.</note>
        <note num="2">Or, Face. The bread of the Presence, the face-bread, means that God's presence, God's face, is the life supply to the serving priests (cf. [link]2 Cor. 2:10[/link]; [link]4:6-7[/link]; [link]3:18[/link]). In our experience the reality of God's presence is the Spirit in our spirit ([link]2 Tim. 4:22[/link]; cf. [link]2 Cor. 3:17[/link]), who is also the reality of Christ as the bread of life ([link]John 6:33[/link], [link]51a[/link], [link]63[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">As described in [link]vv. 31-36[/link], the lampstand consisted of a base, a central stalk, and three branches on each of its two sides. Underneath each pair of branches there was a calyx, which held two branches at the stalk. On each branch there were three cups shaped like almond blossoms, each cup being composed of a calyx (the leafy green bottom of the blossom) and a blossoming bud. The whole flower, including the calyx and the blossom, was a cup shaped like an almond blossom. On the lampstand there were twenty-five calyxes &amp;#8212; one at the base of each pair of branches, three on each of the six branches, and four on the shaft &amp;#8212; and twenty-two blossoms (the three calyxes at the base of each pair of branches did not have blossoms). The divine thought here is that the lampstand is actually a living and growing tree with calyxes and blossoms.[br][br]The lampstand signifies the Triune God embodied and expressed. Pure gold as the substance of the lampstand ([link]v. 31[/link]) signifies God the Father in His divine nature; the form of the lampstand signifies God the Son as the embodiment of God the Father ([link]John 14:9-11a[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 4:4b[/link]; [link]Col. 1:15[/link]; [link]2:9[/link]); and the seven lamps ([link]v. 37[/link]) signify God the Spirit being the seven Spirits of God for the sevenfold intensified expression of the Father in the Son ([link]Rev. 4:5[/link]; [link]5:6[/link]). The lampstand in this chapter signifies Christ as the embodiment and expression of the Triune God shining with the seven lamps, the seven Spirits of God ([link]Col. 2:9[/link]; [link]Matt. 4:16[/link]; [link]John 1:4-9[/link]); the lampstand in [link]1 Kings 7:49[/link] signifies the enlarged Christ; the lampstand in [link]Zech. 4[/link] signifies the nation of Israel as God's shining testimony with the sevenfold intensified life-giving Spirit as the reality of Christ ([link]Zech. 4:2[/link], [link]6[/link], [link]10[/link]; [link]Rev. 5:6[/link]); and the lampstands in [link]Rev. 1[/link] signify the local churches as the reproduction of Christ and the reprint of the Spirit ([link]Rev. 1:11-12[/link], [link]20[/link]). The consummation and aggregate of all the lampstands in the Scriptures is the New Jerusalem, the ultimate, unique, and eternal golden lampstand, with Christ as the lamp and God as the light shining within Him and through the city for the expression of the Triune God in eternity ([link]Rev. 21:11[/link], [link]18[/link], [link]23[/link]; [link]22:5[/link]). See note [link]12[sup]3[/sup] in Rev. 1[/link].[br][br]That the lampstand is revealed after the table of the bread of the Presence ([link]vv. 23-30[/link]) indicates that Christ as the supply of life, signified by the table, becomes the light of life to us ([link]John 1:4[/link]; [link]8:12[/link]), signified by the lampstand. The placing of the lampstand in the Holy Place opposite the table and near the Ark ([link]26:34-35[/link]) indicates that in the church the light of the truth ([link]1 John 1:5-6[/link]) and the supply of life must match and balance each other for the carrying on of Christ as God's testimony. In the making and displaying of the furniture of the tabernacle, the lampstand was followed by the incense altar ([link]37:23-25[/link]; [link]40:24-27[/link]), indicating that the shining of Christ in resurrection as the divine light leads us to enjoy Christ as the fragrant incense of resurrection in the prayer of fellowship with God. The light from the lampstand directs us to enjoy Christ as our life supply and also guides us into the Holy of Holies to enjoy Christ in the deepest way as the testimony of God with the throne of grace (see notes [link]10[sup]1[/sup][/link] and [link]17[sup]1[/sup][/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">Pure gold, signifying the pure divine nature, indicates that as the embodiment of God the Father for His expression, Christ is purely divine. Although as a man Christ has humanity, His shining as the light of life ([link]John 8:12[/link]) is related not to His humanity but to His divinity ([link]John 1:1[/link], [link]4-5[/link]). The same is true of the church as the lampstand ([link]Rev. 1:20[/link]) &amp;#8212; the actuality and the shining of the church depend not on humanity but on how much of the divine element has been infused and wrought into the church ([link]2 Pet. 1:4[/link]).</note>
        <note num="3">The base for stability and the shaft for strength signify that the Lord Jesus was always stable and strong ([link]Matt. 8:24-26[/link]; [link]Luke 4:29-30[/link]).</note>
        <note num="4">The beating of the gold to shine forth the light signifies that Christ's shining of the divine light as the expression of the divine glory ([link]Rev. 21:23[/link]) is through sufferings (cf. note [link]18[sup]1[/sup][/link]), through which Christ was constituted as the divine light-holder to shine in God's dwelling place so that God's serving ones could serve there. The beating of the gold to form a stand also signifies the believers' participation in Christ's sufferings and their being blended together through the cross and by the Spirit for the producing and building up of the church, the Body of Christ ([link]Rom. 8:17[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 2:21[/link]; [link]Phil. 3:10[/link]; [link]Col. 1:24[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 12:24[/link]).</note>
        <note num="5">A cup, equal to a complete flower, consists of a calyx (the outer leafy green layer of a flower) and a blossom bud, which is actually the flower itself ([link]vv. 33-34[/link]). The cups shaped like almond blossoms signify the resurrection life blossoming ([link]Num. 17:8[/link]). To shine the divine light is to blossom. This indicates that Christ's being the light of life and our shining forth the light of life as the church are in resurrection (cf. note [link]32[sup]1[/sup][/link]). The calyxes containing the blossom buds signify the resurrection life as a container to sustain and support our shining forth of the divine light. The blossom buds signify the expression of the resurrection life.</note>

        <text>And a [note]1[/note]calyx under two branches of [i]one piece with[/i] it, and a calyx under two branches of [i]one piece with[/i] it, and a calyx under two branches of [i]one piece with[/i] it, for the [note]2[/note]six branches going out of the lampstand.</text>
        <note num="1">According to the description given in this chapter, in the divine thought the golden lampstand is actually a living and growing tree with calyxes and blossoms (see note [link]31[sup]1[/sup][/link], par. 1). Thus, the lampstand portrays the Triune God embodied in Christ as a living tree, growing, branching, budding, and blossoming to shine the light for His full expression. The calyx under each pair of branches signifies life branching out by growing to produce the shining. The repetition in this verse related to the calyxes and the branches also indicates growth. As the central shaft, or stalk, of the lampstand grows upward, it produces three pairs of branches, and as the branches grow out, calyxes, buds, and blossoms appear on the branches ([link]v. 33[/link]). The light of the lampstand is the blossoming of the resurrection life ([link]John 1:4[/link]; [link]Gal. 5:22[/link]; [link]Eph. 5:9[/link]), and the shining of the light is the issue of the growing, branching, budding, and blossoming. That there are twenty-five calyxes and twenty-two blossoms indicates that with the lampstand the responsibility for growth is greater than the matter of budding, blossoming, and shining.</note>
        <note num="2">Six is the number of man, since man was created on the sixth day ([link]Gen. 1:26[/link]). Here the number six is composed of three plus three, three signifying the Triune God in resurrection. Hence, the six branches signify the believers in Christ as created men who are in the Triune God in resurrection. The picture of the lampstand indicates that Christ as the resurrection life is growing, branching, budding, and blossoming both in Himself as the central stalk and in His believers as His branches ([link]John 15:5a[/link]; [link]Col. 2:19[/link]) to shine the divine light for the expression of the Triune God.</note>

        <note num="1">The seven lamps of the lampstand signify the seven Spirits of God ([link]Rev. 4:5[/link]) as the seven eyes of Jehovah ([link]Zech. 4:10[/link]), the seven eyes of the redeeming Lamb ([link]Rev. 5:6[/link]), and the seven eyes of the building stone ([link]Zech. 3:9[/link]) for the full expression of the Triune God. See notes [link]10[sup]1[/sup] in Zech. 4[/link], [link]5[sup]1[/sup] in Rev. 4[/link], [link]6[sup]5[/sup] in Rev. 5[/link], and [link]14[sup]3[/sup] in Rev. 1[/link].</note>
        <note num="2">In the three parts of the tabernacle there were three kinds of light. The light in the outer court was the natural light, the light of the sun, the moon, and the stars. The light in the Holy Place was the inner light, the light of the lampstand, signifying God in Christ shining in resurrection and in the Spirit. The light in the Holy of Holies was the innermost light, God appearing in His shekinah glory on the expiation cover, which typifies Christ as the place of propitiation ([link]v. 22[/link]; [link]40:34[/link]; cf. [link]Rev. 21:23[/link]; [link]22:5[/link]). Eventually, through our enjoyment of Christ in the Holy of Holies the shining light of the lampstand is replaced by and becomes the shekinah glory of God for our closest fellowship with God ([link]2 Cor. 3:18[/link]; [link]4:6[/link]).</note>

[link]2 Cor. 4:17[/link]; [link]1 Tim. 2:2[/link]). The measurements of the lampstand are not given, signifying that the divinity of Christ and the light He shines are immeasurable (cf.

        <note num="1">The covering of the tabernacle consisted of four layers. The first and innermost layer ([link]vv. 1-6[/link]), referred to here as the tabernacle, consisted of ten curtains of fine twined linen and blue and purple and scarlet strands. The number ten signifies human perfection and completeness (see note [link]10[sup]2[/sup] in Rev. 2[/link]), and the fine linen curtains typify Christ's fine humanity. Hence, the first layer of covering typifies Christ as a fine, perfect, and complete man without defect, shortage, or excess ([link]John 19:4[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 5:21[/link]; [link]Heb. 4:15[/link]; [link]7:26[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 2:22[/link]). This layer was not only a covering but also a protection for the standing boards and all the contents of the tabernacle, signifying that the humanity of the Lord Jesus covers, protects, and embraces all His believers as the church. The first layer of covering, forming the ceiling of the tabernacle, is the inward expression of the beauty and glory of the Lord Jesus in His humanity.</note>
        <note num="2">Fine linen signifies righteous conduct ([link]Rev. 19:8[/link]). Fineness signifies evenness, and being twined here signifies being dealt with through sufferings and, hence, not loose. Fine twined linen signifies the fine living of Christ manifested through suffering and trials.</note>

Here the cherubim embroidered on the linen curtains signify God's glory manifested in Jesus as a man, a creature ([link]John 1:14[/link]; [link]Col. 1:15[/link]). That the number of the cherubim is not given indicates that God's glory manifested in His creature is immeasurable (cf. notes [link book="Exo." chapter="25"]19[sup]1[/sup][/link] and [link]39[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 25[/link]).</note>
        <note num="5">The skillful workman, the embroiderer, here signifies the Holy Spirit, and the embroidering of the cherubim on the curtains signifies the constituting work of the Holy Spirit in the Lord Jesus to make the glory of God manifested in the creature.

        <note num="1">Five is the number of responsibility (cf. note [link]2[sup]1[/sup] in Matt. 25[/link]), and two is the number of testimony ([link]Deut. 19:15[/link]). The two sets of the five curtains joined to one another ([link]vv. 4-6[/link]) signify the continuous life of the Lord Jesus as a life of responsibility for a testimony.[br][br]The joining of the two sets of five curtains resulted in a large sheet measuring forty cubits by twenty-eight cubits. Twenty-eight is composed of four times seven, the number four signifying man as God's creature ([link]Ezek. 1:5[/link]) and the number seven signifying completion (see note [link]4[sup]1[/sup] in Rev. 1[/link]). Thus, the length of each curtain also signifies the completeness and perfection of the Lord Jesus as a man (cf. note [link]1[sup]1[/sup][/link]). The number forty signifies testing and trials ([link]Heb. 3:9[/link]; [link]Matt. 4:2[/link]). Hence, the forty cubits signify that the Lord's completeness and perfection as a man have been tested, and He is approved by both God and man.[br][br]The tabernacle itself was thirty cubits in length and ten cubits in both width and height (see notes [link]18[sup]1[/sup][/link] and [link]33[sup]1[/sup][/link]). When the tabernacle was erected, the sheet of linen curtains was spread upon the standing boards ([link]vv. 15-30[/link]). The sheet hung over the rear of the tabernacle by ten cubits and over the sides by nine cubits each, with no overhang at the front, the entrance, of the tabernacle. The number nine, composed of three times three, signifies the Triune God in resurrection. The overhang of nine cubits on each side signifies that the Lord Jesus was a perfect and complete man overflowing with the Triune God in resurrection in an even and balanced way.</note>

        <note num="1">Loops signify availability for joining. That the loops were on the edge of the outermost curtain in each of the two sets of five curtains indicates that they were the issue of a life of responsibility for a testimony (see note [link]3[sup]1[/sup][/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">See note [link]4[sup]3[/sup] in ch. 25[/link]. The second layer of covering typifies Christ as the One who was made sin for us ([link]2 Cor. 5:21[/link]) and who died on the cross for our sins ([link]1 Cor. 15:3[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 2:24[/link]; [link]3:18[/link]). The first two layers of covering together signify that the Lord Jesus, the perfect man, was made sin in the eyes of God for our redemption.</note>
        <note num="2">In [link]v. 1[/link] the first layer of the covering of the tabernacle is itself called the tabernacle, and here the curtain of goats' hair is a tent to cover and protect the tabernacle.</note>

        <note num="1">As a perfect man, Christ is heavenly, but when He was made sin for us, He was not heavenly. Thus, the loops on the second layer are not said to be blue (cf. [link]v. 4[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">The clasps signify joining power, and bronze signifies God's judgment ([link]Num. 16:39[/link]; [link]21:8-9[/link]). The joining of the tent by the bronze clasps signifies that God's righteous judgment holds together the judged and tried Christ as a complete person.</note>

        <note num="1">The joining of the curtains in the second layer resulted in a rectangle measuring forty-four cubits by thirty cubits. This layer of goats' hair was laid over the tabernacle in such a way that it hung over the back and the two sides ([link]vv. 12-13[/link]), completely covering the standing boards and the linen curtains. According to [link]v. 9[/link] the sixth curtain was doubled over at the front of the tent for protection and strengthening. The hanging over of the tent at the back and on the two sides of the tabernacle indicates that after Christ was made sin and was judged by God for sinners, He became the covering and protection of the believers, who are the components of God's dwelling place (see note [link]15[sup]1[/sup][/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">The overhang of the tent on each of the two sides of the tabernacle was one cubit longer than that of the linen curtains ([link]v. 8a[/link], cf. [link]v. 2a[/link]). Hence, the linen curtains were fully protected by the tent of goats' hair. The overhang on the two sides signifies the redeeming Christ becoming the protection of God's dwelling place in any situation, whether hardship (the north side &amp;#8212; [link]v. 20[/link]) or ease (the south side &amp;#8212; [link]v. 18[/link]) (cf.

        <note num="1">See note [link]5[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 25[/link]. The third layer of covering typifies Christ as the One who accomplished redemption by dying and shedding His blood to meet God's need and ours ([link]Heb. 9:12-14[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 1:18-19[/link]; [link]Col. 1:14[/link]). Rams are males and signify Christ as a strong man who died for our redemption.[br][br]The first three layers of covering signify that because the perfect man (the first layer, the fine linen), Jesus Christ, was made sin for us (the second layer, the goats' hair) as our Substitute, redemption has been accomplished (the third layer, the ram's skins dyed red). Christ's full and complete redemption, which is Christ Himself, covers God's chosen and redeemed people, who are His dwelling place.</note>
        <note num="2">See note [link]5[sup]2[/sup] in ch. 25[/link]. The fourth layer of covering, the porpoise skins, signifies that Christ is without comeliness or beauty ([link]Isa. 53:2[/link]). The covering of porpoise skins protected the tabernacle from storms and rain, signifying that Christ as our covering enables us to stand against Satan and all his attacks.</note>

        <note num="1">The walls of the tabernacle, composed of standing boards, typify the believers built together to be the dwelling place of God ([link]Eph. 2:22[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 2:5[/link]). Thus, the church, the corporate Christ ([link]1 Cor. 12:12[/link]), is included with the individual Christ in the type of the tabernacle (see note [link]9[sup]2[/sup] in ch. 25[/link]). In the picture of the tabernacle the corporate Christ is covered by the individual Christ (cf. [link]2 Cor. 12:9[/link]). The fact that the covering of the tabernacle is revealed in Exodus before the boards indicates that Christ's redemption had to take place before the church could come into existence.</note>
        <note num="2">The boards were made of acacia wood overlaid with gold ([link]v. 29[/link]), the same materials used to make the Ark ([link]25:10-11[/link]). This indicates that the boards are the enlargement and extension of the Ark. In the same way the believers in Christ, typified by the boards, are the enlargement and extension of Christ as God's testimony ([link]John 12:23-24[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 10:1[/link]; [link]Phil. 1:8[/link], [link]20-21a[/link]). Through regeneration the believers have received the uplifted humanity of Jesus and His overlaying divine nature to become boards of acacia wood overlaid with gold. The overlaying of the acacia wood with gold signifies that the divine nature of Christ has become one with the believers' human nature to be the expression of God.</note>

The two tenons, which fit into the two sockets under each board, may signify our complete faith in Christ's redemption, which gives us a firm and unshakable standing ([link]2 Cor. 1:24[/link]; [link]Rom. 5:2[/link]; [link]Gal. 5:1[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">A corner is where a turn is made. The doubling of the corner boards ([link]v. 23[/link]) signifies that at each turn in the Lord's move there is a need for doubling, strengthening, reinforcing. For example, at Antioch there was a turn toward the Gentile world; for this Barnabas and Saul were doubled and strengthened to become corner boards for the building of the church ([link]Acts 13:2[/link], [link]46[/link]).</note>

Six refers to man created on the sixth day, who became fallen and was later redeemed, and eight refers to resurrection, which occurred on the eighth day, the first day of a new week ([link]John 20:1[/link]).

They signify the initial Spirit (see note [link]29[sup]2[/sup][/link]) becoming the uniting Spirit to join all the members of Christ into one Body ([link]Eph. 4:3-4[/link]). The boards stand in silver, signifying Christ's redemptive work, and they are united by gold, signifying Christ's divine person. That the bars were made of acacia wood indicates that the oneness of the Spirit involves not only Christ's divinity but also His humanity ([link]Eph. 4:2[/link] and note). In actuality, the uniting bars signify not the Holy Spirit alone, but the Holy Spirit mingled with our human spirit ([link]Rom. 8:16[/link]) &amp;#8212; the mingled spirit, which includes both divinity and humanity.</note>

Hence, the five bars formed three lines, indicating that there were three rings on each board to serve as holders for the bars.[br][br]The uniting of the boards of the tabernacle involved the passing of the bars through the rings on each board to join the boards together. This signifies that the believers in Christ are united when their spirit cooperates with the Spirit, thus allowing the uniting Spirit to pass through them to join them to other believers.</note>

        <note num="1">In order to become one entity as God's dwelling place, the forty-eight boards in the tabernacle had to be united in oneness. The oneness of the boards of the tabernacle was not in the acacia wood but in the gold that overlaid the wood. Gold signifies the Triune God with His divine nature, and the shining of the gold signifies the glory of God. The oneness of the boards in the overlaying gold symbolizes the oneness of the believers in the Triune God and in His glory, His expression. This is the practical oneness for which the Lord prayed in [link]John 17:21-23[/link]. This oneness is the building up of the believers to be God's dwelling place (cf.

The veil, signifying the flesh of Christ ([link]Heb. 10:20[/link]), separated the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies ([link]v. 33[/link]) and also covered the Ark of the Testimony ([link]Num. 4:5[/link]). This signifies the separation between God and fallen man because of man's flesh ([link]Gen. 6:3[/link]; cf. [link]Gen. 3:22-24[/link] and notes). This veil was torn through Christ's crucifixion, signifying that the flesh of sin was crucified through Christ's death on the cross to open a new and living way for sinful man to contact God on Christ as the propitiation cover in the Holy of Holies ([link]Matt. 27:51[/link] and note 1; [link]Heb. 10:19-20[/link]; [link]Rom. 3:25[/link]; cf.

        <note num="2">The pillars, like the boards, were made of acacia wood overlaid with gold and stood on silver sockets, which signify Christ's redemption. Hence, the pillars signify believers ([link]Gal. 2:9[/link]; [link]Rev. 3:12[/link]; [link]1 Tim. 3:15[/link]) who are strong to bear the testimony of Christ's incarnation and crucifixion. The veil being attached to the pillars implies the identification, the oneness, of Christ as the veil with those believers who are pillars. The pillars in God's dwelling place no longer live in the flesh but bear the testimony that the veil of their flesh has been torn, i.e., that they themselves have been terminated and their flesh has been crucified with Christ ([link]Gal. 2:20[/link]; [link]5:24[/link]). The riven veil on the pillars becomes an entrance for God's people to enter the Holy of Holies to have the full enjoyment of God. See note [link]37[sup]1[/sup][/link].</note>
        <note num="3">The hooks of gold by which the veil was connected to the pillars signify the holding and connecting strength of the divine nature, by which the stronger believers are connected to Christ to bear the testimony of His incarnation and crucifixion.</note>

Ten is the number of human completion (see note [link]10[sup]2[/sup] in Rev. 2[/link]), and one hundred, composed of ten times ten, signifies the full and complete fulfillment of the requirements of the Ten Commandments. The one hundred sockets were made from the expiation silver collected from the people ([link]30:11-16[/link]; [link]38:25[/link], [link]27[/link]), signifying that as the boards and pillars for the building up of God's dwelling place, God's redeemed people stand on the solid redemption of Christ.</note>

        <note num="1">The screen as the entrance to the tent was made of the same material as the first layer of the covering and the veil separating the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies (cf. [link]vv. 1[/link], [link]31[/link]). The screen signifies Christ in His perfect humanity as the One who keeps all negative persons and things outside God's dwelling place, and as the One who died for our sins under God's judgment ([link]1 Cor. 15:3[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 2:24[/link]; [link]3:18[/link]) so that we may be forgiven by God and may enter into the Holy Place of His dwelling to begin to enjoy all the riches of God in Christ.[br][br]The screen and the veil in the tabernacle signify two aspects of the all-inclusive death of Christ. The screen indicates that Christ died for our sins so that our sins may be forgiven and that we may be justified by God. The veil indicates that Christ died for us, the sinners ([link]2 Cor. 5:14-15[/link], [link]21[/link]), so that our flesh, our fallen nature, may be torn, crucified, that we may enter into the Holy of Holies to enjoy God to the uttermost. These two curtains are related to the two aspects of reconciliation spoken of by Paul in [link]2 Cor. 5:18-21[/link] (see note [link book="2 Cor." chapter="5"]20[sup]2[/sup][/link] there).</note>
        <note num="2">The tabernacle in Exodus was enterable. By being incarnated, God not only became a man; He also became an enterable tabernacle ([link]John 1:14[/link]). God's original intention was that all the children of Israel would be priests ([link]19:6[/link]) and have the right to enter into the tabernacle, i.e., to enter into God and dwell in God. In the Old Testament the priests could enter into the tabernacle, and today all the believers in Christ, as priests ([link]Rom. 15:16[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 2:5[/link], [link]9[/link]; [link]Rev. 1:6[/link]), can enter into God and dwell in Him ([link]1 John 4:13[/link], [link]15[/link]).

        <note num="1">Like the four pillars attached to the veil ([link]v. 32[/link]), the five pillars attached to the screen signify stronger believers who are identified with the incarnated and crucified Christ (see notes [link]32[sup]2[/sup][/link] and [link]32[sup]3[/sup][/link]). These pillars at the entrance of the tabernacle are evangelists, who declare to all that Christ died for their sins. The pillars within the tabernacle are those who experience Christ in a deeper way, who daily attach themselves to the torn veil, to the very Christ who was terminated in His flesh, and bear the testimony that they have been crucified with Christ (cf. [link]Gal. 2:20[/link]). These two kinds of pillars provide entrances for sinners to be saved into God's dwelling place and then to be terminated so that they may come into God's Holy of Holies to enjoy God Himself in His fullness.[br][br]Between the five pillars supporting the screen there were four entrances into the tabernacle, and between the four pillars supporting the veil there were three entrances into the Holy of Holies. The fact that the screen has four entrances indicates that God's dwelling place is open to all people from the four corners of the earth ([link]Rev. 5:9[/link]). The three entrances in the veil indicate that the Triune God Himself is the entrance for His redeemed people to enter not only His dwelling place but also Himself. Cf.

        <note num="2">The acacia wood of which the altar was made signifies the man Jesus ([link]1 Tim. 2:5[/link]), who was judged by God on the cross as our Substitute.

        <note num="3">Five is the number of responsibility, and five by five signifies that Christ bore the full responsibility on the cross to fulfill all the requirements of God's righteousness, holiness, and glory. See note [link]24[sup]1[/sup] in Gen. 3[/link].</note>

        <text>And you shall make a [note]1[/note]grating, a network of bronze for it; and on the net you shall make four bronze [note]2[/note]rings at its four ends.</text>
        <note num="1">The grating, the network of bronze, inside the altar signifies Christ Himself in His redemptive work. It stretched horizontally from side to side at the middle of the height of the altar ([link]v. 5[/link]). The wood was placed on this grating, and the sacrifices were put on the wood. As the wood and the sacrifices burned, the ashes fell through the grating to the bottom of the altar, and the smoke ascended as a sweet savor to God for His satisfaction. The ashes were proof that the sacrifice had been accepted by God and that the offerer had been forgiven. God enjoyed the aroma of the burning sacrifice, and the offerer enjoyed peace.[br][br]The bronze grating, with its rings and poles, is the content of the altar, signifying the inner content of Christ's redemption. That the grating was within the altar signifies that God's judgment upon Christ as our Substitute was not merely outward but reached the inward parts of Christ ([link]Psa. 22:14[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">The bronze rings at the four ends of the grating refer to the eternal Spirit (cf. note [link]12[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 25[/link]), through whom Christ offered Himself on the cross to God to accomplish redemption ([link]Heb. 9:14[/link] and note 2). The eternal Spirit is the power, the strength, the efficacy, of Christ's redemption. The function of the rings was twofold: (1) to bear the weight of the grating, on which the wood and the sacrifices were burned, and (2) to provide a way for the altar to move ([link]38:5[/link], [link]7[/link]). The fire on the altar came from God ([link]Lev. 9:24[/link]; cf. [link]2 Chron. 7:1[/link]) and never ceased ([link]Lev. 6:13[/link]); while the altar was moving, the fire was burning continually. Both the burning and the moving depended on the four rings. This signifies that it is the eternal Spirit who makes Christ's redemption effective and who is the power for the move of the cross of Christ to the four corners of the earth ([link]1 Cor. 1:18[/link]; [link]Rom. 1:16[/link]; [link]15:18-19[/link]; [link]Acts 1:8[/link]; [link]1 Thes. 1:5[/link]). The rings being of the same material as the grating and forming one piece with the grating indicates that the life-giving Spirit is the issue of the redeeming Christ ([link]1 Cor. 15:45[/link]) and of His redemption ([link]Acts 2:38[/link]; [link]Gal. 3:13-14[/link]) and identifies Christ with the Spirit ([link]2 Cor. 3:17[/link]). Christ and His redemption should not be separated from the Spirit ([link]Rev. 5:6[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">The ledge, located inside the altar, might have strengthened the grating and protected the acacia wood in the walls of the altar from the heat of the fire that burned continually on the grating. Thus, the ledge may signify the strengthening power that upheld Christ while He suffered the burning of God's righteous judgment on the cross, and also the protection that enabled Christ in His humanity (signified by the acacia wood) to bear the judgment of God.</note>
        <note num="2">The one and a half cubits above and below the grating was equal to the height of the Ark of the Testimony ([link]25:10[/link]). The fact that the grating of the altar was level with the expiation cover of the Ark signifies that Christ's redemption was accomplished according to the standard of the requirements of God's holiness, righteousness, and glory (cf. [link]Rom. 3:24-25[/link]). Moreover, the fact that there were one and a half cubits above the grating indicates that the effectiveness of Christ's redemption, indicated by God's being satisfied by the fragrant aroma ascending from the sacrifices, also comes up to the standard of God's requirements.</note>

        <note num="1">The outer court of the tabernacle signifies the sphere and boundary of God's dwelling place. The area of the outer court formed a rectangle one hundred cubits in length and fifty cubits in width ([link]vv. 9-13[/link]). This is half of a square with sides of one hundred cubits, signifying that the outer court was a testimony, with one half present and the other half yet to come. The New Jerusalem, as the consummation of God's building, will be a complete whole, a square, not a rectangle ([link]Rev. 21:16[/link]). Cf. note [link]10[sup]3[/sup] in ch. 25[/link].</note>
        <note num="2">When the tabernacle was observed from a distance, its most prominent feature was the fine linen hangings of the outer court. These hangings were both the outward expression and the boundary of God's building. The hangings of the court signify Christ as God's righteousness, who is made righteousness to the church ([link]1 Cor. 1:30[/link]) and is lived out of the church to be its boundary and expression (see notes [link]20[sup]1[/sup] in Matt. 5[/link], [link]9[sup]5[/sup] in Phil. 3[/link], and [link]8[sup]2[/sup] in Rev. 19[/link]).[br][br]With the tabernacle, the expression of God's building was righteousness outwardly, signified by linen, and holiness inwardly, signified by gold. Righteousness is the expression of God in His deeds, and holiness is the expression of God in His nature. The outward expression of the church should be righteousness toward man, and the inward expression should be holiness toward God (cf. [link]Eph. 4:24[/link]). We must have the outward expression of righteousness before we can have the inward expression of holiness (see notes [link]16[sup]2[/sup] in Isa. 5[/link] and [link]19[sup]1[/sup] in Rom. 6[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">For the boundary of God's building, the pillars of bronze signify the Christ who was judged by God, as the standing and supporting strength, and the bronze sockets signify the Christ who was judged by God, as the base (see note [link]37[sup]2[/sup] in ch. 26[/link]). In the outer court the most prominent materials are bronze and linen. That the linen hangings were on bronze pillars that stood in bronze sockets signifies that the righteousness of God is the issue of God's judgment. In Christ there is the element of God's judgment. When we live the judged Christ, everything related to us is under God's judgment. As a result, we become sockets and pillars to bear the righteousness of God, which is God's expression as the boundary and sphere of His dwelling place.</note>
        <note num="2">The hooks and the connecting rods of the pillars were of silver, and the capitals of the pillars were overlaid with silver ([link]38:17[/link]), which was collected from the people for their expiation ([link]30:11-16[/link]; [link]38:25[/link], [link]28[/link]). This signifies Christ's redemption issuing out of God's righteous judgment. The capitals signify glory as a crown, whereas the hooks signify holding power, and the rods, joining strength. Christ's redemption is our glory as well as the holding power and the joining strength to link us, the pillars, to God's righteousness and to join us to one another. The elements of the court of the tabernacle show that if we submit to God's divine judgment (bronze), we will simultaneously experience the redemption of Christ (silver), which links us to God's righteousness (linen) as the expression and testimony of God.</note>

The screen of fine twined linen and blue and purple and scarlet strands (see notes [link book="Exo." chapter="25"]4[sup]1[/sup][/link] and [link]4[sup]2[/sup] in ch. 25[/link]) for the gate signifies the redeeming Christ as the entrance into God's building. That the gate had four pillars with four openings signifies that God's building is open toward men from the four corners of the earth (see [link]vv. 2[/link], [link]4[/link]). The fact that there were three pillars and three sockets on the two sides of the gate, and four pillars and four sockets for the gate, signifies that the appearance of the gate of the court of the tabernacle is that of man (signified by the number four) bearing the Triune God (signified by three) as a testimony (signified by two). The goal of the gospel is to cause repentant sinners to pass through the gate of God's judgment, where everything related to them is judged, and enter into God's building, the church, in which they bear as a testimony the Triune God involved with man.</note>

        <note num="1">The two sets of bronze pegs, for the tabernacle and for the outer court, signify standing and holding power. This power is of bronze, of judgment (see note [link]37[sup]2[/sup] in ch. 26[/link]). The scene in the outer court is filled with bronze, with God's judgment. God's judgment is the strong base and the standing strength in God's building. In the church life the more we place ourselves under God's judgment, the more stable we will be.</note>
        <note num="2">According to the spiritual significances portrayed in the tabernacle and its furnishings, bronze issues in silver, and silver brings forth gold. Through our experience of God's judgment (bronze) we enter into the court of the tabernacle, and through Christ's redemption (silver) as the issue of God's judgment, we enter into the Holy Place and into the Holy of Holies, where everything is gold, i.e., where we enjoy the divine nature and have holiness as the inward expression of God's divine being.</note>

        <note num="1">The tabernacle as the Tent of Meeting, the place where God met with His redeemed people and spoke to them ([link]Lev. 1:1[/link]), typifies the meeting of the church. Thus, in typology the lighting of the lamps points to the proper way to meet. Everything done in the church meetings, whether praying, singing, praising, or prophesying, should cause the lamps to shine.</note>
        <note num="2">[i]Before the Testimony[/i] means before the law in the Ark, which was behind the veil. For the most part, the meeting of God's people is in the Holy Place, not in the Holy of Holies. However, we meet in the Holy Place with the expectation of entering the Holy of Holies. The light from the lamps enables us to see the different aspects of Christ, signified by the items of furniture in the Holy Place, and also the way leading into the Holy of Holies, into the depths of Christ within God.</note>
        <note num="3">The holy task of lighting the lamps was a service of holy persons, the priests, not of the common people. According to the entire Bible a priest is one who is possessed by God, filled with God, saturated with God, and living absolutely for God. Furthermore, a priest had to be clothed with priestly garments ([link]28:2[/link]), which signify Christ lived out of the priesthood. The lighting of the lamps in the Holy Place requires the service of this kind of person.[br][br]The light in the Holy Place was not a natural light or a man-made light. It was a light that came from the golden lampstand, i.e., from the divine nature of Christ. To experience the genuine lighting of the lamps in the church meetings, we must have Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, as the lampstand, the divine nature as the gold, the uplifted humanity of Christ as the wick, and the Spirit of Christ as the oil with all the steps of Christ's process, and we must be holy people as the priests, clothed with the expression of Christ as the priestly garments.</note>
        <note num="4">Nothing is said here about the day. The present age is the night, not the day. Hence, we need the light to shine during this age of night until the day dawns (cf. [link]Rom. 13:12[/link]; [link]2 Pet. 1:19[/link]).</note>

Christ's divinity, typified by the gold of the priestly garments, is for glory, and His humanity, typified by the blue, purple, and scarlet strands and the fine linen, is for beauty. A life that expresses Christ with the divine glory and the human beauty sanctifies us and qualifies us to be the priesthood.</note>

        <note num="1">The gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen were threads of different colors. Gold signifies Christ's divinity. Blue signifies Christ's heavenliness; purple, His royalty, His kingliness; scarlet, His redemption accomplished by the shedding of His blood; and fine twined linen, the fine human living of Christ, manifested through His sufferings. The gold, the blue, the purple, and the scarlet were all woven into the fine twined linen to make the ephod. Therefore, the ephod typifies the composition of Christ's divinity, His kingliness and heavenliness, His redemption, and His fine humanity for the expression of His divine glory and human beauty. The weaving together of the gold and the linen threads in the ephod signifies the mingling of divinity and humanity in Christ, the God-man (the two natures remaining distinct in the mingling). Through Christ's incarnation the gold and the linen, divinity and humanity, were woven together, mingled ([link]John 1:1[/link], [link]14[/link]). This mingling becomes the fastening strength and binding power to hold us to Christ.[br][br]The gold becoming thread indicates a process. First the gold was beaten into thin sheets, then it was cut into threads, and then it was worked into the linen ([link]39:3[/link]). The linen also had to be processed to become twined thread. This portrays that Christ became a man by passing through a process. In His human birth and through the sufferings of His human life on earth, both Christ's divinity and His humanity went through a process and were woven together, mingled. God's redeemed people (the precious stones) are fastened to Christ (Aaron) by His processed divine-human being (the ephod).</note>

        <note num="1">The twelve precious stones on the breastplate, on which the names of the twelve tribes of Israel were engraved, signify all the redeemed and transformed people of God built together to become one entity. Precious stones are not created but are formed by the transforming of created things. This signifies that the church is produced by transformation, from something natural into something divine. As components of the church, the believers, who were created of dust ([link]Gen. 2:7[/link]), must be transformed in their human nature by and with the divine nature through the working of the Spirit ([link]2 Cor. 3:18[/link]) to become precious stones for God's eternal building ([link]Matt. 16:18[/link]; [link]John 1:42[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 2:5[/link]; [link]Rev. 21:18-20[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">The number twelve, composed of four (the creatures) times three (the Triune God in resurrection), signifies the mingling of the Triune God with His creature, man, for the complete and perfect carrying out of God's administration eternally (see notes [link book="Rev." chapter="21"]12[sup]2[/sup][/link] and [link]13[sup]1[/sup] in Rev. 21[/link] and note [link]2[sup]4[/sup] in Rev. 22[/link]). That the stones were arranged in four rows with three stones in each row indicates that the believers are not only transformed but also mingled with the Triune God. The setting of the stones in gold ([link]v. 20[/link]) signifies that the transformed and mingled believers are built in the divine nature of Christ into one entity. These people, being of the number twelve, complete the eternal purpose of God and become the administration of the divine government in the universe.

        <note num="1">After the Urim and the Thummim were put into it, the breastplate became not only a memorial but also a breastplate of judgment. Here and in [link]Deut. 33:8[/link] and [link]10[/link], God's judgments, referring to God's law with its verdicts and judgments (see note [link]6[sup]4[/sup] in Luke 1[/link]), are related to the Urim and the Thummim. According to the Old Testament, the Urim and the Thummim added to the breastplate were a means for God to speak to His people to indicate to them His leading (see references in [link]30a[/link]). God's leading through the breastplate always involved a judgment. God's law includes His judgments, and these judgments become God's leading. In spiritual experience, in order to know God's leading we must judge whatever is of the flesh, the self, the old man, and the world. In [link]Rom. 8:14[/link] the leading of the Spirit, as the reality of God's leading through the breastplate, issues from, and is the totality of, all the judgments in [link]vv. 1-13[/link] of that chapter (see note [link book="Rom." chapter="8"]14[sup]1[/sup][/link] there).[br][br]The fact that God's speaking as His leading was through the breastplate signifies that God makes His leading known to His people through the church. The Lord's speaking through the breastplate with the Urim and the Thummim required the making of the breastplate with the twelve precious stones engraved with the names of the children of Israel and the bearing of the breastplate on the heart of the high priest. In the same principle, God's speaking today through the church with Christ as the Illuminator (Urim) and Perfecter (Thummim) requires the building up of the church with the believers as transformed, transparent precious stones who have been inscribed with Christ as the letters of the spiritual alphabet ([link]2 Cor. 3:3[/link]) and the bearing of the church on the hearts of the leading ones.</note>
        <note num="2">Meaning [i]lights, illuminators.[/i] The Urim was an illuminator inserted into the breastplate under the twelve stones. It had the capacity to contain oil for burning, and the fire used to burn the oil came from the altar. The Urim had twelve illuminators, one to illuminate each of the twelve transparent precious stones on the breastplate so that they could shine with light (David Baron). The Urim typifies Christ as lights, illuminators ([link]John 8:12[/link]; [link]Eph. 5:14[/link]), shining through the Spirit (the oil) and the cross (the fire from the altar).</note>
        <note num="3">Meaning [i]perfecters, completers.[/i] The names on the twelve stones on the breastplate contained only eighteen of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. The remaining four letters were put on the Thummim, making it the perfecter and completer (David Baron). By the shining of the Urim on the individual precious stones, the full alphabet of twenty-two letters could be used to spell out words and sentences. The Thummim typifies Christ as the perfecter and completer ([link]Heb. 12:2[/link]). Christ is the spiritual alphabet for both inscribing (see note [link]21[sup]1[/sup][/link]) and completing. Together, the Urim and the Thummim typify Christ as God's witness, God's testimony ([link]Rev. 3:14[/link]), as the means for God to speak to His people ([link]Heb. 1:2[/link]). In the New Testament, the reality of the Urim and the Thummim is the mingled spirit &amp;#8212; the unveiling Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, indwelling our receiving spirit, our regenerated human spirit ([link]Rom. 8:4[/link], [link]14[/link]).</note>

The sound of the bells was to warn the high priest not to be careless lest he die ([link]v. 35[/link]). That the bells were of gold signifies that the voice of warning in the church has its source in the church's divinity. The pomegranates and the bells signify that the church speaks out of its divinity based on the fullness of life expressed in its humanity. The expression of life and the divine sounding are signs of the proper church life.</note>

To be holy is a matter of having the divine nature wrought into our being to make us holy, as God is (see note [link]19[sup]2[/sup] in Rom. 6[/link]). The engraving Holiness to Jehovah indicates that the entire priesthood is sanctified unto the Lord, separated to the Lord and saturated with the Lord.[br][br]In the concluding word on the priestly garments ([link]vv. 36-43[/link]), gold and linen, the two main materials, signify holiness in divinity and righteousness in humanity. Thus, the garments of the priests are the expression of holiness for glory and righteousness for beauty. A priest who serves God must express the virtues of holiness toward God and righteousness toward man.</note>

        <note num="1">The holy things were the top portion of the produce of the good land that the children of Israel offered to God as holy gifts at the times of their feasts. A portion of these holy gifts was separated for God Himself to enjoy, and the remainder was for the people's enjoyment. The high priest was responsible to ensure that this most holy portion, the portion separated to God, was entirely for Him and was not touched by anyone who was not a priest. If anyone transgressed the ordinance of God's holiness concerning this portion, the high priest was to bear the iniquity of it. For this reason he wore the gold plate that declared HOLINESS TO JEHOVAH. This signifies that as our High Priest, Christ bears the responsibility to make God's people holy in the highest degree and to guard for God the holiness that is in them (cf.

        <note num="1">To be qualified to serve God as priests, Aaron and his sons had to be sanctified, to be set apart by being marked out. The mark that set apart, sanctified, Aaron and his sons to be the priests was the filling of their hands with the offerings ([link]v. 24[/link]; see note [link]41[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 28[/link]), signifying the filling of the believers with the riches of Christ ([link]Eph. 3:8[/link]) through their subjective experience of Him as the reality of the offerings ([link]Heb. 10:5-10[/link]). The steps in sanctifying Aaron and his sons included the washing away of their uncleanness ([link]v. 4[/link]), the covering of their nakedness by the priestly garments ([link]vv. 5-9[/link]), the dealing with their sinful nature through the sin offering ([link]vv. 10-14[/link]), and the feeding of God and the priests with the burnt offering ([link]vv. 15-18[/link]) and the peace offering ([link]vv. 19-28[/link]).

The sin offering is for redemption, the burnt offering is for fellowship with God, and the peace offering is for enjoyment and satisfaction with God. The bull in this chapter typifies the crucified Christ, and the two rams signify the resurrected Christ. As the crucified and resurrected One, Christ not only represents us but also includes us. Hence, when He was crucified, we were crucified with Him ([link]Gal. 2:20a[/link]), and when He was resurrected and presented to God, we were in Him ([link]John 20:17[/link] and note 1; [link]Eph. 2:6a[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">Christ as the trespass offering ([link]Lev. 5:1-6:7[/link]; [link]Heb. 9:28[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 2:24[/link]; [link]3:18[/link]) deals with our sins, our outward sinful deeds, and Christ as the sin offering ([link]Lev. 4:1-35[/link]; [link]Rom. 8:3[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 5:21[/link]; [link]Heb. 9:26[/link]) deals with our sin, our inward sinful nature. Whenever we come to serve God as priests, we must realize and confess that we still have a sinful nature ([link]Rom. 7:17-18a[/link]; [link]1 John 1:8[/link] and note 1) and that we need Christ experientially to be our sin offering to deal with that nature. Through the fall we were constituted of sin ([link]Rom. 5:19[/link]) and even became sin (cf. [link]2 Cor. 5:21[/link]). Enjoying Christ as our sin offering subdues and preserves us, causing us to have no confidence in ourselves ([link]Phil. 3:3[/link]), and also prepares the way for us to enjoy Christ further as the priestly food, typified by the rams and the unleavened bread, cakes, and wafers ([link]vv. 1-2[/link], [link]32-33[/link]). Furthermore, it solves the problem of sin between us and God, reconciling us to God and making peace with God for us ([link]Rom. 5:10[/link], [link]1[/link]), that we may serve Christ to God as food in an atmosphere of peace ([link]vv. 38-42[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">The sprinkling of the blood and the anointing oil on Aaron and his sons and on their garments to sanctify them signifies that God sprinkles us, the New Testament priests, and our conduct (garments) with the redeeming blood of Christ and the compound Spirit (the anointing oil &amp;#8212; [link]30:22-33[/link]) to separate us, to make us holy, unto Him. The blood implies termination and redemption, and the anointing oil implies germination, a new beginning. As terminated, redeemed, and germinated ones, the priests had a new beginning, through which they could serve God (cf. [link]Rom. 7:6[/link]).[br][br]In [link]v. 7[/link] Aaron was anointed apart from the blood. This is a type of the anointing of Christ by God apart from redemption ([link]Psa. 133:2[/link]). A second anointing was needed here, with the anointing oil and the sprinkling of the redeeming blood, because unlike Christ, Aaron and his sons were sinful. The blood being mentioned first here indicates that we must first have the redeeming blood, and then we can participate in the anointing Spirit. Where the blood washes, the Spirit anoints.

The right breast of the ram was first waved before God and then given to Moses as his portion ([link]v. 26[/link]), and both the left breast and the left thigh were heaved up before God and then given to Aaron and his sons, along with the bread, to be their portion ([link]vv. 27-28[/link], [link]31-32[/link]).[br][br]The fat ([link]v. 22[/link]) signifies the tender and excellent parts of Christ as the portion that is for God, and the right thigh signifies Christ as our strength to stand.

The putting of all these portions on the palms of Aaron and of his sons, the waving of them as a wave offering, and the burning of them on the altar upon the burnt offering for an offering of consecration ([link]vv. 24-25[/link]) signifies that the tender, excellent, and strong parts of Christ, with His sinless but Spirit-mingled humanity in different aspects as food, are offered to God in Christ's resurrection (waved &amp;#8212; see note [link]24[sup]1[/sup][/link]) as a satisfying and fragrant offering in the fellowship of His sufferings unto death on the cross for our assuming of the New Testament priesthood.</note>

        <note num="1">The thigh signifies strength and power, and heaving up signifies ascension. Hence, the heave thigh signifies the exalted and ascended Christ in power.

        <note num="1">In the offering of the peace offering, God, Moses, and the priests each had a portion (see note [link]22[sup]1[/sup][/link]).

This is the filling of hands for consecration (see note [link]41[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 28[/link]), and this is true sanctification. At this point Aaron and his sons were fully sanctified, separated, having been washed from their uncleanness, clothed for their nakedness, redeemed from their sinful nature, and filled with the offerings as types of Christ. They had something in their hands to offer to God, and they also had a portion with which to satisfy themselves. Thus they were fully equipped and qualified to serve God as priests.[br][br]The offerings as the priestly food typify Christ. By eating the peace offering the priests, in type, were constituted with Christ, saturated with Christ and transformed with Him. Hence, they were sanctified both positionally and dispositionally; they were separated in position and transformed in disposition.

Flour, made from wheat ([link]v. 2[/link]), typifies Christ as the life supply and the One who produces life ([link]John 6:41[/link]; [link]12:24[/link]). Oil typifies Christ as the anointing Spirit ([link]1 Cor. 15:45[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 3:17[/link]), and wine typifies Christ enjoyed by us and poured out in and with us unto God for His satisfaction (cf.

        <text>[xref]a[/xref]And you shall make an [note]1[/note][xref]b[/xref]altar on which to burn incense; you shall make it of [note]2[/note]acacia wood.</text>
        <note num="1">The incense altar signifies Christ as the Intercessor to maintain the relationship between God and His people ([link]Rom. 8:34[/link]; [link]Heb. 7:25[/link]; [link]Rev. 8:3[/link]). The arrangement of the tabernacle with its furnishings is an accurate and detailed picture of God's administration, God's economy, in the universe. According to this picture the Ark is the focus, but in practice the incense altar is the center. The interceding Christ is the center of the execution of God's government on earth. According to [link]Rev. 8:3-6[/link], the intercessor is not merely the individual Christ but the corporate Christ, the Head with the Body. Christ as the Head is interceding in the heavens, and the church as the Body is interceding on earth ([link]1 Tim. 2:1[/link]).[br][br]In Exodus the incense altar is revealed after the tabernacle and its furniture and the equipping of the priesthood are revealed. This indicates that the priestly service begins at the incense altar, at the place where prayers of intercession are offered to God ([link]Luke 1:10[/link]). The incense altar is the place from which the activities at all the other places in the tabernacle are motivated. It is not merely one item on the passageway through the tabernacle. Rather, it can be compared to a motor that causes everything to operate. Hence, in our experience of the tabernacle (see note [link]4[sup]3[/sup] in Heb. 9[/link]), the incense altar stands by itself as a turning point. It makes all the aspects of the tabernacle and the outer court effective in our experience. The prayer of intercession also motivates others to come to Christ at the altar of burnt offering, at the laver, at the table, at the lampstand, and at the Ark in the Holy of Holies. According to [link]Rev. 8:3[/link], the incense altar is directly in front of the throne of God's authority, which is also the throne of grace (see note [link]2[sup]2[/sup] in Rev. 4[/link]). The prayer offered at the incense altar, a prayer that is offered in Christ and with Christ as the incense (see note [link]7[sup]1[/sup][/link]), governs God's dispensing of grace and motivates the execution of the divine administration. Hence, this prayer governs the universe.</note>
        <note num="2">Acacia wood signifies Christ's humanity, and gold ([link]v. 3[/link]), His divinity. The incense altar made of acacia wood overlaid with gold signifies that Christ's humanity is strong in character and high in standard to express His divinity. Nothing can express God as much as an interceding life based on the renewed and uplifted humanity of Christ.</note>

        <note num="1">The incense altar was a square, one cubit in length and width, and was two cubits high. Thus, it was two cubes of one cubit each. A square signifies perfection, and a cube signifies perfection in perfection. Moreover, two indicates something that gives confirmation and bears a testimony. This implies that the interceding Christ, or the interceding life, is a confirmation, perfection, and testimony. Furthermore, the height of the incense altar was greater than that of the table and the Ark (cf. [link]25:10[/link], [link]23[/link]). This indicates that Christ is interceding in the highest.</note>
        <note num="2">Horns signify strength. The four horns on the incense altar signify the strength of Christ's intercession and indicate that Christ's intercession is powerful toward the four corners of the earth.</note>

        <note num="2">See note [link]11[sup]2[/sup] in ch. 25[/link]. The rim, or crown, of gold around the incense altar signifies the glory of Christ's divinity being the power of Christ's intercession to preserve God's people and His interests.</note>

        <note num="1">The two rings of gold as receptacles for the carrying poles signify the moving of Christ's intercession. The poles of acacia wood overlaid with gold ([link]v. 5[/link]) signify that Christ's human nature with His divine nature is the strength for the moving of His intercession. The rings and the poles both refer to the Spirit of Christ, i.e., to the life-giving Spirit, who includes both Christ's divinity and His humanity. The life-giving Spirit brings the intercession of Christ everywhere on the earth. When the churches and the saints pray with Christ, the life-giving Spirit carries out whatever they pray, bringing the effectiveness of Christ's intercession to every place on earth related to God's interests.</note>

        <note num="1">Regarding the location of the incense altar, see note [link]4[sup]1[/sup] in Heb. 9[/link]. The incense altar was in the center of the tabernacle, which typifies the incarnated God ([link]John 1:14[/link]). To pray at the incense altar, we must enter into the tabernacle, i.e., into Christ as the incarnated God, by offering Christ as the trespass offering and the sin offering on the altar of burnt offering in the outer court (cf. [link]Heb. 10:19-20[/link]) and by eating our portion of the Christ whom we have offered ([link]John 6:57[/link]). Thus, to pray at the incense altar is to pray in Christ and with Christ in us as the energizing life supply. Such prayer is actually Christ praying in us.</note>

        <note num="1">Burning the incense typifies praying ([link]Psa. 141:2[/link]; [link]Luke 1:10-11[/link]; [link]Rev. 8:3-4[/link]). The incense typifies the resurrected and ascended Christ (see note [link]35[sup]1[/sup][/link] in this chapter and note [link]3[sup]4[/sup] in Rev. 8[/link]). Hence, to burn the incense is to pray Christ, to pray in Christ and with Christ as the incense. This kind of prayer is intercessory prayer, not prayer for ourselves but prayer for the carrying out of the divine administration, for the dispensing of God's supplying grace, and for the churches and the saints. Such prayer is a fragrant incense to God &amp;#8212; it fulfills His purpose, satisfies His desire, and delights His heart.</note>

        <note num="1">See [link]Lev. 16[/link] and notes.</note>
        <note num="2">The incense altar was connected to the altar of burnt offering by the redeeming blood of the sin offering ([link]Lev. 4:7[/link]) and by the fire that burned on the altar in the outer court ([link]Lev. 16:12-13[/link]). This indicates that in order to pray at the incense altar, we must first have the experience at the burnt offering altar &amp;#8212; the experience of the blood that solves the problem of our sin and our trespasses, and the experience of the fire that burns us, terminates us, and reduces us to ashes. Then we must go to the table of the bread of the Presence to enjoy Christ as our life and life supply (versus our natural conduct), to the lampstand to be enlightened by Christ as our light (versus our natural sight), and to the Ark to touch Christ as God's testimony (versus our entire natural being as the veil). After passing through all the stations in the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies, we will no longer be natural persons but will be members of the corporate Christ who are qualified to intercede at the incense altar with Christ as the incense (versus our natural virtues).</note>

Only these, not the women or the younger men, were qualified to be ransomed by the expiation silver.[br][br]The tabernacle signifies God embodied in His chosen people for His move on earth to build up the church as His corporate expression. The prayer offered at the incense altar is for God's move. This intercessory prayer issues in the numbering of God's people to form an army to fight against God's enemies, who oppose His move, i.e., against the rulers and authorities in the heavenlies, typified by the inhabitants of the good land (see note [link]23[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 23[/link]). When God has such an army, He is able to move on earth for His interests. Thus, there is a direct relationship between the expiation silver and the incense altar.</note>

        <note num="1">The giving of the half-shekel was used by God for two purposes: (1) to accomplish the formation of an army (see note [link]12[sup]1[/sup][/link]), and (2) to gather silver for the building up of the tabernacle. According to [link]38:25-28[/link], the expiation silver was used to make the one hundred sockets for the boards and pillars of the tabernacle and also to make the capitals, the hooks, and the connecting rods for the pillars. This signifies that the ascended Christ experienced and offered by the strong and mature saints in a local church becomes the base (sockets) in which that church stands and the glory (capitals of the pillars) and the strength and the linking power (hooks and connecting rods) of that church.</note>

        <note num="1">The laver typifies the washing power of the life-giving Spirit issuing from the death of Christ. The locating of the laver after the altar signifies that the washing power of the laver comes out of God's judgment at the altar. After passing through God's full judgment at the altar (the cross), the crucified Christ entered into resurrection and became the life-giving Spirit who washes us ([link]1 Cor. 15:45[/link]; [link]6:11[/link]; [link]Titus 3:5[/link]). The dimensions of the laver are not given, signifying that the life-giving Spirit is immeasurable, unlimited ([link]John 3:34[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">Bronze signifies God's righteous judgment (see note [link]37[sup]2[/sup] in ch. 26[/link]). The bronze used to make the laver came from the mirrors of the serving women who served at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting ([link]38:8[/link]), implying that the laver of bronze was a mirror that could reflect and expose. This indicates that the judgment suffered by Christ on the cross has the power to expose our uncleanness and our need to be washed.</note>
        <note num="3">The laver was put between the altar and the Tent of Meeting to continue the work of the altar for the entrance into the tabernacle. The location of the laver was after the altar, but the function of the laver was before that of the altar ([link]vv. 20-21[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">This holy anointing oil, a compound ointment of olive oil and four spices ([link]vv. 23-24[/link]), is a full type of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit of the processed Triune God, whom Christ became through His death and resurrection ([link]1 Cor. 15:45[/link]; cf. notes [link]39[sup]1[/sup] in John 7[/link] and [link]19[sup]4[/sup] in Phil. 1[/link]). The significances of the ingredients of this compound anointing oil are as follows: (1) flowing myrrh, a spice used in burial ([link]John 19:39[/link]), signifies the precious death of Christ ([link]Rom. 6:3[/link]); (2) fragrant cinnamon signifies the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ's death ([link]Rom. 8:13[/link]); (3) fragrant calamus, from a reed that grew upward in a marsh or muddy place, signifies the precious resurrection of Christ ([link]Eph. 2:6[/link]; [link]Col. 3:1[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 1:3[/link]); (4) cassia, used in ancient times to repel insects and snakes, signifies the power of Christ's resurrection ([link]Phil. 3:10[/link]); and (5) the olive oil as the base of the compound ointment signifies the Spirit of God as the base of the compound Spirit ([link]Gen. 1:2[/link]). Since the number four signifies the creatures ([link]Ezek. 1:5[/link]), of which man is the head ([link]Gen. 1:26[/link]), and the number one signifies the unique God ([link]Deut. 4:35[/link]; [link]1 Tim. 2:5[/link]), the four spices signify the humanity of Christ in God's creation, and the one hin of olive oil signifies the unique God with His divinity. Thus, the blending of olive oil with the four spices signifies the compounding, the mingling, of God and man, of divinity and humanity, in the compound Spirit (cf. [link]Lev. 2:4[/link] and note 3). The olive oil and the four spices were all prepared through a process of either pressing or cutting, signifying that the Spirit of God became the Spirit of Christ ([link]Rom. 8:9[/link] and note 4) through Christ's sufferings ([link]Matt. 26:36[/link] and note). Furthermore, the measure of the four spices, being three complete units of five hundred shekels each, the middle five hundred shekels being split into two parts, signifies the Triune God in resurrection, the second, the Son, being "split" by His death on the cross. Since in the Bible five is the number for responsibility ([link]Matt. 25:2[/link] and note 1), the five elements in the compound ointment and the three units of five hundred shekels of the four spices signify the Triune God in resurrection as the power, the capability, for bearing responsibility. Since the numbers three and five are related to God's building (see note [link]15[sup]2[/sup] in Gen. 6[/link]), these numbers in the compound ointment signify that in the compound Spirit there is the element for God's building. Based on the above significances, the compounding of the four spices with the olive oil to make an anointing oil signifies the mingling of the above-mentioned elements with the Spirit of God through the process of Christ's incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to produce the compound Spirit for the building of God's eternal dwelling place.</note>

[link]1 Pet. 1:2[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 6:11[/link]; [link]Rom. 15:16[/link]). Thus, this ointment signifies the Triune God processed and consummated through Christ's incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection to become the all-inclusive compound Spirit to reach His chosen and redeemed people and to anoint them with Himself, making Himself one with them and making them one with Him ([link]John 20:22[/link]; [link]1 John 2:20[/link], [link]27[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 1:21[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 6:17[/link]). Such an anointing, being the moving of the compound Spirit within us, applies to us and also adds all the elements of the processed and consummated Triune God into our inner being so that our inner man may grow in the divine life with the divine elements and we may be mingled with God as one.[br][br]The holy anointing oil is solely for the purpose of anointing God's dwelling place and the priesthood (cf. [link]1 Pet. 2:5[/link] and note 7). Hence, only those who are for God's dwelling place and for the priesthood can have the enjoyment of the compound, all-inclusive Spirit.</note>

        <text>And Jehovah said to Moses, Take fragrant [note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]spices &amp;#8212; stacte and onycha and galbanum &amp;#8212; fragrant spices with pure [note]1[/note]frankincense; there shall be an [note]2[/note]equal part of each;</text>
        <note num="1">The three fragrant spices signify the Triune God in resurrection (the number three signifies both the Triune God and resurrection), and the addition of pure frankincense, making the number of ingredients four, signifies the humanity of Christ (the number four signifies man as God's creature &amp;#8212; [link]Ezek. 1:5[/link]). The compounding of the four ingredients into one incense signifies the mingling of God with man, of divinity with humanity, in Christ as the incense. Each of the three spices signifies the death of Christ, as follows: (1) stacte, a kind of myrrh, a resinous gum produced by a tree, signifies the sweet death of Christ's generating life (signified by the plant life &amp;#8212; [link]John 12:24[/link]); (2) onycha, the shell of a small animal that grows in the marshes of the Red Sea, signifies the death of Christ with His redemptive life (signified by the animal life &amp;#8212; [link]John 1:29[/link]); and (3) galbanum, also a resinous gum from a tree, signifies the powerful death of Christ's generating life. The disagreeable and offensive odor of galbanum strengthened the fragrance of the other spices and caused the fragrance of the incense to remain and endure. Galbanum was used to repel noxious insects and poisonous reptiles, including serpents. The second of the spices, being of the animal life, signifies that the second of the Godhead was slain to accomplish redemption. Hence, the three spices indicate that Christ's death in His generating life and His redeeming life has three functions: to generate us as sons of God, to redeem us from the fall, and to expel the serpent, the Devil (cf. [link]John 12:24[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 1:18-19[/link]; [link]Heb. 2:14[/link]). The fourth ingredient, frankincense, is a white resinous gum, signifying the sweet resurrection of Christ. The three spices and the frankincense are seasoned with salt ([link]v. 35[/link]), making the number of ingredients five, the number five signifying responsibility ([link]Matt. 24:2[/link]). Cf. note [link]25[sup]1[/sup][/link].</note>
        <note num="2">That all the four ingredients were in equal parts signifies that our experience of Christ should be even, balanced, including equal portions of His death and His resurrection. That no quantities are mentioned signifies that Christ is immeasurable, unlimited (cf. [link]Eph. 3:8[/link], [link]18[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">The holy anointing oil ([link]vv. 23-25[/link]) signifies Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit coming to us from God, whereas the incense signifies Christ as our prayer going to God from us. This is a divine traffic in two directions. The anointing brings God to us in Christ and through Christ for our participation in the divine element; the incense is our going to God with Christ and as Christ in prayer for God's enjoyment. This kind of prayer simultaneously satisfies God with a sweet fragrance and carries out God's economy, God's administration (see note [link]1[sup]1[/sup][/link]).</note>

        <note num="3">Salt kills corruption and functions as a preservative ([link]Matt. 5:13[/link]). In typology salt signifies the killing power and the preserving power of Christ's death. The seasoning of the four ingredients of the incense with salt signifies that our prayer needs to be "salted" by the cross so that all the impure motives in our heart and the bias in our spirit may be killed. For God's coming to us in the compound ointment, the Spirit, the oil, is needed ([link]v. 24[/link]); for our going to God in prayer, the cross, the salt, is needed.</note>

        <note num="1">According to [link]vv. 35-36[/link] the incense must be salted, beaten, and burned. Beating the incense and putting it before the testimony in the Tent of Meeting signify the blending of Christ's sweet death and His fragrant resurrection and the offering of His death and resurrection to God on the incense altar as a base for the intercession of Christ and His members. In order to have Christ as the incense to offer to God as a sweet-smelling fragrance, we need the genuine experiences of Christ with all the ingredients of the incense, and these experiences must be salted, beaten, and burned.</note>
        <note num="2">I.e., on the incense altar. The testimony is the law inside the Ark (see note [link]34[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 16[/link]). Thus, this verse indicates that the incense altar was directly in front of the Ark. The significance of the closeness of the incense altar and the Ark is that the kind of prayer that is Christ Himself ascending to God as incense is the outcome of our contact with God and our being in His presence.</note>

It is also an eternal covenant ([link]v. 16[/link]) assuring God that we will be one with Him by first enjoying Him and then working with Him, for Him, and in oneness with Him. God first worked and then rested; man first rests and then works ([link]Gen. 2:2[/link] and note).

However, before giving Moses the tablets, God first gave him the design of the tabernacle and instructions concerning the priesthood ([link]25:1-31:17[/link]).

However, before the gold could be used for God's purpose, it was usurped by Satan and used by God's people to make an idol.

        <note num="1">The golden calf was not a pagan idol, for it was made by Aaron, a genuine high priest appointed by God. Furthermore, Aaron made the calf in the name of Jehovah and took the lead to worship the idol in the way of presenting offerings to God and worshipping God ([link]vv. 4-6[/link], [link]8[/link]). Thus, God's redeemed people worshipped an idol in the name of Jehovah their God and in the way ordained by God (cf. [link]Psa. 106:19-20[/link]; [link]Rom. 1:23[/link]). This was a pretense and a subtle mixture in the worship of God.[br][br]According to the principles in the New Testament, idolatry is the main source of division and fornication. The golden calf idol caused a division among the children of Israel (cf. [link]1 Cor. 1:10-13[/link]; [link]11:18-19[/link]). Actually, division is spiritual fornication (cf. [link]Rev. 17:1-5[/link]). Idolatry and fornication always go together ([link]Num. 25:1-2[/link]; [link]Rev. 2:20[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">A calf is not for labor but for eating and therefore signifies enjoyment ([link]Gen. 18:7-8[/link]; [link]Luke 15:23[/link]). After the golden calf was made, the people ate, drank, and rose up to play in front of it ([link]vv. 6[/link], [link]18-19a[/link]). This picture indicates that the children of Israel worshipped what they enjoyed. Their worshipping of the gold calf was an amusement and an entertainment, indicating that amusement and entertainment were their idol.</note>

God intended that the entire nation of Israel would be a kingdom of priests ([link]19:6[/link]), but because of the worship of the golden calf, the majority of the children of Israel lost the priesthood. The priesthood was given to a single tribe, the tribe of Levi.[br][br]God's intention is that every believer in Christ, every child of God, would be a priest ([link]Rev. 1:6[/link]; [link]5:10[/link]). However, through the centuries impure worship has caused the majority of the believers to lose their priesthood. The relatives of the Levites signify ourselves, that part of our being which participates in the worship of idols.

An idol is any person, matter, or thing that replaces God and keeps us from the full enjoyment of Christ as our good land. God declared that He would do everything to bring the people into the good land ([link]vv. 10-11[/link]), but He also pointed out the danger of idolatry, which would nullify His wondrous doings on behalf of the children of Israel. Likewise, God has promised to do everything necessary to bring us into the all-inclusive Christ for our enjoyment (cf. [link]Col. 1:12-13[/link]), but we must take heed to God's warning concerning idolatry (cf. [link]1 John 5:21[/link]).</note>

The focus of this repeated speaking is not on the keeping of the Ten Commandments and the ordinances of the law but on the enjoyment of God through the enjoyment of the riches of the good land and the repeated feasting and resting with Him. This matches the focus of the New Testament teaching, which is concerned primarily with the enjoyment of Christ ([link]1 Cor. 1:9[/link]; [link]5:8[/link]). It was not God's intention merely to have a people to keep His commandments and ordinances. God's intention was to dispense Himself into His chosen people so that they would be fully infused with Him in order to express Him (see note [link]29[sup]1[/sup][/link]).</note>

According to this chapter, God did not first give Moses the tablets of the law; rather, He first spent time to infuse Moses with Himself by speaking to Moses concerning the enjoyment of Himself (cf. [link]2 Cor. 3:3[/link]). Before God gave the law to Moses, God gave Himself to him. This clearly portrays God's intention.</note>

        <note num="1">The tabernacle was erected on the first day of the first month of the second year ([link]v. 17[/link]). The first month of the first year was the time of the passover ([link]13:4[/link]). Hence, the time from the passover to the erecting of the tabernacle was one year.[br][br]God's people had two beginnings, the first at the passover, which was for their salvation, and the second at the erecting of the tabernacle, which was related to the building of God's dwelling place. Every genuine Christian should have these two beginnings: the experience of salvation and the practical experience of the building of the church as God's dwelling place ([link]1 Tim. 3:15[/link]).</note>

Most Christians focus on the experience of salvation at the altar, but the book of Exodus reveals that God's intention is to have the Ark of the Testimony in the Tabernacle of the Testimony. Eventually, the Ark in the tabernacle will consummate in an eternal tabernacle, the New Jerusalem, with the Ark, the redeeming Christ, as the center ([link]Rev. 21:2-3[/link]; [link]22:1[/link]). God's eternal goal is to have the New Jerusalem as the ultimate fulfillment of the tabernacle with the Ark.</note>

        <note num="1">With respect to man, the tabernacle was the Tent of Meeting, but with respect to God, it was the tabernacle.

        <note num="2">Glory is God's expression, God Himself expressed. The cloud covering the Tent of Meeting was the outer part, the outer covering, of God's glory. Those who were gathered around the Tent of Meeting could see the cloud, whereas the high priest who eventually entered into the Holy of Holies ([link]Lev. 16:15[/link]; [link]Heb. 9:7[/link]) in the tabernacle could see the inward glory of the tabernacle. This indicates that in our experience of the church life we need to advance by entering into the tabernacle &amp;#8212; Christ as the embodiment of God &amp;#8212; to enjoy the bread at the table and to intercede at the incense altar, that we may experience the glory in God's dwelling place (cf. note [link]14[sup]2[/sup], par. 3, in John 1[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">I.e., the cloud.</note>
        <note num="2">In the Old Testament times the house of God was the house of Israel, represented here by the tabernacle and later by the temple (see note [link]6[sup]1[/sup] in Heb. 3[/link]). At the end of Genesis an individual Israel was produced as a miniature of God's house to express God and exercise His authority. At the end of Exodus a corporate Israel was produced as God's house to express God and represent Him by exercising His authority on earth. The goal of God's eternal purpose is to have a corporate people to be His dwelling place for His expression and representation in eternity. The books of Genesis and Exodus together consummate with God's tabernacle, His dwelling place, filled with His glory ([link]v. 34[/link]). Likewise, the entire Bible consummates in the New Jerusalem as the eternal tabernacle of God filled with the glory of God ([link]Rev. 21:2-3[/link], [link]10-11[/link]) and exercising God's authority for His divine administration in eternity ([link]Rev. 22:1[/link], [link]5[/link]).</note>
