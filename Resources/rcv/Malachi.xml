        <text>I am about to [xref]a[/xref]send [note]1[/note]My messenger, and he will [xref]b[/xref]clear the way before Me; and suddenly the Lord, whom you seek, will come to His temple. And the [note]2[/note][xref]c[/xref]Angel of the covenant, whom you [note]3[/note][xref]d[/xref]desire, He will come, says Jehovah of hosts.</text>
        <note num="1">Heb. [i]malachi[/i]. First, this prophecy concerning the coming of Jehovah's messenger was fulfilled in the coming of the prophet Malachi, a type of Christ as the coming One. Second, this prophecy was fulfilled in the first coming of Christ with John the Baptist as His forerunner ([link]Isa. 40:3-5[/link]; [link]Matt. 11:7-13[/link]). In His first coming Christ came as a Messenger and even as the message sent by God. As the Messenger of God, Christ not only brings a word or a message from God to God's people; He Himself is the living message. This is proven by the four Gospels, which are a complete and perfect record of Christ as the living message sent by God to His chosen people (see note [link]2[sup]2[/sup] in Heb. 1[/link]). As God's Messenger Christ came to adjust, refine, and purify the priests. In the Gospels the Lord Jesus frequently rebuked the priests. Third, this prophecy will be fulfilled in the second coming of Christ with Elijah as His forerunner ([link]4:5[/link] and note).</note>
        <note num="2">Or, Messenger. Christ's coming suddenly as the Angel of the covenant will be to execute upon Israel the covenant that He enacted through His death ([link]Matt. 26:28[/link]). In His first coming Christ came in the way of an Angel, a serving one (cf. [link]Heb. 1:14[/link]), to serve God in forming the new testament ([link]Mark 10:45[/link]). When He established His table on the night in which He was betrayed, He enacted the new covenant ([link]Luke 22:20[/link]), in which God is obligated to forgive our sins and to dispense Himself into our being to be our life, our law of life, and our everything as our inward content that we may live Him ([link]Jer. 31:31-34[/link]; [link]Heb. 8:8-12[/link]). As the Angel of the covenant, Christ in resurrection executes the new covenant as its surety ([link]Heb. 7:22[/link]), making it real to us by assuring us that our sins have been forgiven and by dispensing the riches of the covenanted Triune God into us. See notes [link book="Jer." chapter="31"]31[sup]1[/sup][/link], [link]33[sup]1[/sup][/link], and [link]33[sup]2[/sup] in Jer. 31[/link].[br/][br/]Although the Lord Jesus enacted the new covenant nearly two thousand years ago, generally the Jewish people have not benefited from it. Instead, the benefit has gone to the Gentiles. However, when Christ comes back, He will come as the Angel of the covenant to execute His covenant over the repentant and believing Jews. At that time they will become beneficiaries of the new covenant.</note>

        <note num="1">Christ will come also to refine and purify the sons of Levi, mainly the priests, like a refiner's fire and like fuller's soap that they may offer to God the proper sacrifice ([link]vv. 2-4[/link]). In the millennium the repentant Jews who are regenerated through the new covenant will be the priests to care for all the nations ([link]Isa. 2:2-3[/link]; [link]Zech. 8:20-23[/link]). For this they will need much refining and purifying. Therefore, in His second coming Christ will renew, sanctify, and transform Israel to be His refined and purified priests.</note>

        <text>But unto you who fear My name will the [note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]Sun of righteousness arise with [note]2[/note][xref]b[/xref]healing in His wings, and you will go forth and leap about like well-fed calves.</text>
        <note num="1">The healing Christ, who Himself is the healing of God's people and of the nations. Christ is the Sun that heals us as it shines upon us. Christ's being our healing is based on His being the Sun of righteousness. The word Sun indicates life (cf. [link]John 1:4[/link]), and the word righteousness indicates justice. The whole earth is filled with death and injustice, but with the healing Christ there is life and justice. Today we, the believers in Christ, enjoy Christ's shining as the Sun of righteousness for our growth in life in the dispelling of darkness, and also for our healing in life in the effacing of unrighteousness. Our hope, our expectation, is that Christ is coming as the Sun of righteousness with healing in His wings to heal the nations from darkness and unrighteousness. We are waiting for Him as the Desire of the nations ([link]3:1b[/link]; [link]Hag. 2:7b[/link]) and as the Sun of righteousness.[br/][br/]In relation to Israel, Christ came the first time to heal the degraded priesthood ([link]3:1-4[/link]), but in His second coming, He will heal the remnant of the people of Israel. Then He will be everything to the nations and to His people. This healing Christ will come suddenly. Thus, we need to be alert, ready to receive Him.</note>
