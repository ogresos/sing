        <verse num="1">
        <text>The [xref]a[/xref]vision of [note]1[/note]Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of [xref]b[/xref]Uzziah, [xref]c[/xref]Jotham, [xref]d[/xref]Ahaz, [i]and[/i] [xref]e[/xref]Hezekiah, the kings of Judah:</text>
        <note num="1">Meaning [i]the salvation of Jah.[/i] The book of Isaiah, in its content concerning God's eternal economy in Christ, is the leading book among all the books of the prophets. This book is the vision that Isaiah saw ([link]v. 1[/link]), the word that Isaiah saw ([link]2:1[/link]), and the burden that Isaiah saw ([link]13:1[/link]; [link]15:1[/link]). The vision, word, and burden in Isaiah are concerned with God's eternal economy in Christ, which is thoroughly covered in this book.[br][br]The book of Isaiah unveils that God's dealing in love with His beloved Israel and His righteous judgment upon the nations bring in Christ, the Savior ([link]43:3[/link]; [link]49:26[/link]), who is God ([link]9:6[/link]) incarnated to be a man ([link]7:14[/link]), possessing both the divine nature and the human nature ([link]4:2[/link]), living on this earth ([link]53:2-3[/link]; [link]42:1-4[/link]), crucified ([link]53:7-10a[/link], [link]12[/link]), resurrected ([link]53:10b-11[/link]), ascended ([link]52:13[/link]), and coming ([link]40:10[/link]; [link]64:1[/link]) to meet the need of God's chosen people and the nations ([link]9:1-7[/link]; [link]49:6[/link]) in God's all-inclusive salvation ([link]12:2-3[/link]), that the restoration of all things, of the created yet fallen universe ([link]2:2-5[/link]; [link]11:6-9[/link]; [link]35:1-10[/link]; [link]30:26[/link]), may be brought in, which will consummate in the new heaven and new earth for eternity ([link]65:17[/link]). Hence, the content of Isaiah covers God's entire economy of the New Testament, from the incarnation ([link]Matt. 1:18-25[/link]) to the new heaven and new earth ([link]Rev. 21-22[/link]), with the Old Testament background of God's dealing with Israel and His judgment upon the nations. According to Isaiah's prophecy, the Christ who was processed for the divine purposes is the centrality and universality of the great wheel of the move of the Divine Trinity ([link]Ezek. 1:15[/link] and note 1) for the accomplishing of His economy in the divine dispensing of Himself into His elect.</note>

        <note num="1">In the book of Isaiah, God's love toward Israel is exercised in a threefold way: as a Father ([link]1:2-3[/link]; [link]63:16[/link]; [link]64:8[/link]), as a nursing Mother ([link]66:13[/link]), and as a Husband ([link]54:5[/link]). Since God deals with His beloved Israel in a loving way, His dealing with them, in general, is a matter not of judgment but of chastisement. God's dealing with the Gentiles, the nations, however, is a matter of judgment based on God's righteousness, on His justice.[br][br]God deals with people according to what He is. God is holy and righteous; He is the Holy One and the righteous One ([link]v. 4[/link]; [link]24:16a[/link]). As the Holy One, He chastises His people that they may be holy ([link]Heb. 12:10[/link]), and as the righteous One, He judges the nations because they are not just and righteous.

        <note num="1">In God's full salvation He not only forgives our sins, exempting us from the penalty of our sins and removing the record of our sins from before Him; He also washes away the traces of sins in us, making us as white as snow and white like wool. Both snow and wool are naturally white. Hence, as a result of God's washing, we become not only white but also naturally white, as if we had never been defiled. The washing that makes us as white as snow is a positional washing from without through the blood of Jesus Christ ([link]1 John 1:7[/link]; [link]Heb. 1:3b[/link]; [link]Rev. 1:5[/link]), whereas the washing that makes us white like wool is a washing of our nature metabolically from within by God's Spirit and by His life ([link]1 Cor. 6:11[/link] and note; [link]Titus 3:5[/link] and note 4).

        <note num="2">In this book Christ is unveiled as the God-man. [i]The Shoot of Jehovah[/i] refers to Christ's deity, showing His divine nature, and [i]the fruit of the earth[/i] ([link]Luke 1:42[/link]) refers to Christ's humanity with His human nature. As the Shoot of Jehovah, Christ comes out of God, out of eternity ([link]John 8:42[/link]; [link]Micah 5:2[/link]). As the fruit of the earth, Christ, having a human body made of dust ([link]Gen. 2:7[/link]), grows out of the earth (cf. [link]53:2[/link]). In the restoration, to those of Israel who have escaped, Christ in His deity will be beauty and glory, and in His humanity, which expresses His divine beauty and glory, He will be excellence and splendor. [i]The Shoot of Jehovah[/i] denotes that through His incarnation Christ is a new development of Jehovah God for the Triune God to branch Himself out in His divinity into humanity ([link]7:14[/link]; [link]Matt. 1:22-23[/link]). This is for Jehovah God's increase and spread in the universe. [i]The fruit of the earth[/i] denotes that Christ, as the divine Shoot of Jehovah, also becomes a man of flesh from the earth ([link]John 1:14[/link]; [link]Heb. 2:14[/link]). This is for the Triune God to be multiplied and reproduced in humanity. As a man with the divine life, He is a seed, a grain of wheat, to produce many grains, His believers as His many brothers, through His death and resurrection ([link]John 12:24[/link]; [link]20:17[/link]; [link]Rom. 8:29[/link]).[br][br][i]The Shoot of Jehovah[/i] denotes the riches, the refreshing, the vigor, the growth, and the productive power of the divine life. [i]The fruit of the earth[/i] denotes the produce brought forth, carried out, and expressed in Christ's humanity. As seen in the four Gospels, all the fruit born by Christ came out of the divine life, but it was produced in Christ's humanity. In Christ, the God-man, God and man live together as one, with God as the life inwardly and man as the fruit outwardly.</note>

        <text>Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: [xref]a[/xref]Behold, the [xref]b[/xref]virgin will conceive and will [xref]c[/xref]bear a son, and she will call his name [note]1[/note][xref]d[/xref]Immanuel.</text>
        <note num="1">Meaning [i]God with us.[/i] The actual fulfillment of this sign was the birth of a son by Isaiah's wife ([link]8:3[/link]). The ultimate fulfillment was the incarnation, in which Jesus Christ was born of the virgin Mary as a child of a dual nature, the divine nature and the human nature, issuing in Immanuel, i.e., God with us, for the salvation of God's people, including those of Israel and those of the church ([link]Matt. 1:20-23[/link] and notes). Christ, the God-man, the mingling of God and man, who is the Shoot of Jehovah and the fruit of the earth ([link]4:2[/link]), is Immanuel, God with us ([link]Matt. 18:20[/link]; [link]28:20[/link]). Immanuel is all-inclusive; He is first our Savior ([link]Luke 2:11[/link]), then our Redeemer ([link]John 1:29[/link]), then our Life-giver ([link]1 Cor. 15:45b[/link]), and then the all-inclusive indwelling Spirit ([link]John 14:16-20[/link]; [link]Rom. 8:9-11[/link]). Actually, the content of the entire New Testament is an Immanuel ([link]Matt. 1:23[/link]; [link]18:20[/link]; [link]28:20[/link]; [link]Rev. 21:3[/link]), and all the believers in Christ, as the members of Christ, are a part of this great Immanuel, the corporate Christ ([link]1 Cor. 12:12[/link]; [link]Col. 3:10-11[/link]). The sign of Immanuel consummates in the New Jerusalem, which will be the aggregate of Immanuel, the totality of God being with us.</note>

        <note num="1">Indicating that the land of Judah, the Holy Land, is the territory of Christ, who is Immanuel, God with us. This land, which was invaded by the army of Assyria, is the land that Christ will inherit to build up His millennial kingdom with His two elect peoples, the chosen Jews as His earthly people and the chosen believers as His heavenly people. God's eternal economy is to gain for Himself these two peoples as a treasure.[br][br]Satan, God's enemy, uses the nations to frustrate the accomplishing of God's economy. The invaders and occupiers of the Holy Land, the land of Immanuel, are signified by the human image in [link]Dan. 2[/link], the head of which is Babylon. The enemies of God's people in the Old Testament began from Babylon ([link]2 Kings 24-25[/link]), which issued from Babel ([link]Gen. 11:1-9[/link]). In the New Testament the enemy of God's chosen people, the church, still is called Babylon &amp;#8212; Babylon the Great ([link]Rev. 17-18[/link]). Eventually, both the religious Babylon (the apostate Roman Church) and the material Babylon (the city of Rome) will be destroyed, after which the kingdom will come. Even the termination of Babylon is included in the sign of a virgin bearing a son called Immanuel. The sign of Immanuel is still being fulfilled today. It is an all-inclusive sign that covers the Bible from [link]Gen. 11[/link] through [link]Rev. 22[/link]. See note [link]14[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 7[/link].</note>

Through the birth of the divine-human child, the Eternal Father gave us His divine Son as a gift. Through such a giving, everyone who believes in, i.e., receives, this dear Son receives eternal life ([link]John 3:16[/link]; [link]1 John 5:11-12[/link]).

        <note num="1">[link]Isaiah 9:8-10:34[/link] shows that both the oppressed, the kingdom of Israel, and the oppressor, the kingdom of Assyria, were under the judgment of God. These two judgments were actually one ([link]10:22-23[/link]). After the time of Solomon, the nation of Israel was divided into the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah ([link]1 Kings 11:26-12:20[/link]). Because the kingdom of Israel had fallen to the extent that it was on the level of the Gentile nations, even becoming an ally to the king of Aram ([link]7:1[/link]), Israel was not only under God's chastisement but also under His judgment. God's chastisement on Israel (Ephraim &amp;#8212; [link]v. 9[/link]) became His judgment on Israel.</note>

        <note num="1">In the restoration the coming Christ will be a sprout that comes forth from the stump of Jesse and a branch from his roots. Israel, especially the house of David, was like a tall tree. However, because of Israel's degradation, that tree was cut down, leaving only a stump with its roots. Both Mary and Joseph were descendants of David, part of the royal family (see note [link]16[sup]2[/sup] in Matt. 1[/link]), but they had become poor and were people of a low class, living in Nazareth, a despised city, in Galilee, a despised region ([link]Luke 1:26-27[/link]). Christ as a sprout came forth from the stump of Jesse, above the earth, signifying that restoration is by life and of life. Furthermore, Christ as a branch came forth from Jesse's roots, underneath the earth, signifying the depths of the restoring life, to branch out God and bear much fruit. Christ as a sprout and a branch is full of restoring power, deepening power, growing power, and fruit-bearing power. Because of His branching out, the whole world is filled with His fruit.

        <note num="1">The branching out of Jehovah is altogether a matter of the Spirit.

Moreover, He was baptized, anointed, with the Spirit ([link]Matt. 3:16[/link]; [link]Luke 4:18[/link]). The Spirit was with Him all the time and was one with Him ([link]Luke 4:1[/link], [link]14[/link]; [link]10:21[/link]; [link]John 1:32[/link]; [link]Matt. 12:28[/link]). He walked by the Spirit and lived a life in, with, by, and through the Spirit. In His human living the Spirit was manifested with all the attributes mentioned in this verse.

        <note num="1">When Adam fell, sin entered into him ([link]Rom. 5:12[/link]). Since he, the head of all the creatures, became fallen, something of Satan also entered into the creatures. In the restoration Christ's restoring power will deliver all the creatures from the poisonous element of Satan, causing a change not only in outward action but also in inward nature ([link]Rom. 8:19-21[/link]). As a result, the situation among them will be pleasant, peaceful, and loving. The reason for this change is that the knowledge of God, i.e., the knowing of God, will fill the earth ([link]v. 9[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">Christ's being the root, the sprout, and the branch of Jesse ([link]v. 1[/link]) indicates that He is connected to humanity, whereas Christ's resting place being the glory indicates that He is very much related to God (see note [link]10[sup]4[/sup][/link]).

        <note num="2">Through the restoration of Israel, Christ will become a banner to the peoples and a standard to the nations ([link]v. 12[/link]). The banner is mainly for designation, explanation, and instruction, and the standard is mainly for calling and gathering people ([link]5:26[/link]). In this chapter Isaiah couples Christ as the sprout and the branch ([link]v. 1[/link]) with Christ as the banner and the standard. When Christ as a sprout grows among God's people, this growing-up sprout becomes a banner, which describes, explains, designates, and even gives instructions to the peoples of the earth concerning what Christ is to God's people. This same Christ as a branch grows up to be a standard to call and gather the nations of the earth.</note>

        <text>Therefore you will draw [note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]water with rejoicing / From the [note]2[/note]springs of salvation,</text>
        <note num="1">The way to receive God as our salvation is to draw water from the springs of salvation, i.e., to drink Him ([link]Psa. 36:8[/link]; [link]John 4:14[/link]; [link]7:37[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 12:13[/link]; [link]Rev. 22:17[/link]). To be our salvation, the Triune God was processed to become the life-giving Spirit as the living water, the water of life ([link]1 Cor. 15:45[/link]; [link]John 7:37-39[/link]; [link]Rev. 21:6[/link]; [link]22:1[/link], [link]17[/link]). When the living water enters into us, it permeates our entire being, causing us to be nourished, transformed, conformed, and glorified ([link]Rom. 12:2[/link]; [link]8:29-30[/link]). Both the Old Testament and the New Testament show that God's practical salvation is the processed Triune God Himself as the living water.</note>
        <note num="2">The fountain is the source, the spring is the gushing up, the issue, of the source, and the river is the flow. The term [i]the springs of salvation[/i] implies that salvation is the source, i.e., the fountain. God as our salvation is the fountain ([link]v. 2[/link]); Christ is the springs of salvation for our enjoyment and experience ([link]John 4:14[/link]); and the Spirit is the flow of this salvation within us ([link]John 7:38-39[/link]).[br][br]Christ as the life-giving Spirit ([link]1 Cor. 15:45[/link]) is the many springs of salvation gushing up from the fountain of the Triune God's salvation, from whom the believers may draw the water of life for their enjoyment ([link]v. 3a[/link]; [link]John 4:14[/link]; [link]Rev. 21:6[/link]). As God incarnated, Christ is the very embodiment of the Triune God ([link]John 1:14a[/link]; [link]Col. 2:9[/link]). Jesus, Jehovah our Savior and our salvation ([link]Matt. 1:21[/link]), has become the source of our eternal salvation through the process of His vicarious death for the accomplishing of God's eternal redemption ([link]Heb. 5:9[/link]; [link]9:12[/link]). Based on His redemption, He as our Redeemer becomes our Savior and our salvation.</note>

        <note num="1">The Latin Vulgate translates, Lucifer. This refers to Satan, who, as the Daystar, son of the dawn, was one of the earliest angels (the sons of God &amp;#8212; [link]Job 38:7[/link], cf. [link]Job 1:6[/link]) created by God at the "dawn" of the universe. He was appointed by God to be the head of all the angels ([link]Ezek. 28:14[/link]; [link]Jude 9[/link]) and later became Satan, the adversary of God, after he rebelled against God (see note [link]13[sup]1[/sup][/link]). Because of his rebellion, Lucifer as Satan was judged by God ([link]vv. 12-15[/link]; [link]Ezek. 28:16-19[/link]; [link]Luke 10:18[/link]).[br][br]In [link]vv. 12-15[/link] Isaiah identifies Lucifer with Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon ([link]v. 4[/link]), thus regarding Nebuchadnezzar as a figure of Satan, as one who was one with Satan (cf. [link]Ezek. 28:12[/link]). This unveils Satan's kingdom of darkness behind the nations ([link]Eph. 6:12b[/link]; cf. [link]Dan. 10:13[/link], [link]20[/link]) and his oneness with the rulers of the nations.</note>

        <note num="1">Satan's rebellion against God is revealed in [link]vv. 13-14[/link] and in [link]Ezek. 28:15-18[/link]. Satan's heart was lifted up because of his beauty, and he corrupted his wisdom by reason of his brightness ([link]Ezek. 28:17[/link]). In his arrogance Satan declared five times, "I will...," indicating that his intention in his rebellion was to overthrow God's authority and to exalt himself to be equal with God. Satan's ambition for position became the motivation of all the rebellions recorded in the Scriptures ([link]Gen. 11:4[/link]; [link]Num. 12:1-2[/link]; [link]16:1-3[/link]; [link]2 Sam. 15:10-12[/link]; etc.). Because of his rebellion Satan became God's adversary, God's enemy ([link]Zech. 3:1-2[/link]; [link]Rev. 12:9a[/link]; [link]20:2a[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">This is Hades in the New Testament (see note [link]23[sup]1[/sup] in Matt. 11[/link]). Satan wanted to exalt himself to the uttermost parts of the north ([link]v. 13[/link]), but God judged the rebellious Satan, sentencing him to be cast from the heavens to the earth and into Sheol, to the uttermost parts of the pit ([link]vv. 12[/link], [link]15[/link]; [link]Ezek. 28:17[/link]). See [link]Luke 10:18[/link] and note; [link]Rev. 12:9[/link] and note 1. Because Satan's rebellion polluted not only the earth but also the heavens (see notes [link]20[sup]5[/sup] in Col. 1[/link] and [link]23[sup]1[/sup] in Heb. 9[/link]), both the earth and the heavens were judged by God. As a result, the sun and the stars did not shine, and the earth was covered with darkness and buried under deep water ([link]Gen. 1:2[/link]; [link]Job 9:5-7[/link]).[br][br]According to [link]Rev. 12:4a[/link] and [link]9b[/link], one-third of the angels of heaven joined Satan in his rebellion. They too must have been judged by God (cf. [link]Matt. 25:41[/link]), and after being judged they became the fallen angels, Satan's subordinates as the rulers, the authorities, the world-rulers of this darkness, the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies ([link]Eph. 6:12[/link] and note 2; see note [link]11[sup]1[/sup] in Dan. 10[/link]). The living creatures on the earth in the preadamic age also joined Satan in his rebellion. After being judged by God through water ([link]Gen. 1:2[/link]), they became disembodied spirits, the demons ([link]Matt. 8:28-32[/link]; [link]12:43-45[/link]), who lodge in the water with which they were judged (see notes [link]32[sup]2[/sup] in Matt. 8[/link] and [link]1[sup]3[/sup] in Rev. 21[/link]) and work on earth for Satan's kingdom of darkness ([link]Matt. 12:26[/link]; [link]Acts 26:18a[/link]; [link]Col. 1:13a[/link]).</note>

While Christ as God's Steward serves in God's house, He also governs, rules, and administrates God's children, who are under Christ's care.</note>

The church is both God's house ([link]1 Tim. 3:15[/link]) and God's kingdom ([link]Matt. 16:18-19[/link]; [link]Rom. 14:17[/link]). The key set on Christ's shoulder is the key for the keeping of all the treasures of the house of God, which are all the riches of Christ for our enjoyment. Christ is the One who can open and shut the door to the treasury of God's riches, which are embodied in Him ([link]Col. 2:9[/link]).</note>

        <text>And I will drive him as a [note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]peg into a sure place, / And he will become a [note]2[/note]throne of glory for his father's house.</text>
        <note num="1">Christ has been driven by God as a peg, or nail, into a sure place ([link]v. 23a[/link]), which typifies the third heaven (cf. [link]2 Cor. 12:2b[/link]), where Christ was exalted by God after His resurrection ([link]Acts 2:33[/link]; [link]5:31[/link]). Because the Father is in the third heaven ([link]Matt. 6:9[/link]), to be exalted to the third heaven is to be exalted to God the Father (cf. [link]Luke 15:18[/link]). Christ today is in the heavens as a peg driven into God. See notes on [link]v. 24[/link].</note>
        <note num="2">Christ will become a throne of glory for His Father's house. The glory here is the children of God, who are vessels hanging upon Christ as the peg ([link]v. 24[/link] and notes). With the glory there is a throne, and this throne is actually Christ Himself. The throne signifies the administrative authority and the kingdom. Christ in His administrative authority is the throne that governs everything within the house of God.</note>

        <note num="1">Or, weight. In this verse [i]glory[/i] is in apposition with both [i]the offspring and the issue[/i] and [i]vessels.[/i] Thus, the glory of the Father's house that hangs on Christ as the peg is the children of God as the offspring and the issue (descendants) of God, and these children of God are the vessels of Christ, who hang on Him in order to contain Him and to minister Him to others. The children of God as the offspring and the issue are glory in the house of God, and they are also the vessels.</note>
        <note num="2">The bowls and jars typify the different ways and means for us to partake of Christ in His riches. Bowls, or cups, are small vessels to contain water, typifying the Spirit of Christ ([link]John 7:37-39[/link]), and jars, or pitchers, are large vessels to contain wine, typifying the divine life ([link]Matt. 9:17[/link] and note 1). This signifies that in the house of God all His children are vessels to contain His Spirit as water to quench people's thirst and His life as wine to cheer people unto rejoicing. All the riches of the bountiful supply for the enjoyment of God's children are hanging on Christ as the peg, the holder.</note>

        <note num="1">Referring not to Eliakim (Christ) but to Shebna ([link]v. 15[/link]), who was replaced by Eliakim. In His judgment God discharged, or "fired," everyone and everything, including the kings of the nations, Shebna the steward, and all the bowls and jars in God's house, and replaced them all with Christ. God discharged everyone on the cross, and He is replacing everyone with Christ. Because Christ joined Himself to us, uniting Himself with us, when He died on the cross, we died with Him and were terminated ([link]Rom. 6:6[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 5:14[/link]). Now, in our organic union with Christ through our faith in Him, He replaces us by living in us, with us, by us, and through us ([link]John 15:5[/link]; [link]Rom. 11:17[/link]; [link]Gal. 2:20[/link]; [link]Phil. 1:19-21a[/link]). Furthermore, God has replaced everything in His Old Testament economy with Christ ([link]Matt. 17:3-5[/link]; [link]Col. 2:16-17[/link]; [link]Heb. 10:5-14[/link]). Thus, the all-inclusive Christ as Immanuel ([link]7:14[/link]) replaces everything and becomes everything in God's economy.</note>

        <note num="1">Because Israel had become rebellious, God used the nations to discipline them. But the action of the nations was excessive; they went too far, overstepping the limit set by God. In assuming to be lords and acting as if they were the master, the nations went too far. Thus, God judges them and punishes them ([link]vv. 5[/link], [link]14[/link], [link]21[/link]; [link]24:21-22[/link]; [link]25:2-3[/link]; [link]27:1[/link]).[br][br]God's chastising of Israel and His judgment on the nations who exercise excessive action upon Israel issues in three things: (1) Israel is brought back to God; (2) the created things are restored; and (3) the all-inclusive Christ is ushered in. When Israel turns to God, there will be the restoration of all things. Then the all-inclusive Christ will be ushered in.

In the restoration the light of the sun will be sevenfold not for scorching but for shining, for giving sunshine to grow the living things on earth. This means that the heavens will answer the earth and cause it to grow things in a rich way ([link]Hosea 2:21-22[/link]). The sun's shining seven times brighter indicates that the produce of the earth will be seven times richer than it is in this age. At that time there will be no scarcity but rather plenitude.

        <note num="1">The first thirty-five chapters of this book concern God's loving chastisement on His beloved Israel and His righteous judgment on the nations, in order that His elect might turn to Him so that the created things might be restored and the all-inclusive Christ might be brought in. At this point, everyone and everything have been discharged by God, and Christ, the only One who is qualified, has come. In [link]chs. 36-39[/link] Isaiah provides an example in the person of Hezekiah, the king of Judah. In this example Isaiah shows how a person such as Hezekiah, who was appointed a king in God's kingdom, who was godly, and who prayed and received miraculous answers from God, eventually became not a success but a failure because of his self-glory and self-interest. Hence, he too was eventually discharged by God. See notes in [link]chs. 37-39[/link].</note>

        <note num="1">Hezekiah's use of this word indicates that he realized that he had been too hasty in the past and that his walk had not been proper in the sight of God. Thus, in his prayer he said that he would walk deliberately all his years. But when the visitors from Babylon came ([link]39:1-2[/link]), instead of walking in a deliberate way, he walked in a hasty way. See note [link]2[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 39[/link].</note>

        <note num="1">Hezekiah's showing the visitors from Babylon his treasury, his whole armory, and everything in his dominion was a foolish act and a great mistake. The showing of these riches became a temptation to Babylon. A little over one hundred years later, the king of Babylon came and took away those riches ([link]2 Kings 24-25[/link]). Hezekiah did not consider his action carefully, nor did he pray about it. He did not take thought concerning what the king of Babylon might do. This shows that Hezekiah was hasty and not very considerate or careful. Furthermore, his making a show offended God, who hates man's pride ([link]1 Pet. 5:5[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">Hezekiah's response to Isaiah's word indicates that he was selfish, caring only for himself. The kingdom of Judah, over which Hezekiah became king, was actually God's kingdom on earth, and Hezekiah should not have regarded it as his own kingdom (cf. note [link]6[sup]1[/sup] in 1 Sam. 31[/link]). For Hezekiah to lose his kingdom was a small thing, but for God to lose His kingdom was a great thing. Hezekiah's response in this verse indicates that he had no thought for God and God's kingdom, nor did he care even for his own children. He was altogether for himself.[br][br]The factors of Hezekiah's failure include (1) making a show of what he had, according to his flesh, (2) not being watchful, (3) not seeking the Lord, (4) not praying, (5) not considering the result of his actions, and (6) caring only for himself and not for God's kingdom on the earth.</note>

        <note num="1">Isaiah is a book of two main sections. The first section ([link]chs. 1-39[/link]) concerns God's governmental dealing with His beloved Israel and His punishing judgment on the nations so that Israel may be brought back to God and the all-inclusive Christ may be ushered in with the expected restoration of all things ([link]11:6-9[/link]; [link]35:5-6[/link]; cf. [link]Matt. 19:28[/link]; [link]10:1[/link]; [link]Rom. 8:19-23[/link]). The last section of Isaiah ([link]chs. 40-66[/link]) is the kind word of Jehovah spoken to the heart of Israel, His beloved people. This word unveils the prophet's vision concerning the redeeming and saving Christ as the Servant of Jehovah and reveals the all-inclusive salvation brought in by Christ to Israel and the nations, with the full restoration of all things, consummating in the new heaven and new earth.[br][br]The first thirty-nine chapters of Isaiah, corresponding to the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament, focus mainly on the old creation, whereas the last twenty-seven chapters, corresponding to the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, center on the new creation ([link]2 Cor. 5:17[/link]; [link]Gal. 6:15[/link]). Both this chapter and the New Testament begin with the coming of John the Baptist, who ushered in the expected Christ for the initiation of the new creation ([link]v. 3[/link]; [link]Mark 1:1-11[/link]). The coming of the new creation does not immediately end the old creation; rather, the old creation remains for a time, until it is terminated at the end of the millennium (cf. [link]2 Pet. 3:7[/link], [link]10-12[/link]). The end of the thousand-year kingdom will be the termination of the old creation as well as the completion, the consummation, of the new creation, which is signified by the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth ([link]2 Pet. 3:13[/link]; [link]Rev. 21:1-2[/link]).

        <note num="1">In this chapter the speaking of the word of comfort to the heart of Jerusalem ([link]vv. 1-2[/link]) is actually the announcing of the gospel (cf. [link]61:1-2[/link]; [link]Luke 4:18-19[/link]). The first thing announced is the coming of John the Baptist ([link]vv. 3-4[/link]). This is followed immediately by the appearing of Christ, the One recommended by John, as the glory of Jehovah ([link]v. 5[/link]). The glory of Jehovah is the center of the gospel for the new creation ([link]2 Cor. 4:4-6[/link]). Christ is the effulgence of God's glory ([link]Heb. 1:3[/link]), and this effulgence is like the shining of the sun ([link]Luke 1:78-79[/link]). Thus, when Christ appeared, the glory of Jehovah was revealed to be seen by the God-seekers and Christ-believers ([link]Matt. 17:1-2[/link], [link]5[/link]; [link]Luke 2:25-32[/link]; [link]9:32[/link]; [link]John 1:14[/link]; [link]2 Pet. 1:16-18[/link]). To those on whom Christ has shined, Christ is the glory of God and the hope of glory within them ([link]Col. 1:27[/link]).[br][br]In this chapter the coming Christ as the glad tidings is to be announced as Jehovah our God ([link]v. 3[/link]); as Jehovah of glory ([link]v. 5[/link]); as the Lord Jehovah coming with might to rule with His arm, having His reward with Him and His recompense before Him ([link]vv. 9-10[/link]); and as a Shepherd feeding His flock, gathering the lambs in His arms, carrying them in His bosom, and leading those who are nourishing the young ([link]v. 11[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">Jehovah is revealed through His speaking. Jesus was sent by God for the purpose of speaking the word of God for God's expression ([link]John 3:34a[/link]; [link]7:16[/link]; [link]14:24[/link]). In the word, the speaking, of Jesus, God is unveiled and presented to men that they may see God ([link]John 14:7-10[/link]; [link]Heb. 1:1-2[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">To wait on the eternal God ([link]v. 28[/link]) means that we terminate ourselves, i.e., that we stop ourselves with our living, our doing, and our activity, and receive God in Christ as our life, our person, and our replacement. Such a waiting one will be renewed and strengthened to such an extent that he will mount up with wings like eagles. He will not only walk and run but also soar in the heavens, far above every earthly frustration. This is a transformed person. This chapter leads us to a comparison between Hezekiah, a godly man who was still in the old creation ([link]chs. 36-39[/link]), and a regenerated and transformed person in the new creation.[br][br]In [link]Isa. 40[/link] there are the announcing of the gospel (corresponding to the four Gospels &amp;#8212; [link]vv. 1-5[/link]), salvation through regeneration (corresponding to the Acts &amp;#8212; [link]vv. 6-8[/link]), and transformation (corresponding to the Epistles &amp;#8212; [link]vv. 28-31[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">The eagles' wings signify the resurrection power of Christ, God's power in life, becoming our grace (cf. [link]1 Cor. 15:10[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 4:7[/link]; [link]12:9a[/link]). Those who stop themselves and wait on Jehovah will experience the power of resurrection, will be transformed, and will soar in the heavens (cf.

        <note num="1">In [link]chs. 41-66[/link] three parties are used by Isaiah to typify Christ as the Servant of Jehovah ([link]Matt. 12:15-21[/link]): Cyrus king of Persia, Israel, and Isaiah the prophet. These three servants and the all-inclusive Christ are one, serving Jehovah God for His good pleasure in releasing and raising up God's elect to build God's temple and God's city and to set up God's kingdom, which will be enlarged to consummate in the New Jerusalem.[br][br]In the first forty chapters of this book Isaiah unveiled in a hidden way God's economy, which is to have a people so that Christ as the embodiment of God can be expressed as everything, that He may be the centrality and the universality of everything in God's economy (see note [link]25[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 22[/link]). God in Christ and Christ with God have reached this point, i.e., to have Christ expressed as God's centrality and universality, to such an extent that these three parties &amp;#8212; Cyrus the Gentile king, the pitiful Israel, and Isaiah &amp;#8212; became one with Christ that God might have a corporate expression. Everyone who is one with Christ, including the New Testament believers, is a type of Christ, who is the Servant of God, and such persons also are servants of God because they are part of Christ. All other persons have been terminated, put aside by God. Those who are one with Christ have become a great corporate Christ ([link]1 Cor. 12:12[/link]; [link]Col. 3:10-11[/link]), the same as the individual Christ in being the testimony and servant of God.</note>

Israel also typifies Christ as the Witness of Jehovah ([link]43:10[/link]; [link]Rev. 1:5a[/link]; [link]3:14[/link]).

The source of Christ as the Servant of Jehovah is His divinity, His deity ([link]vv. 1[/link], [link]6[/link]; [link]49:5[/link], [link]7-8[/link]), whereas His qualification is in His humanity, in His human virtues ([link]vv. 2-4[/link]). Christ's commission is to raise up the tribes of Jacob; to bring Jacob back to Jehovah so that Israel would be gathered to Him ([link]49:5b[/link], [link]6a[/link]); to be a covenant of the people, i.e., of Israel ([link]v. 6d[/link]; [link]49:8d[/link]); to restore the land ([link]49:8e[/link]); to be a light to the nations ([link]v. 6e[/link]; [link]49:6c[/link]); to bring forth justice for salvation in truth to the nations ([link]vv. 1[/link], [link]3b[/link]; [link]49:6d[/link]); to open the eyes of the blind that they may see the divine and spiritual things concerning God's eternal economy ([link]v. 7a[/link]; [link]Luke 4:18b[/link]; [link]Acts 26:18a[/link]); and to bring the prisoner out from the prison, those who dwell in darkness out from the prison house, that they may be released from the dark kingdom of Satan into the kingdom of God's beloved Son ([link]v. 7[/link]; [link]Col. 1:12-13[/link]).</note>

In this book it refers to salvation as the result of God's judgment on Christ, the righteous One, which was executed according to God's righteous law and completely fulfills all the requirements of that law (cf. [link]Gal. 2:19[/link] and note 1). To establish justice in the earth means to establish God's salvation as the issue of God's judgment on Christ. God's salvation is of two aspects &amp;#8212; justification as the judicial aspect and the impartation of life as the organic aspect ([link]Rom. 5:10[/link], [link]18[/link]). God justifies and imparts life to the believers based on Christ's redemption accomplished through God's righteous judgment; this is justice. Christ will come again when He finishes the establishing of God's justice, God's salvation, in this earth.</note>

        <text>I am Jehovah; I have [xref]a[/xref]called You in righteousness; / I have held You by the hand; / I have kept You and I have given You / As a [note]1[/note][xref]b[/xref]covenant for the people, as a [note]2[/note][xref]c[/xref]light for the nations;</text>
        <note num="1">Christ has been called by Jehovah to be a covenant for the people, i.e., for Israel ([link]v. 6b[/link]; [link]49:8b[/link]; [link]Heb. 7:22[/link]). The covenant is the legal agreement between God and His people (cf. [link]Jer. 31:31-34[/link]; [link]Heb. 8:8-12[/link]). Through the death of Christ, the covenant became a testament, a will ([link]Heb. 9:16-17[/link] and note [link]16[sup]1[/sup][/link]). Christ enacted the new covenant (which became the new testament &amp;#8212; the will) with His blood according to God's righteousness through His redeeming death ([link]Matt. 26:28[/link]; [link]Luke 22:20[/link]; [link]Heb. 9:15[/link]). In resurrection Christ became the reality of all the bequests of the new testament and the Mediator, the Executor, to execute the new testament according to God's righteousness ([link]Heb. 8:6[/link]; [link]9:15[/link]; [link]12:24[/link]). Therefore, Christ is the new covenant as the new testament.[br][br]Christ, as the embodiment of the riches of the Godhead ([link]Col. 2:9[/link]; [link]1:19[/link]) and as the crucified and resurrected One, has become the covenant of God given to His people. He is the reality of all that God is and of all that God has given us. God's salvation, God's righteousness, God's justification, God's forgiveness, God's redemption, God's riches, and all God has and will do have been covenanted to us. As the reality of all the bequests in the new testament, Christ, who is the all-inclusive, life-giving, indwelling, consummated Spirit ([link]1 Cor. 15:45[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 3:17[/link]; [link]Rom. 8:9-11[/link]), is in our spirit and has become one spirit with us ([link]2 Tim. 4:22[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 6:17[/link]). As a covenant Christ is the surety ([link]Heb. 7:22[/link]), and the Spirit is the pledge ([link]2 Cor. 1:22[/link]; [link]Eph. 1:14[/link]), to guarantee that God embodied in Christ is the inheritance to His people ([link]Rom. 8:17a[/link]; [link]Acts 26:18[/link] and note 6).</note>
        <note num="2">Christ has also been called by Jehovah to be a light for the nations ([link]v. 6b[/link]; [link]Matt. 4:13-16[/link]). He is the light of life, the true light, that shines over the world and enlightens every man to enliven man for regeneration ([link]John 1:4[/link], [link]9[/link], [link]12-13[/link]). He is the divine, marvelous light to open the eyes of the blind ([link]v. 7a[/link]; [link]Luke 4:18[/link]; [link]John 9:14[/link]) and to deliver God's chosen people out of the darkness of death, the death-realm, the authority of Satan, into God's life-realm of light ([link]v. 7b[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 2:9b[/link]; [link]Acts 26:18a[/link]; [link]Col. 1:12-13[/link]). Christ as the covenant is for God's people to gain God with His riches as their inheritance (see note [link]6[sup]1[/sup][/link]), whereas Christ as the light is for God's people to receive God as life. See note [link]6[sup]2[/sup] in ch. 49[/link].</note>

        <note num="1">Israel is God's servant in the sense of fulfilling God's desire in His economy to have a corporate expression of Himself for His glory ([link]41:8[/link]; [link]45:4[/link]; [link]49:3[/link]). The people of Israel were to be used by God to express Him in a corporate way for His glorification. In this sense Israel was one with Christ as God's servant ([link]Hosea 11:1[/link]; cf. [link]Matt. 2:15[/link]). The servant of Jehovah is corporate, and Israel was part of this corporate servant. See notes [link chapter="41"]1[sup]1[/sup][/link] and [link]8[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 41[/link].[br][br]In the present age the church is the testimony of God in the sense of being one with Christ as God's testimony ([link]Rev. 1:2[/link] and note). In being such a testimony, the church serves God. Thus, all God's elect can be considered servants of God with Christ for the expression of God's glory (cf. [link]John 17:22[/link]; [link]Eph. 3:21[/link]). The glorification of God is the purpose of our service. The highest service we can render to God is to express His glory.</note>

        <note num="1">In [link]chs. 43-45[/link] Christ as the Servant of Jehovah is typified by Cyrus king of Persia, who was Jehovah's Shepherd and who fulfilled all the desires of Jehovah. Cyrus served God by defeating Babylon, God's enemy ([link]48:14[/link]), which had captured His people and destroyed the temple ([link]2 Kings 24-25[/link]), by declaring the release of Israel from captivity, and by issuing a decree allowing the Jews to rebuild their temple in Jerusalem ([link]45:13[/link]; [link]Ezra 1:2-3[/link]). These three things are types, signifying Christ's defeating Satan ([link]Heb. 2:14[/link]), releasing His believers from Satan's captivity ([link]Luke 4:18b[/link]; [link]Eph. 4:8[/link]), and building up the church as God's temple ([link]Matt. 16:18[/link]; [link]Eph. 2:21[/link]).

Isaiah served Jehovah as His mouthpiece to speak forth His word, which is the embodiment of Himself ([link]vv. 1-4[/link]). Isaiah's prophesying helped in the release of Israel and the rebuilding of the temple and the city. Cyrus, the Gentile king, Israel, God's chosen people, and Isaiah, the prophet set up by God, all did the same thing to please God: they served to release God's people, to build up God's house, and to build up God's kingdom, signified by the city of Jerusalem. Thus, they all typify Christ as God's servant ([link]Luke 4:18[/link]; [link]Matt. 16:18-19[/link]). All who are in Christ ([link]1 Cor. 1:30[/link]) and who are thus one with Christ to release God's people and to build up His house and His kingdom are servants of God.</note>

        <note num="1">Jehovah considered the prophet Isaiah as His servant, a part of Israel, for His glorification. Isaiah was a part of Israel; hence, he was one with Israel as the servant of Jehovah. Christ also is a part of Israel ([link]Hosea 11:1[/link]; [link]Matt. 2:15b[/link]). That Jehovah will be glorified in His servant typifies that God is glorified in Christ ([link]John 13:31b[/link]) as the Israel of God. See note [link]7[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 43[/link].</note>

        <note num="1">Here Isaiah typifies Christ. People judged Christ wrongly, thinking that His word was nothing and vain. However, Christ was assured that the justice due to Him would come from God ([link]1 Pet. 2:23[/link]). God values Christ's word (cf.

        <note num="2">Christ as the Servant of Jehovah serves God by being a covenant and a light to God's chosen people that He may be the full salvation of God extending to the ends of the earth ([link]42:5-7[/link]; [link]49:6[/link], [link]8b-9a[/link]). God's full salvation is based on God's righteousness and is consummated in God's life ([link]Rom. 5:17[/link], [link]21[/link]). Righteousness in God's justice and life through God's light are the two basic factors of God's salvation ([link]Rom. 1:16-17[/link]; [link]5:18b[/link]; [link]Titus 3:7[/link]). God's salvation in its two aspects is composed of Christ as the covenant for justification and Christ as the light for life ([link]Rom. 5:10[/link]). Through His death Christ as the covenant satisfies God's righteousness for justification as the base of God's full salvation, and in His resurrection Christ as the light imparts life as the consummation of God's full salvation. Ultimately, the complete salvation of God is embodied in the New Jerusalem, which is a matter of life built on the foundation of righteousness ([link]Rev. 22:1-2[/link]; [link]21:14[/link], [link]19-20[/link] and note [link]19[sup]1[/sup][/link], par. 2).[br][br]Through His death and in His resurrection Christ has become the new covenant as the new testament ([link]Heb. 8:10-12[/link]; [link]9:15-17[/link]) according to God's righteousness to be the base of God's full salvation. God gave Christ as a light to the nations that He might be God's salvation to all the world ([link]Matt. 4:16[/link]; [link]Luke 2:30-32[/link]). The life of this light ([link]John 1:4[/link]; [link]8:32[/link]), as the indestructible life ([link]Heb. 7:16b[/link]), the incorruptible life ([link]2 Tim. 1:10b[/link]), and the real and eternal life that we should lay hold on ([link]1 Tim. 6:19[/link], [link]12[/link]), becomes God's salvation to us in His righteousness ([link]Rom. 5:10[/link], [link]17[/link]). This life also ensures us, guarantees us, the heirs of God in His life, the right to inherit God with all His riches as our eternal inheritance ([link]Acts 26:18[/link]). Such a life of light grows in us continually, issuing in our church life today ([link]Eph. 5:8[/link]) and consummating in the New Jerusalem in eternity ([link]Rev. 21:2-3[/link], [link]9b-11[/link], [link]18-23[/link]; [link]22:1-5[/link]).</note>

The entire chapter is a confession that will be made by the household of Israel who will be saved at Christ's second coming ([link]Zech. 12:10[/link]; [link]Rom. 11:26-27[/link]).

        <note num="1">The first part of this verse concerns Christ in His ascension. [i]The Great and the Strong[/i] here refer to God. In Christ's ascension God divided to Christ a portion with God as the great One, and Christ divided the spoil with God as the strong One.</note>
        <note num="2">[i]Spoil[/i] indicates that a war was fought. On the cross and in His resurrection Christ fought the battle, gained the victory, and took the spoil from Satan (see note [link]8[sup]2[/sup] in Eph. 4[/link]). In Christ's ascension there was a demonstration of Christ's victory by the sharing of the captives, the spoil, taken in Christ's victory. As the ascended Victor, Christ shared the spoil of His victory with God, the Great and the Strong ([link]Psa. 68:18[/link] and note 3). Then Christ gave the spoil to the church as gifts for the building up of the Body of Christ ([link]Eph. 4:8b[/link], [link]11-12[/link] and note [link]8[sup]3[/sup][/link]). This is for the accomplishing of the pleasure of Jehovah, which will prosper in Christ's hand according to God's desire and plan ([link]v. 10c[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">In [link]chs. 55-56[/link] Christ, as the Servant of Jehovah and the embodiment of the Triune God as the living waters ([link]John 4:10[/link], [link]14[/link]; [link]7:37-38[/link]), is an eternal covenant to Israel ([link]42:6[/link]; [link]49:8[/link]; [link]54:10[/link]; [link]61:8b[/link]), even the sure mercies shown to David, in relation to Israel's prosperity. As such, He is the center of the divine provisions to Israel ([link]vv. 1-5[/link]). See note [link]6[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 42[/link].</note>
        <note num="2">In [link]Acts 13:34[/link] Paul interprets the sure mercies as "the holy things of David, the faithful things," and in [link]v. 35[/link] there, he indicates that these things are Christ Himself in resurrection (see note [link]34[sup]1[/sup] in Acts 13[/link]). Paul's interpretation is confirmed by [link]v. 4[/link] in this chapter. Christ was incarnated to bring God as grace to us ([link]John 1:14[/link], [link]16-17[/link]), and He was crucified and resurrected to become the sure mercies to us in resurrection. Because our situation was miserable and could not match God's grace, Christ, the embodiment of God's grace, became the sure mercies, and through these mercies we are now in the proper position to match God and receive Him as grace (cf. [link]Eph. 2:4[/link] and note 2). In Christ as the sure mercies, God reaches us in His grace to be our enjoyment. Christ is both the sure mercies and the eternal covenant that guarantees these mercies.[br][br]As the sure mercies of God, the resurrected Christ became the base of God's justification to His believers ([link]Acts 13:34-39[/link]; [link]Rom. 4:25[/link]). Based on such a justification in Christ's resurrection, the believers can be sanctified by enjoying Christ, the son of David ([link]Matt. 1:1[/link]), as God's sure mercies, i.e., as the Holy One who did not see corruption ([link]Acts 13:35[/link]).</note>
        <note num="3">David and all the kings in David's family needed God's mercy ([link]Psa. 51:1[/link]; [link]52:8b[/link]). God promised that the very Christ, who would come out of David's descendants to be the King of kings on the earth ([link]Rev. 17:14[/link]; [link]19:16[/link]), would be the sure mercies of God toward the royal family of David. Because of Christ as the sure mercies of God, no one could blot out the entire royal family of David (see note [link]1[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 11[/link]; cf. [link]Jer. 33:24-26[/link]). The last king of the royal family of David will be Jesus Christ, the embodiment of God's sure mercies.</note>

        <note num="1">The real meaning of fasting is to stop eating all things other than the Lord Jesus and to not have a taste for anything other than Him.

By resting and fasting we can partake of all that the processed Christ has accomplished for us. In totality, what Christ is and has accomplished is just the divine water ([link]55:1[/link]), which is the consummated Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God for us to drink and enjoy ([link]John 7:37-39[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 12:13[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">[link]Verses 1-3[/link] refer to the ministry of Christ as the Anointed of Jehovah in His two comings. As indicated in [link]Luke 4:16-22a[/link] (see notes there), [link book="Isa." chapter="60"]vv. 1-2a[/link] in this chapter refer to Christ in His first coming, in which His ministry was to announce the gospel of grace. [link]Verses 2b-3[/link] refer to Christ in His second coming, in which His ministry will be to avenge Israel that they may be restored. The prophecy concerning Christ as the Anointed of Jehovah was fulfilled as a foretaste at Christ's first coming, for the age of grace as the acceptable year of Jehovah, the New Testament jubilee (see note [link]10[sup]1[/sup], par. 2, in Lev. 25[/link]), resulting in the producing and building up of the church. This prophecy will be fulfilled as a full taste at Christ's second coming, for the restoration of Israel unto the new heavens and new earth ([link]65:17[/link]; [link]66:22[/link]).[br][br]Christ's coming is of two parts and at two times. In His first coming, Christ came to minister, to dispense, Himself into His followers. In this way He carried out the New Testament ministry to dispense the Triune God into the disciples under His ministry, most of whom were Jews. This ministry in Christ's first coming laid a solid foundation for His second coming. When He comes the second time, He will come mainly in an outward way to rescue Israel from their circumstances and to bring in their restoration ([link]Zech. 12-14[/link]). This restoration will be expanded to include all things created by God ([link]2:2-5[/link]; [link]11:6-9[/link]; [link]30:26[/link]; [link]35:1-10[/link]; [link]65:25[/link]). It will last for a millennium, for the thousand-year kingdom ([link]Rev. 20:2-7[/link]).[br][br]In the eyes of God, Christ's two comings are two aspects of one unique coming of Christ from God to mankind. Hence, in Isaiah's prophecy these two comings are like two mountain peaks which, when viewed from a distance, seem to be one peak. For this reason Isaiah viewed Christ's first coming and second coming as being together.</note>
        <note num="2">The Spirit of Jehovah was upon Christ in His first coming ([link]Matt. 3:16[/link]; [link]Luke 4:18a[/link]) and will be upon Him in His second coming. When the Lord Jesus comes the second time, the striking significance will be that the Spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon Him, the word [i]Lord[/i] being especially added here by Isaiah.</note>

Christ as the Anointed of Jehovah will come to tread the winepress to save Israel from the nations ([link]vv. 1-6[/link]). During the last three and a half years of this age, the time of the great tribulation ([link]Matt. 24:21[/link]), Antichrist will persecute the Jews to the uttermost, with the intention of completely destroying Israel. Prior to that time, nearly all Israel will be brought back to the Holy Land. Then, before the tribulation Antichrist will make a seven-year covenant of peace with Israel so that they may have their freedom ([link]Dan. 9:27[/link]). But after three and a half years, Antichrist will change his mind and will oppose every kind of religion ([link]Dan. 11:36[/link]). After destroying Catholicism ([link]Rev. 17:16-18[/link]), Antichrist will attempt to destroy the Jewish religion. At the end of the last three and a half years, Antichrist will cause the armies of the nations to surround Jerusalem. With Jerusalem as the center, the entire region from Bozrah to the Mount of Megiddo (Armageddon &amp;#8212; [link]Rev. 16:16[/link]) will be occupied by armies. In His coming back, Christ, with His overcomers as His bride, will descend to Bozrah ([link]v. 1[/link]), and beginning there He will tread the winepress, destroying all the armies. In this way He will rescue Israel from destruction. See [link]Rev. 14:17-20[/link]; [link]16:16[/link]; and [link]19:11-21[/link], and notes on those verses.</note>

        <note num="1">According to [link]v. 17[/link] and [link]66:22-24[/link], the restoration of Israel and of all things brought in by Christ as the Servant of Jehovah consummates in the new heaven and new earth. After so many things have passed away, what will remain will be the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem ([link]2 Pet. 3:10-13[/link]; [link]Rev. 21:1-2[/link]).[br][br]In the millennial kingdom the Jews will be priests on the earth ([link]2:2-3[/link]; [link]Zech. 8:20-23[/link]), and the overcoming believers will be priests in the heavens ([link]Rev. 20:6[/link]). At that time the holy city, New Jerusalem, will comprise only the overcoming Old Testament and New Testament saints but not the Israelites who will be saved at the Lord's coming back. At the end of the millennium Satan will stir up opposers, mainly from Gog and Magog, to attack the camp of the Jews and the city of the saints, but fire will come down out of heaven to devour them ([link]Rev. 20:9[/link]). In the new heaven and new earth after the millennium, the Jews who were saved at the coming of the Lord Jesus will be mingled with the New Jerusalem. Therefore, in the new heaven and new earth, there will be only two peoples. First, there will be the New Jerusalem, composed of both the New Testament believers and the Old Testament saints ([link]Rev. 21:12[/link], [link]14[/link]), who will be God's sons as the royal family to rule over the nations and as the priests to serve God forever ([link]Rev. 21:7[/link]; [link]22:3[/link], [link]5[/link]), and second, there will be the nations, who will not be regenerated but only restored and who will live on the new earth outside the New Jerusalem to be God's people ([link]Rev. 21:3[/link], [link]24-26[/link]; [link]22:2b[/link]).</note>

God was united with the children of Israel and became one entity with them, and this one entity was a spiritual house in which both God and the godly people in Israel dwelt ([link]Psa. 27:4[/link]; [link]84:10[/link]; [link]90:1[/link]; cf. [link]1 Pet. 2:5a[/link]). According to [link]v. 2[/link] and [link]57:15[/link], the dwelling place God desires to have is a group of people into whom He can enter. God intends to have a dwelling place in the universe that is the mingling of God and man, in which God is built into man and man is built into God, so that God and man, man and God, can be a mutual abode to each other ([link]John 14:2[/link], [link]20[/link], [link]23[/link]; [link]15:4[/link]; [link]1 John 4:13[/link]). In the New Testament this dwelling place, this house, is the church, which is God's habitation in the believers' spirit ([link]Eph. 2:22[/link] and note 4; [link]1 Tim. 3:15[/link] and note 2). The ultimate manifestation of this universal building, this universal house, is the New Jerusalem. In this city God is in man, taking man as His dwelling place, and man is in God, taking God as His habitation ([link]Rev. 21:3[/link], [link]22[/link], and notes). See note [link]12[sup]1[/sup] in Gen. 28[/link] and notes in [link]2 Sam. 7:12-14[/link].</note>
