        <note num="1">The divine revelation in the Bible is progressive, advancing continually from Genesis to Revelation. Genesis reveals God's creation and man's fall, and Exodus reveals God's salvation and the building of God's habitation. As a further advancement of the divine revelation, Leviticus unveils the worship and living of God's redeemed people. While Israel remained with God at Sinai for approximately eleven months ([link]Exo. 19:1[/link]; cf. [link]Num. 10:11[/link]), God trained them to worship and partake of Him for their enjoyment and to live a holy, clean, and rejoicing life. This book shows that through the tabernacle, with the offerings, and by the priests, God's redeemed are able to fellowship with God, serve God, and be God's holy people living a holy life, which expresses God. Christ is everything in the fellowship, service, and life of God's people. The worship portrayed in Leviticus is a matter of contacting God by enjoying Christ as the common portion with God and with one another (cf. [link]John 4:24[/link] and notes). The issue of enjoying Christ with God is the holy living of God's people.</note>
        <note num="2">The first and last verses of Leviticus indicate that the entire book is a record of God's speaking. The speaking that began here took place not in the heavens nor on Mount Sinai but in the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting. In type this signifies that God speaks in the church as His tabernacle (cf. [link]1 Cor. 3:16[/link]; [link]14:23-31[/link]). The church as the Tent of Meeting is the unique oracle, the unique place of God's speaking.</note>
        <note num="3">The tabernacle was God's dwelling place ([link]Exo. 40:34-35[/link]), and the Tent of Meeting was the place where God and His redeemed people met (cf. [link]Exo. 25:22[/link]; [link]33:7[/link]). Both refer to the church, which is God's dwelling place on earth ([link]1 Tim. 3:15[/link]) and also a meeting place for the saved ones to meet with the saving God (cf. [link]1 Cor. 14:23-25[/link]).</note>

        <text>Speak to the children of Israel and say to them, When any one of you presents an [note]1[/note]offering to Jehovah, you shall present your offering from the [note]2[/note]cattle, of the herd or of the flock.</text>
        <note num="1">Heb. [i]qorban,[/i] meaning [i]a present,[/i] or [i]a gift.[/i] Strictly, the offerings are not sacrifices but presents given to God by the appreciators of Christ. Sacrifices are for redemption, for propitiation, whereas presents are gifts for intimate fellowship between us and God. The children of Israel were to labor on the good land and then offer to God as presents the produce they enjoyed and appreciated. Likewise, we should endeavor to experience and enjoy Christ and then offer Christ to God as a present with much appreciation. The tabernacle is for God to dwell in, and the offerings are for God to enjoy with us through our appreciation and presentation.[br][br]Exodus ends with the erecting of the tabernacle ([link]Exo. 40[/link]), and Leviticus begins with the offerings ([link]chs. 1-7[/link]), implying a direct continuation between the two books. Both the tabernacle and the offerings are types of Christ. Through incarnation Christ came to be the tabernacle ([link]John 1:14[/link]). This same Christ is also the Lamb of God ([link]John 1:29[/link]), the totality, the aggregate, of all the offerings ([link]Heb. 10:5-10[/link]). Christ came in incarnation to bring God to us ([link]John 1:1-13:38[/link]), and He passed through crucifixion and resurrection to bring us to God ([link]John 14:1-21:25[/link]), making God one with us and us one with God. The tabernacle signifies that God is in Christ that we may contact, experience, enter into, and join to God. The offerings signify God in Christ for us to enjoy and even to eat, digest, and assimilate ([link]John 6:53-58[/link]) that we may be mingled with God. The way to enjoy Christ as the reality of all the offerings is to contact Him and take Him in as the Spirit of reality ([link]John 6:63[/link]; [link]14:16-18[/link], [link]20[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 15:45[/link]).[br][br]According to Leviticus, there are five main kinds of offerings: the burnt offering ([link]1:1-17[/link]), the meal offering ([link]2:1-16[/link]), the peace offering ([link]3:1-17[/link]), the sin offering ([link]4:1-35[/link]), and the trespass offering ([link]5:1-6:7[/link]). The functions of these offerings were (1) as sacrifices for sin, to make expiation for God's people by appeasing the situation between God and His people, (2) as gifts to please God, and (3) as food for God and for His serving ones, the priests.</note>
        <note num="2">All the kinds of cattle used in burnt offerings in this chapter were living animals that move and act according to their will. Christ was such a living one, with a strong will but with His will subdued to be subject to God. He never became blemished ([link]v. 3[/link]) because His will was always subdued to be subject to God's will ([link]John 5:30[/link]; [link]6:38[/link]). As the burnt offering Christ went to the cross in order to do the will of God ([link]Heb. 10:5-10[/link] and note [link]7[sup]2[/sup][/link]).</note>

        <verse num="3">
        <text>If his offering is a [note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]burnt offering from the herd, he shall present it, a [note]2[/note]male [xref]b[/xref]without [note]2[/note]blemish; he shall present it at the [note]3[/note]entrance of the Tent of Meeting, that he may be accepted before Jehovah.</text>
        <note num="1">The Hebrew word literally means [i]that which goes up[/i] and denotes something that ascends to God. The burnt offering typifies Christ not mainly in His redeeming man from sin but in His living a life that is perfect and absolutely for God and for God's satisfaction ([link]v. 9[/link]; [link]John 5:19[/link], [link]30[/link]; [link]6:38[/link]; [link]7:18[/link]; [link]8:29[/link]; [link]14:24[/link]) and in His being the life that enables God's people to have such a living ([link]2 Cor. 5:15[/link]; [link]Gal. 2:19-20[/link]). It is God's food that God may enjoy it and be satisfied ([link]Num. 28:2[/link]). This offering was to be offered daily, in the morning and in the evening ([link]Exo. 29:38-42[/link]; [link]Lev. 6:8-13[/link]; [link]Num. 28:3-4[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">As the burnt offering Christ is full of strength (a male) and freshness (young &amp;#8212; [link]v. 5[/link]), and He is without defects and faults ([link]1 Pet. 1:19[/link]; [link]Heb. 9:14[/link]).</note>
        <note num="3">The burnt offering was offered at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, i.e., in the outer court of the tabernacle. The outer court signifies the earth (cf. note [link]9[sup]2[/sup] in Rev. 6[/link]), and the altar signifies the cross. The cross on which Christ offered Himself was on earth, but His offering of Himself was before God, and He was accepted by God and before God.</note>

        <text>And he shall [xref]a[/xref]lay his [note]1[/note]hand on the head of the burnt offering, and it shall be accepted for him, to make [note]2[/note][xref]b[/xref]expiation for him.</text>
        <note num="1">The laying on of hands signifies not substitution but identification, union ([link]Acts 13:3[/link] and note 2). By laying our hands on Christ as our offering, we are joined to Him, and He and we become one. In such a union all our weaknesses, defects, and faults are taken on by Him, and all His virtues become ours. This requires us to exercise our spirit through the proper prayer so that we may be one with Him in an experiential way (cf. [link]1 Cor. 6:17[/link] and notes). When we lay our hands on Christ through prayer, the life-giving Spirit, who is the very Christ on whom we lay our hands ([link]1 Cor. 15:45[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 3:6[/link], [link]17[/link]), will immediately move and work within us to live in us a life that is a repetition of the life that Christ lived on earth, the life of the burnt offering.</note>
        <note num="2">Although the burnt offering is not for redemption, it nevertheless makes expiation for the offerer (see note [link]1[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 16[/link]). For this reason, the burnt offering must be a life that has blood to shed for expiation ([link]Heb. 9:22[/link]). Because we are not absolutely for God, we need Christ as our burnt offering to appease our situation with God that we may have peace with Him. Because the burnt offering is for expiation, it can be eaten only by God ([link]v. 9[/link]; [link]6:30[/link]). We are not qualified to eat it.</note>

        <note num="2">God trained His elect to worship and partake of Him through the priests ([link]1:5-8[/link]; [link]2:2[/link]; [link]3:2[/link]; [link]4:5[/link], [link]10[/link]; [link]5:8[/link]). The priests typify Christ as God's Priest ([link]Heb. 5:5-6[/link]), who offered Himself to God for us ([link]Heb. 9:14[/link], [link]26[/link]; [link]10:10[/link]). Christ is both the offerings and the Priest. He is the unique way for God's people to worship and enjoy God.</note>

        <text>And he shall [note]1[/note]skin the burnt offering and [note]2[/note]cut it into its pieces.</text>
        <note num="1">The skin of the burnt offering is the outward expression of its beauty. Hence, to skin the offering is to strip it of its outward expression. As the burnt offering, Christ was "skinned," stripped of the outward appearance of His human virtues ([link]Matt. 11:19[/link]; [link]Mark 3:22[/link]; [link]John 8:48[/link]; [link]Matt. 26:65[/link]; [link]27:28[/link]; cf. [link]Psa. 22:18[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">The cutting of the offering into pieces signifies that Christ was willing to let His entire being be broken without any reservation. In His living as the burnt offering, Christ's whole being and His entire life were cut into pieces ([link]Mark 15:29-32[/link]; [link]Luke 23:35-39[/link]; cf. [link]Psa. 22:16-17[/link]). The cutting of the offering into pieces by the offerer indicates that his experience, apprehension, realization, and appreciation of Christ are deep and detailed.</note>

        <note num="1">The head of the burnt offering typifies Christ's wisdom; the fat signifies His being a delight to God ([link]Matt. 3:17[/link]; [link]12:18[/link]; [link]17:5[/link]); the inward parts ([link]v. 9[/link]) denote Christ's inward parts, including His mind, emotion, will, and heart with all their functions; and the legs ([link]v. 9[/link]) signify Christ's walk.</note>

        <note num="1">The washing of the inward parts and the legs of the burnt offering does not imply that Christ was dirty; rather, it indicates that Christ's inward parts and His daily walk were continually being washed by the Holy Spirit, signified by the water ([link]John 7:38-39[/link]), to keep Him from becoming defiled by His contact with earthly things.[br][br]In order to offer Christ to God as our burnt offering, we need to experience Him in His experiences and offer Him to God according to our experiences of Him ([link]1 Pet. 2:5[/link]; [link]Heb. 13:15[/link]). In particular, we need to experience Him in His being slaughtered ([link]Rom. 8:36[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 4:11[/link]), skinned ([link]Matt. 5:11[/link]; [link]Acts 24:5-6[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 6:8[/link]; [link]12:16-18[/link]), and cut into pieces ([link]1 Cor. 4:13[/link]). We also need to experience Him in His wisdom ([link]1 Cor. 1:24[/link], [link]30[/link]; [link]2:7[/link]; [link]Col. 1:26-27[/link]), in His being a delight to God ([link]2 Cor. 5:9[/link]; [link]Gal. 1:10[/link]; [link]Rom. 14:18[/link]), in His inward parts ([link]Phil. 2:5[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 2:16b[/link]; [link]16:24[/link]; [link]Phil. 1:8[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 11:10[/link]), in His walk ([link]Matt. 11:29[/link]; [link]Eph. 4:20[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 11:1[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 2:21[/link]), and in His being kept by the Holy Spirit from defilement ([link]1 Cor. 6:11[/link]; [link]Titus 3:5[/link]). Experiencing Christ in His experiences is not a matter of imitating Christ outwardly but a matter of living Him in our daily life ([link]Gal. 2:20[/link]; [link]Phil. 1:21[/link]). The way in which we offer Christ as the burnt offering is actually a display and review of our daily experience of Christ. See note [link]14[sup]1[/sup][/link].</note>

        <note num="3">The fire signifies the holy God ([link]Heb. 12:29[/link]). With the burnt offering, the fire was not for judgment but for acceptance by God. This fire was to burn continually day and night ([link]6:9[/link], [link]12-13[/link]).</note>
        <note num="4">As the burnt offering Christ lived a life that was absolutely for God's satisfaction ([link]John 5:30[/link]; [link]6:38[/link]; [link]8:29[/link]), a life that was pure and holy, with no element of the fall, no defect, and no sin ([link]John 14:30[/link]; [link]Luke 23:14[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 5:21[/link]; [link]Heb. 4:15[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 1:19[/link]; [link]2:22[/link]).

        <note num="1">Offering the burnt offering at the Tent of Meeting typifies the offering of Christ to God in the church meetings. The various kinds of burnt offerings ([link]vv. 3-9[/link], [link]10-13[/link], [link]14-17[/link]) differed both in size and in the way they were offered. The different sizes of burnt offerings signify not that Christ in Himself varies but that the offerers' experience, apprehension, realization, and appreciation of Christ differ in degree. The first two categories of burnt offerings &amp;#8212; the bull and the sheep or goat &amp;#8212; were offered in the same way: the preparing of the offering was done by the offerer; the priest's function was only to sprinkle the blood on and around the altar and arrange the pieces of the offering on the fire. However, with the offerings in the third category, the offerer simply brought the offering to the Tent of Meeting; the priest did everything else. Those who offered a bull or a sheep or a goat signify the mature believers who experience and appreciate Christ in a deep and detailed way and have the spiritual ability to offer Christ in a processed way. Those who offered a turtledove or a pigeon signify believers who are young in spiritual age and who have limited experience and appreciation of Christ.</note>

        <note num="1">The meal offering typifies Christ in His human living. The emphasis of the burnt offering ([link]ch. 1[/link]) is on Christ's living for God, being obedient to God even unto death ([link]Phil. 2:8[/link]), implying His living but emphasizing His death. The emphasis of the meal offering is on Christ's human living and daily walk, implying His death but emphasizing His living (see note [link]13[sup]1[/sup][/link]). The burnt offering emphasizes that Christ is the righteousness of God ([link]1 Cor. 1:30[/link]; cf. [link]2 Cor. 5:21[/link]), whereas the meal offering emphasizes that Christ is righteous before God ([link]1 John 2:1[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">Fine flour, the main element of the meal offering, signifies Christ's humanity, which is fine, perfect, tender, balanced, and right in every way, with no excess and no deficiency. This signifies the beauty and excellence of Christ's human living and daily walk. The fine flour of the meal offering was produced out of wheat that had passed through many processes, which signify the various sufferings of Christ that made Him "a man of sorrows" ([link]Isa. 53:3[/link]).[br][br]In contrast to the burnt offering, nothing of the animal life, but only the vegetable life, is seen in the meal offering. As a type of Christ, the vegetable life indicates the produce, the propagation, and the increase for the supplying of life to people.</note>
        <note num="3">The oil of the meal offering signifies the Spirit of God as the divine element of Christ (see note [link]18[sup]3[/sup] in 1 Pet. 3[/link]). In the meal offering the oil was mingled with the fine flour ([link]vv. 4-5[/link]) and poured upon it ([link]vv. 1[/link], [link]6[/link], [link]15[/link]) to anoint it ([link]v. 4[/link]), signifying that the Spirit of God as Christ's divinity was mingled with His humanity ([link]Matt. 1:18[/link], [link]20[/link]; [link]Luke 1:35[/link]) and that the Spirit was poured upon Him ([link]Matt. 3:16[/link]; [link]John 1:32[/link]) to anoint Him ([link]Luke 4:18[/link]; [link]Heb. 1:9[/link]). This is a picture of the two aspects of Christ's experience of the Spirit of God.</note>
        <note num="4">The frankincense in the meal offering signifies the fragrance of Christ in His resurrection. That the frankincense was put on the fine flour signifies that Christ's humanity bears the aroma of His resurrection (cf. [link]Matt. 11:20-30[/link]; [link]Luke 10:21[/link]). As portrayed in the four Gospels, Christ lived a life in His humanity mingled with His divinity and expressing resurrection out from His sufferings (cf. [link]John 18:4-8[/link]; [link]19:26-27a[/link]). Christ was always filled with the Spirit and saturated with resurrection ([link]Luke 4:1[/link]; [link]John 11:25[/link]).</note>

And the priest shall burn [i]it as[/i] its [note]1[/note]memorial portion on the altar, an offering by [note]2[/note]fire, a satisfying [xref]b[/xref]fragrance to Jehovah.</text>
        <note num="1">Part of the flour and oil and all of the frankincense of the meal offering were God's food ([link]vv. 9[/link], [link]16[/link]). This signifies that a considerable portion of Christ's excellent, perfect, Spirit-filled, and resurrection-saturated living is offered to God as food for His enjoyment. This portion is so satisfying to God that it becomes a memorial. The remainder of the offering, consisting of fine flour and oil but no frankincense, was food for the serving priests ([link]vv. 3[/link], [link]10[/link]).[br][br]Whereas the burnt offering is God's food for His satisfaction ([link]Num. 28:2[/link]), the meal offering is our food for our satisfaction, a portion also being shared with God. Proper worship is a matter of satisfying God with Christ as the burnt offering and of being satisfied with Christ as the meal offering and sharing this satisfaction with God (cf. [link]John 4:24[/link] and note 4).</note>
        <note num="2">All meal offerings were offered by fire on the altar ([link]vv. 4-9[/link]), signifying that Christ in His humanity offered to God as food has gone through the testing fire ([link]Rev. 1:15[/link]). The fire in [link]Lev. 2[/link] signifies the consuming God ([link]Heb. 12:29[/link]), not for judgment but for acceptance. The consuming of the meal offering by fire signifies that God has accepted Christ as His satisfying food.</note>

        <note num="1">The preparing of the meal offering in an oven, in a pan, or in a pot ([link]vv. 4-5[/link], [link]7[/link]) signifies different kinds of sufferings experienced by Christ in His humanity.</note>
        <note num="2">A perforated cake, related to the verb [i]to pierce.[/i] The perforating, or piercing, of the cakes signifies one kind of Christ's sufferings in His humanity ([link]John 19:34[/link], [link]37[/link]; [link]Rev. 1:7[/link]).</note>
        <note num="3">The mingling of fine flour with oil in the meal offering ([link]vv. 4-5[/link]) signifies that Christ's humanity is mingled with the Holy Spirit ([link]Matt. 1:18b[/link]) and His human nature is mingled with God's divine nature, making Him a God-man. Christ is both the complete God and the perfect man, possessing the divine nature and the human nature distinctly, without a third nature being produced. Through the divine mingling Christ's humanity has been uplifted to the highest standard. In His divinity Christ has the divine attributes, and these divine attributes are expressed through, with, and in His human virtues. This is the excellence of Jesus Christ.[br][br]In the meal offering the oil and the fine flour are mingled and cannot be separated. Hence, to eat the fine flour is to eat the oil. The picture in [link]Lev. 2[/link] indicates strongly that the way for us to be nourished with Christ's humanity, and thus to experience His human living, is by the Spirit ([link]John 6:51[/link], [link]57[/link], [link]63[/link]).</note>
        <note num="4">The cakes of fine flour are the largest kind of meal offering and signify the stronger experience of Christ in His humanity by the mature believers. Wafers are hollow and easy to eat. They signify Christ in His humanity experienced and enjoyed by the younger believers. Christ as the meal offering is available as food to God's people of all ages.</note>

        <note num="1">The meal offering could be in the form of flour mingled with oil ([link]vv. 1-2[/link]) or in the form of a cake ([link]v. 4[/link]).

The individual Christ has become the corporate Christ ([link]1 Cor. 12:12[/link]), signified by the cake ([link]1 Cor. 10:17[/link]). This indicates that eventually Christ's life and our individual Christian life issue in a totality &amp;#8212; the church life as a corporate meal offering. Such a life is a life of humanity mingled with the Holy Spirit and which has the Holy Spirit poured upon it, a life with salt and frankincense but with no leaven or honey (see notes [link]1[sup]4[/sup][/link], [link]11[sup]1[/sup][/link], [link]11[sup]2[/sup][/link], and [link]13[sup]1[/sup][/link]).

        <note num="1">Salt functions to season, kill germs, and preserve. In typology salt signifies the death, or the cross, of Christ.

        <note num="1">The peace offering signifies Christ as our peace with God that we may enjoy Him with God and with man in fellowship and joy ([link]Num. 10:10[/link]; [link]Deut. 27:7[/link]). It is fulfilled primarily in our enjoying Christ at the Lord's table in the breaking of bread for the remembrance of Him and in the offering of Christ to the Father for the worship of the Father ([link]Matt. 26:26-30[/link]). The peace offering, which implies fellowship with the Triune God and includes the enjoyment of the Triune God, is illustrated in [link]Luke 15:23-24[/link] by the fattened calf as the peaceful enjoyment between the receiving father (God) and the returned prodigal (a sinner).[br][br]The peace offering is the Old Testament type of the Lord's table. At the Lord's table the believers enjoy Christ as their peace offering for their fellowship with God and with one another. This enjoyment of the peace offering issues from the burnt offering, the meal offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering ([link]v. 5[/link] and note). Our enjoyment of Christ as these four offerings has an issue, a result &amp;#8212; the enjoyment of Christ as our peace offering for us to have fellowship with God and with our fellow believers. See note [link]3[sup]1[/sup][/link].</note>
        <note num="2">The peace offering could be of different animals from the herd or from the flock, and it could be either male or female. The different kinds of peace offerings signify the different conditions of the offerers' enjoyment of Christ.

        <note num="1">Christ as the peace offering is for the fellowship and enjoyment of five parties: God, the serving priest, all the priests (the priesthood), the offerer, and the congregation of cleansed people. The fat and the inward parts of the offering were God's portion ([link]vv. 3-5[/link]); the four kinds of cakes and the right thigh as a heave offering were the portion of the serving priest ([link]7:14[/link], [link]32-34[/link]); the breast as a wave offering was for all the priests ([link]7:30-31[/link], [link]34[/link]); the flesh, the meat, of the offering was the portion of the offerer ([link]7:15-18[/link]); and the remaining flesh of the cattle, under the condition of cleanness, was for all the congregation ([link]7:19-21[/link]). In the New Testament there are no clergy and no laity (see note [link]6[sup]1[/sup] in Rev. 2[/link]). Thus, all the believers in Christ should be the serving priests, the priestly body, the offerers, and the congregation.</note>
        <note num="2">The fat signifies the inward riches of Christ as the abundance of life for God's satisfaction according to His glory, and the inward parts signify the tenderness, smallness, and preciousness of what Christ is in His inward being toward God (cf. [link]Phil. 1:8[/link]; [link]John 7:3-18[/link] and notes) for God's satisfaction, which can be apprehended and appreciated only by God ([link]Matt. 11:27a[/link]). The burning of the fat and the inward parts of the peace offering as an offering by fire to Jehovah ([link]vv. 3-5[/link], [link]9-11[/link], [link]14-16[/link]) signifies that God should be the first Enjoyer, enjoying the first, the best, part of the peace offering.</note>

        <note num="1">The peace offering is based on God's satisfaction in the burnt offering ([link]6:12[/link]). According to the sequence of the offerings presented in [link]1:1-6:7[/link], it is also the issue of the enjoyment of God and man in the meal offering. If we would enjoy Christ as peace in a practical, daily way, we must first take Him as our burnt offering to satisfy God, and then we must feed on Him as the meal offering, enjoying Him as our food.[br][br]According to the sequence of the offerings in [link]6:8-7:38[/link], the peace offering is also based on the sin offering and the trespass offering. When the problem of our sin and trespasses is solved by Christ as the sin offering and trespass offering, and when God and we are satisfied with Christ as the burnt offering and the meal offering, we can offer Christ to God as the peace offering for our mutual enjoyment in peace.

This sin, personified in [link]Rom. 7[/link] (see note [link book="Rom." chapter="7"]8[sup]1[/sup][/link] there), is the evil nature of Satan, even Satan himself, who dwells in our fallen flesh ([link]Rom. 7:17-18a[/link], [link]20[/link], [link]23[/link] and note [link]18[sup]2[/sup][/link]).

        <note num="4">The sin offering signifies Christ as the offering for the sin of God's people. In the Bible [i]sin[/i] refers to the indwelling sin in our nature, whereas [i]sins[/i] refers to the sinful deeds, the fruit of the indwelling sin. Our sin was dealt with by Christ as our sin offering ([link]Lev. 4[/link]; [link]Rom. 8:3[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 5:21[/link]; [link]Heb. 9:26[/link]), and our sins, our trespasses, were borne by Christ as our trespass offering ([link]Lev. 5[/link]; [link]Isa. 53:5a[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 15:3[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 2:24[/link]; [link]Heb. 9:28[/link]). As the Lamb of God, Christ took away sin in its totality &amp;#8212; the inward sin and the outward sins ([link]Isa. 53:10[/link]; [link]John 1:29[/link]). See notes [link]18[sup]1[/sup] in 1 Pet. 3[/link] and [link]7[sup]6[/sup] in 1 John 1[/link].[br][br]Through incarnation the Word, who is God, became flesh, in the likeness of the flesh of sin, i.e., the likeness of a fallen man ([link]John 1:1[/link], [link]14[/link] and note [link]14[sup]2[/sup][/link], par. 1; [link]Rom. 8:3[/link] and note 3). Christ was crucified in the flesh and died in the flesh ([link]1 Pet. 3:18b[/link]). Although Christ was a fallen man only in likeness, when He was on the cross, God counted that likeness as real. Since sin, the old man, Satan, the world, and the ruler of the world are all one with the flesh, when Christ died in the flesh, sin was condemned ([link]Rom. 8:3[/link]), the old man was crucified ([link]Rom. 6:6[/link]), Satan was destroyed ([link]Heb. 2:14[/link]), the world was judged, and the ruler of the world was cast out ([link]John 12:31[/link]). Hence, through Christ's death in the flesh all negative things were dealt with. This is the efficacy of the sin offering.[br][br]The sequence of the five offerings in [link]1:1-6:7[/link] is a picture of the sequence in [link]1 John 1[/link]. The burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering bring us into fellowship with God ([link]1 John 1:3[/link]). Through our fellowship with God, who is light ([link]1 John 1:5[/link]), we discover that we are sinful, that we have sin inwardly and sins outwardly. Hence, after our regeneration we still need to take Christ as our sin offering, as indicated in [link]1 John 1:8[/link], and as our trespass offering, as indicated in [link]1 John 1:9[/link].

(3) Some of the blood was put on the horns of the altar of burnt offering ([link]vv. 25a[/link], [link]30a[/link], [link]34a[/link]), signifying that the blood of Christ is effective for our redemption ([link]Eph. 1:7[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 1:18-19[/link]).

This signifies that the trespass offering for our outward sins, for which even a little fine flour is sufficient, is lighter than the sin offering, which needs a bull, or at least a lamb ([link]4:4[/link], [link]32[/link]).</note>
        <note num="3">The trespass offering here eventually becomes the sin offering ([link]vv. 6-8[/link], [link]11-12[/link]). This reminds us that our sins issue from the sin that dwells in us.

        <note num="1">The laws of the offerings are the ordinances and regulations regarding the offerings, i.e., regarding the enjoyment of Christ as the offerings. Since the reality of the offerings is Christ, the laws of the offerings correspond to the law of the life of Christ, which is the law of the Spirit of life ([link]Rom. 8:2[/link]). These laws indicate that even in the enjoyment of Christ we should not be lawless but should be regulated by the law of life (cf. [link]1 Cor. 9:26-27[/link]; [link]11:17[/link], [link]27-29[/link]; [link]Gal. 6:15-16[/link]; [link]Phil. 3:13-16[/link]).</note>

        <note num="4">The continual burning of the fire on the altar ([link]vv. 9b[/link], [link]12a[/link], [link]13[/link]) signifies that God as the holy fire in the universe ([link]Heb. 12:29[/link]) is always ready to receive (burn) what is offered to Him as food, and that God's desire to accept what is offered to Him never ceases.</note>

        <note num="1">The ashes, the result of the burnt offering, are a sign of God's acceptance of the offering. The priest's putting on linen garments ([link]v. 10[/link]) signifies that fineness, purity, and cleanness are needed in handling the ashes. His putting on other garments to carry the ashes outside the camp ([link]v. 11[/link]) signifies that the handling of the ashes of the burnt offering was done in a stately manner.[br][br]Ashes indicate the result of Christ's death, which brings us to an end, i.e., to ashes ([link]Gal. 2:20a[/link]). The putting of the ashes beside the altar toward the east ([link]1:16[/link]), the side of the sunrise, is an allusion to resurrection. In relation to the burnt offering, the ashes are not the end, for Christ's death brings in resurrection ([link]Rom. 6:3-5[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 4:10-12[/link]; [link]Phil. 3:10-11[/link]). God has a high regard for these ashes, for eventually the ashes will become the New Jerusalem. Our being reduced to ashes brings us into the transformation of the Triune God ([link]Rom. 12:2[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 3:18[/link]). In resurrection we as ashes are transformed to become precious materials &amp;#8212; gold, pearl, and precious stones &amp;#8212; for the building of the New Jerusalem ([link]Rev. 21:18-21[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">The priest's burning wood on the altar every morning signifies the need of the serving one's cooperation with God's desire (see note [link]9[sup]4[/sup][/link]) by adding more fuel to the holy fire to strengthen the burning for the receiving of the burnt offering as God's food (cf.

        <note num="2">See note [link]5[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 3[/link]. The burning of the burnt offering laid a foundation for the sweetness of the peace offering.

However, in our ministering Christ as the sin offering to sinners, we can share in Him ([link]v. 26[/link]). Concerning Christ as the sin offering, both God and the serving priests have a portion, the best portion being for God's enjoyment.</note>

        <note num="1">That the trespass offering (like the meal offering and the sin offering &amp;#8212; [link]6:17[/link], [link]25[/link]) was most holy signifies that Christ as our trespass offering is most holy in dealing with the sins in our conduct. Since the trespass offering refers us to the sin offering, reminding us that sin is in our flesh ([link]1 John 1:7-8[/link]), and to the burnt offering, reminding us that we commit sins because we are not absolute for God (see note [link]7[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 5[/link]), we must not take it in a light way; rather, we must apply Christ as our trespass offering in a holy way.</note>

        <note num="1">The trespass offering being slaughtered where the burnt offering was slaughtered indicates that the trespass offering is based on the burnt offering, and it signifies that Christ is the trespass offering for us based on His being the burnt offering. Christ's being absolute for God is the base for His being both our sin offering ([link]6:25[/link]) and our trespass offering. This reminds us and strengthens us, when we take Christ as our trespass offering, to take Him also as our burnt offering so that in Him, with Him, and through Him we may be absolute for God.</note>

Christ's being these four offerings consummates in peace between God and God's people, and this peace is simply Christ Himself ([link]Eph. 2:14[/link]). Eventually, the enjoyment of Christ as all the offerings, issuing in the peace offering, will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the ultimate peace offering ([i]Jerusalem[/i] means the [i]foundation of peace[/i]), in which we will enjoy the Triune God as peace ([link]Phil. 4:7[/link], [link]9[/link]) for eternity.

This indicates strongly that the anointing of the priesthood is to make God one with us, for the anointing signifies that whatever God is, is doing, and will do are ours (see notes [link book="Exo." chapter="30"]25[sup]1[/sup][/link] and [link]26[sup]1[/sup] in Exo. 30[/link]). In the consecration of the priests the sin offering and the burnt offering immediately followed the anointing ([link]vv. 14-21[/link]). These offerings remind us of who and what we are, and of what we should be and yet are not. See notes [link]14[sup]1[/sup][/link] and [link]18[sup]1[/sup][/link].</note>

Strange fire signifies man's natural enthusiasm, natural affection, natural strength, and natural ability offered to God. Nadab and Abihu did something for God, but they did it in a natural way. Hence, God judged this offering by consuming the two priests ([link]v. 2[/link]).

        <note num="1">The eating of the remainder of the meal offering, as the priests' portion, unleavened in a holy place beside the altar ([link]vv. 12-13[/link]) signifies that after God has enjoyed His portion ([link]2:2[/link], [link]9[/link]), the remaining part of Christ in His humanity as our meal offering is for us, the New Testament priests, to enjoy as our portion without sin (unleavened), in a holy place (in God's presence), and beside the cross (the altar).[br][br]The judgment of God on Aaron's two sons did not terminate God's mercy on His people.

        <note num="1">The priests' partaking of the sin offering to bear the iniquity of the people signifies that we, the New Testament priests, partake of Christ as the believers' sin offering in the sense of participating in Christ's life, the life that bears others' sins, as our life supply that we may be able to bear the problems of God's people. The rich enjoyment of Christ as our sin offering in the church life enables us to minister Christ to the believers as the life that deals with sin, that they may deal with their sins to restore their broken fellowship with God (cf.

        <note num="1">Due to their weakness concerning God's judgment on Nadab and Abihu, Aaron and his sons were not fit to eat the sin offering ([link]vv. 16-17[/link], [link]19-20[/link]). This signifies that if we are weak in accepting God's judgment on the serving ones who are intimate and close to us, we will not be able to partake of Christ as our sin offering in the way of taking His sinless life as our life supply so that we can minister Him to the believers as the life that deals with their sin.[br][br]On the one hand, Aaron and his sons were weak concerning God's judgment; on the other hand, Aaron had a proper consideration, for he and his sons were sorrowful and unhappy, and eating the sin offering under such circumstances would not have been pleasing to the Lord. Aaron's response pleased Moses, who represented God ([link]v. 20[/link]). Aaron and his sons had not followed the divine regulation in a legal way, not because of disobedience but because of a positive consideration of their circumstances. This incident indicates that with respect to keeping the regulations made by God, in God's mercy there is a margin for consideration. What Aaron and his sons did was seemingly against God's regulation, but actually it was something done in wisdom.</note>

        <note num="1">In this chapter the word [i]carcass[/i] (or [i]carcasses[/i]) is used thirteen times, and [i]dead[/i] (or [i]dies[/i]) is used three times. All dead things are unclean ([link]vv. 8[/link], [link]11[/link], [link]24[/link], [link]27[/link], [link]31-40[/link]). Uncleanness, therefore, is synonymous with death. The mentioning of death in relation to diet indicates that our diet, our eating, is a matter of life and death. Life is of the tree of life, and death is of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil ([link]Gen. 2:9[/link], [link]17[/link] and notes). Death is abominable to God. Therefore, in order to live a holy life, we need to abstain from death, i.e., spiritual death.</note>
        <note num="2">According to the Bible, death is more defiling and abominable than sin.

Our sins are forgiven by the Lord immediately after we confess them to Him ([link]1 John 1:9[/link]), but a certain period of time must pass before we can be cleansed from the defilement of spiritual death. A person who touched the carcass of a man was unclean for seven days ([link]Num. 19:11[/link], [link]13[/link]), indicating that in the eyes of God, fallen human beings are the most defiling element (cf.

        <text>Speak to the children of Israel, saying, If a [note]1[/note]woman conceives seed and bears a male child, then she shall be unclean [note]2[/note]seven days; as in the days of her menstruation, she shall be unclean.</text>
        <note num="1">In figure the woman represents all mankind (see note [link]2[sup]1[/sup] in Gen. 3[/link]). Thus, the uncleanness within the woman signifies the uncleanness within all mankind. Since the source is unclean, whatever is born of the source must also be unclean. All mankind was born in uncleanness ([link]Psa. 51:5[/link]) and consequently lives in uncleanness ([link]Eph. 2:1-3[/link]; [link]4:17-19[/link]). In [link]ch. 11[/link] the uncleanness is outside of man, but in this chapter the uncleanness is within man (cf. [link]Matt. 15:17-20[/link]; [link]Rom. 5:19a[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">The uncleanness of the male's birth is for seven days, but that of the female's is for two weeks ([link]vv. 2[/link], [link]5a[/link]), signifying that the male (representing the strong ones) is fully (signified by the seven days) unclean in spite of his strength, and that the female (representing the weak ones &amp;#8212; [link]1 Pet. 3:7[/link]) is doubly (signified by the two weeks) unclean in her weakness.</note>

        <note num="1">[link]Verses 3[/link] and [link book="Lev." chapter="12"]6[/link] reveal the way to deal with the uncleanness in human birth. In this verse the eighth day, the beginning of a new week, refers to Christ's resurrection ([link]Matt. 28:1[/link]; [link]John 20:1[/link]), and circumcision, the cutting off of the flesh, refers to the terminating of the old man in Christ's crucifixion ([link]Rom. 6:6[/link]; [link]Gal. 2:20a[/link]). The circumcising of the male on the eighth day after his birth signifies that the flesh of the unclean person (i.e., the entire person &amp;#8212; [link]Rom. 3:20[/link]) should be cut off, terminated, through the death of Christ that he might be brought into the resurrection of Christ not only to be cleansed but also to have a new beginning of life ([link]Col. 2:11-12[/link]).

        <note num="1">After the birth of a male, the woman was to remain in the blood of her purifying thirty-three days, and after the birth of a female, sixty-six days ([link]v. 5b[/link]). In the case of the male the total number of days for purifying was forty (seven plus thirty-three), and in the case of the female the total number of days was eighty (fourteen plus sixty-six). In the Bible the number forty denotes a period of testing ([link]Deut. 9:9[/link]; [link]1 Kings 19:8[/link]). Because the birth of a human being is altogether unclean, it must be tested for cleanness. The uncleanness of a female's birth should be doubly tested for cleanness.</note>
        <note num="2">During the test of the uncleanness, the woman's not being allowed to touch any sanctified thing or to enter into the sanctuary signifies that man is not allowed to touch the things concerning God or go into the presence of God until his uncleanness is dealt with (see notes [link]3[sup]1[/sup][/link] and [link]6[sup]1[/sup][/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">After the completion of the test of the uncleanness, a burnt offering and a sin offering were to be offered ([link]vv. 6-8[/link]), signifying that after our uncleanness by birth is fully dealt with through Christ's death and resurrection ([link]v. 3[/link] and note), we need Christ further to be our burnt offering for our not being for God and to be our sin offering for our sin ([link]Heb. 10:5-7[/link]), that Christ may be our life and our living that is absolute for God and that He may deal with the sin that is still in our flesh as we live on earth ([link]1 John 1:7-2:2[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">Leprosy signifies the serious sin issuing from within man, such as willful sin, presumptuous sin, and opposing God with determination. As seen in the cases of Miriam ([link]Num. 12:1-10[/link]), Gehazi ([link]2 Kings 5:20-27[/link]), and Uzziah ([link]2 Chron. 26:16-21[/link]), leprosy issues from rebellion against God's authority, against God's deputy authority, against God's regulation, and against God's economy. In the biblical sense, sin is rebellion ([link]1 John 3:4[/link] and note 2). Thus, leprosy signifies sin. The first case of sin in the Bible was Satan's rebellion against God ([link]Ezek. 28:13-18[/link]; [link]Isa. 14:12-15[/link]). Hence, sin as rebellion was invented, inaugurated, by the rebellious archangel Lucifer. Eventually, this sin, this leprosy, entered into mankind through Adam ([link]Rom. 5:12[/link], [link]19a[/link]; [link]7:20[/link]), and having entered into man, it issues from within man as many kinds of sins, i.e., many manifestations of rebellion. Hence, a leper represents the fallen descendants of Adam, all of whom are lepers. See note [link]2[sup]1[/sup] in Matt. 8[/link].[br][br]As signs of leprosy, a swelling, eruption, or a bright spot on the skin of one's flesh signifies man's outward expressions in unruliness, in friction with others, and in pride and self-exaltation.</note>

        <note num="2">Since wool is soft, woolen garments signify one's conduct, contact with people, etc., in meekness. Linen is pure, plain, and simple; thus, linen garments signify one's conduct, contact with people, etc., in plainness. Clothing made from skins ([link]v. 48[/link]) is warm; hence, garments made of skins signify one's conduct, contact with people, etc., in warmness. As signified by these three kinds of garments, our conduct should be in meekness, in plainness, and in warmness, with no sign of leprosy &amp;#8212; the expression of sin and rebellion.</note>

        <note num="1">The warp in the weave of a garment goes from top to bottom, and the woof, from left to right. Thus, the warp signifies our outward conduct toward God, our relationship with God, and the woof signifies our outward conduct toward others. Our conduct in our daily walk is an interweaving that involves both God and man. We need to be proper with both God and man; i.e., in our garments, our conduct, there should be no leprosy, rebellion, either in the warp or in the woof, either toward God or toward man.</note>

        <note num="1">The greenish or reddish infection in the garment signifies the abnormal and strange change in one's living and conduct. The infection spreading in the garment, becoming a malignant leprosy ([link]v. 51[/link]) of the kind that spreads by eating the flesh, signifies sin that is spreading within a person by devouring the person, becoming worse and worse in its malignancy.</note>

        <note num="1">Burning the garment in fire signifies eliminating the sinful and filthy living and conduct by dealing with it strongly by the cross of Christ ([link]Gal. 5:19-24[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">A leprous decay is very serious; it signifies the corroding sin that is becoming worse and deeper, having no change in appearance through repentance and confession. This is the kind of sin that can take over a person, devouring and swallowing him up.</note>

        <note num="1">The tearing out of the faded infected part of a garment signifies the eliminating, through a thorough dealing, of the suspected weakness in one's living and conduct. The reappearing of the infection in the garment ([link]v. 57[/link]) signifies that one's weakness, after being dealt with and eliminated, has come out again.</note>

        <note num="1">The two living clean birds are types of Christ, who is clean, without any defilement, and full of the life that is able to fly above the earth. The birds here signify that Christ came from the heavens and that He belongs to the heavens and transcends the earth. The bird that was killed ([link]v. 5[/link]) signifies the crucified Christ, who died for us that our filthiness might be taken away ([link]1 Pet. 2:24[/link]). The second bird, which was let go into the open field ([link]vv. 6-7[/link]), signifies the resurrected Christ, who rose from the dead for us that we might be delivered from our weakness by the power, strength, and energy of His resurrection life &amp;#8212; the divine, eternal, uncreated life of God ([link]Rom. 8:2[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">Cedar wood (cf. [link]1 Kings 4:33[/link]) signifies the honorable and uplifted humanity of Jesus, which enables Him to be our Savior. Hyssop, being one of the smallest of the plants, signifies here that the Lord Jesus was willing to become lowly in His "becoming in the likeness of men" ([link]Phil. 2:7[/link]) that He might be near to man and become man's Savior (cf. [link]Matt. 8:2-3[/link]). Scarlet, a dark red color, signifies the shedding of blood ([link]Josh. 2:18[/link] and note) and also implies kingship ([link]Matt. 27:28-29[/link]). All of this signifies that in order to cleanse us from our leprosy, the Lord lowered Himself to become a man of high standard but of low status that He might do the will of God and shed His blood on the cross for our redemption, thereby being glorified in His resurrection and becoming the honorable and high King ([link]Phil. 2:5-11[/link]).</note>
        <note num="3">The one who had been healed from leprosy ([link]v. 3[/link]) still needed to seek to be cleansed before God, signifying that the one who is sick of the sin of leprosy, although he has been healed by the divine life within, still needs to have his shortcomings and defilement dealt with before God that he might be cleansed. Our seeking to be cleansed is our cooperation with God's grace and love.</note>

The bird being killed in an earthen vessel over living water signifies that through His death in His humanity the Lord Jesus offered Himself to God through the eternal and living Spirit who was within Him ([link]Heb. 9:14[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">The things recorded in [link]vv. 6-7[/link] signify that the Lord's perfect redemption not only causes man to be cleansed objectively in his position but also causes man to experience subjectively, in the Holy Spirit, the Lord's suffering in the shedding of His blood in His honorable, uplifted, and yet lowly humanity and to experience His death, resurrection, ascension, and glorification ([link]Eph. 2:5-6[/link]; [link]Phil. 3:10[/link], [link]21[/link]; [link]Col. 3:1-4[/link]).

        <note num="1">The sprinkling of the blood of the slain bird on the leper who was to be cleansed signifies that the blood shed by Christ was sprinkled on us, the sinners ([link]1 Pet. 1:2[/link]), and this sprinkling connects us to Christ, the Redeemer (cf. note [link]22[sup]2[/sup] in Exo. 12[/link]). The sprinkling of the blood seven times signifies the completeness of the cleansing of the Lord's blood ([link]1 John 1:7[/link], [link]9[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">Christ's ascension is signified by the living bird's soaring in the air.

        <note num="1">The leper's washing his clothes, shaving off all his hair, and bathing himself in water signifies that in addition to experiencing Christ's death, resurrection, and ascension in his union with Christ through His redemption ([link]vv. 5-7[/link]), a sinner who is to be cleansed needs to bear the responsibility himself to deal with and cut off all that is of his old living and natural life.[br][br]For the significance of washing one's clothes, shaving off one's hair, and bathing oneself in water, see note [link]34[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 13[/link], note [link book="Lev." chapter="14"]9[sup]1[/sup][/link] in this chapter, and note [link]5[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 15[/link], respectively.</note>
        <note num="2">The clean leper coming into the camp but dwelling outside his tent for seven days signifies that a sinner who is to be cleansed is still unable to recover the fellowship with the brothers; he needs to be watchful, to wait, and to be dealt with further.

        <note num="1">The hair of the head signifies man's glory in self-display; the beard, man's self-assumed honor; the eyebrows, man's excellencies, merits, and virtues issuing from his natural birth; and all the hair of the body, man's natural strength and ability. The shaving off of all the hair and the bathing in water equal getting rid of the self with all its glory, honor, excellencies, merits, virtues, strength, and ability through the "razor" of the cross.

        <note num="2">The leper's shaving of his entire body, washing his clothes, and bathing his flesh a second time after waiting and watching seven days signifies that a sinner who is to be cleansed needs to bear the responsibility for dealing with every part of his natural life and daily walk.

        <note num="1">As revealed in [link]vv. 10-32[/link], in addition to his cleansing ([link]v. 9[/link]), the leper who was to be cleansed still needed to solve the problem of his sin and sins before God by offering the trespass offering, the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the meal offering to make expiation for himself before God ([link]vv. 18-20[/link]). This signifies that a sinner who is to be cleansed, even though he has been cleansed, still needs to solve the problem of his sin and sins before God through Christ as the reality of the offerings to make propitiation for himself before God. Expiation (see note [link]1[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 16[/link]) was needed in addition to healing ([link]v. 3[/link]) and cleansing ([link]vv. 4-9[/link]) in order to appease God and bring the leper (the sinner) back into fellowship with God.</note>

        <note num="1">The house typifies the church as our real home, and the leprosy in the house signifies sins and evils in the church.

Because we were born in uncleanness ([link]12:1-8[/link]; [link]Psa. 51:5[/link]) and are a totality of uncleanness, whatever issues out of our natural being as a discharge is both unclean and contagious, causing everyone, everything, and every place to be defiled.</note>

        <note num="2">[i]Until the evening[/i] signifies coming to an end through death.

        <text>[note]1[/note]Then Jehovah spoke to Moses after the [xref]a[/xref]death of the two sons of Aaron, when they drew near before Jehovah and died.</text>
        <note num="1">Because of the negative situation of God's people, as portrayed in [link]chs. 11-15[/link], according to God's concept and in His divine economy there is the need of redemption. Because the Old Testament time was not the time for redemption to take place, a type, a shadow, of the coming redemption was needed. This shadow is the expiation in this chapter. The expiation accomplished through the animal sacrifices in the Old Testament is a type pointing to the redemption accomplished by Christ in the New Testament.[br][br]The root of the Hebrew word translated [i]expiation[/i] means [i]to cover.[/i] The noun form of this word is rendered [i]expiation cover[/i] in [link]v. 2[/link] and in [link]Exo. 25:17[/link]. The root of the Greek word used in the Septuagint and in the New Testament, translated [i]propitiation[/i] in [link]Rom. 3:25[/link]; [link]Heb. 2:17[/link]; and [link]1 John 2:2[/link] and [link]4:10[/link], means [i]to appease[/i] (the situation between two parties). On the Day of Expiation the blood of the sin offering was brought into the Holy of Holies and sprinkled on the expiation cover, the lid of the Ark ([link]vv. 14-15[/link]), which covered the Ten Commandments within the Ark ([link]Exo. 25:16[/link]), signifying that the sin of the ones coming to contact God had been covered but not yet removed (see note [link]3[sup]3[/sup] in Heb. 1[/link]). In this way the situation of fallen man in relation to God was appeased but was not fully settled, until Christ came to accomplish redemption by offering Himself as the propitiatory sacrifice to take away man's sin ([link]Heb. 9:12[/link]; [link]2:17[/link]; [link]1 John 2:2[/link]; [link]4:10[/link]; [link]John 1:29[/link]). See notes [link book="Rom." chapter="3"]25[sup]2[/sup][/link] and [link]25[sup]3[/sup] in Rom. 3[/link], [link]17[sup]4[/sup] in Heb. 2[/link], [link]12[sup]2[/sup] in Heb. 9[/link], and [link]2[sup]1[/sup] in 1 John 2[/link].</note>

This signifies that Christ as the sin offering for God's people, on the one hand, deals with our sin before God and, on the other hand, sends sin, through the efficacy of the cross, back to Satan, from whom sin came into man. Through the cross the Lord Jesus has the position and qualification with the power, strength, and authority to take sin away from the redeemed ones ([link]John 1:29[/link]; [link]Heb. 9:26[/link]) and send it back to its source, Satan, who will bear it in the lake of fire forever ([link]Rev. 20:10[/link]).</note>

This is one of the results produced through the redemptive, blood-shedding death (signified by the coals of fire from the altar and the finely ground incense of spices) of the Lord Jesus on the cross.[br][br]The incense was burned with the fire from the altar in the outer court, signifying that Christ's being burned as the incense for our acceptance before God depends on His death on the cross for our sins.

        <note num="1">The blood of that which dies of itself signifies the blood of one who sacrifices himself for the good of others, which blood cannot redeem us from our sins. Only the blood of Jesus Christ, whom God bruised on the cross ([link]Isa. 53:10[/link]), can cleanse us from all sin ([link]1 John 1:7[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">The blood of that which is torn by beasts signifies the blood of one who is martyred by wild people, who are like beasts, which blood also is unable to redeem us from our sins. Only the blood of Jesus Christ, whom God judged on the cross ([link]Isa. 53:8[/link]), is able to wash us from our sins ([link]Rev. 1:5[/link]).</note>
        <note num="3">This signifies that the one who takes any blood other than the blood of the Lord Jesus should deal with his former behavior and with what he was in the past concerning religion and should purge himself. Otherwise, he will be condemned.[br][br]To eat different bloods is equivalent to forming different religions based on beliefs in different persons. The one blood ordained by God is the blood of Jesus Christ shed on the cross ([link]John 6:53-55[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 10:16a[/link], [link]21a[/link]), and the one belief is the belief in the Christ who died on the cross for us (see note [link]5[sup]3[/sup] in Rom. 1[/link]).</note>
        <note num="4">Being unclean until the evening signifies that the one who takes any blood, i.e., any belief, other than the blood of the Lord Jesus is unclean until the matter is cleared up and brought to a complete ending.</note>

        <note num="1">To make our head bald indicates that we do not subject ourselves to God's headship, that we do not accept God's authority over us (cf. [link]1 Cor. 11:5[/link]), and to shave off the corners of the beard or to make cuttings in the flesh indicates that we are engaging in human labor to have some change in our body, which was designed and created by God.

To put on the priestly garments signifies that we should live a life that befits our priestly service. Not letting the hair go loose signifies that we submit to God's authority and are not disobedient, unrestrained, or disorderly in our actions. Not tearing one's clothes (signifying one's behavior &amp;#8212; [link]Rev. 19:8[/link]) signifies that we should not make ourselves bankrupt in morality.</note>

A defect in the eye signifies the sight in spiritual things that is not perfect because of the lack of a full view of Christ (cf. [link]Acts 18:24-28[/link]). Eczema signifies some expression that is abnormal in life, making oneself feel uneasy and making others feel bad, because of the lack of the Spirit of Christ (cf. [link]Phil. 1:19-20[/link]). Scales signify something that causes oneself to be uncomfortable and in its appearance bothers others, because of a lack in living Christ (cf. [link]Phil. 1:21a[/link]).

        <note num="1">The feasts are for rest and enjoyment, both of which are types of Christ as our rest and enjoyment. The mentioning of the feasts in this book, a book of God's priesthood for God's service in the fellowship of God, indicates that our priestly service to God issues in Christ as the rest and enjoyment that we have with God and with one another. God ordained the feasts that His people might rest with Him and be joyful with Him, that they might enjoy with Him and with one another all that He has provided for His redeemed people. The rest and enjoyment were not individual but corporate.</note>
        <note num="2">The feasts appointed by Jehovah were holy convocations, special assemblies of God's people called for a special and particular purpose. These signify the gathering of the believers as the church (see note [link]22[sup]4[/sup] in Eph. 1[/link]) to have a corporate rest and enjoyment of Christ before God, with God, and with one another.</note>

This signifies the resurrection of Christ in its sevenfold fullness reaching the realm of the complete fullness, bearing the full responsibility, signified by the number fifty (composed of ten times five, ten signifying fullness and five, responsibility), for the testimony of resurrection.[br][br]On the day of Pentecost in the New Testament, the consummation of the Triune God &amp;#8212; the all-inclusive, life-giving, compound Spirit of the processed Triune God, who is the totality of the Triune God &amp;#8212; was poured out upon the one hundred twenty disciples as representatives of the Body of Christ. As a result of such an outpouring of the economical Spirit of God, the Body of Christ came into existence as the increase, the enlargement, of the unlimited, individual Christ, making Him the universal, corporate Christ ([link]1 Cor. 12:12-13[/link]), the mingling of the processed and consummated Triune God with His chosen and redeemed people, which will ultimately consummate in the New Jerusalem.</note>

        <note num="1">The offering of a new meal offering to Jehovah ([link]v. 16[/link]) of two loaves of bread baked with leaven as firstfruits to Jehovah signifies that Christ at the stage of the firstfruits (the unleavened fine flour) has become the church as the Body of Christ in two sections at the stage of Pentecost (the two loaves &amp;#8212; [link]1 Cor. 10:17[/link]), offered to God as the new meal offering for God's satisfaction. One of the sections is composed of the Jewish believers ([link]Acts 2:1-4[/link]) and the other, of the Gentile believers ([link]Acts 10:34-48[/link]). Both sections had sins (signified by the leaven) within them (cf. [link]Acts 5:1-11[/link]; [link]6:1[/link]).[br][br]That the two loaves also were firstfruits to Jehovah indicates that not only Christ but also the church are the firstfruits. Christ the firstfruits, as the fine flour, was the firstfruits on the day of resurrection ([link]1 Cor. 15:20[/link]; [link]John 20:17[/link]). Eventually, this fine flour became the two loaves on the day of Pentecost. In type, this indicates that Christ has become the church, that the church is the enlargement of Christ ([link]John 3:29-30[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 12:12[/link]; [link]Col. 3:10-11[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">The presenting of the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the drink offering with the bread signifies that the church on the day of Pentecost was a corporate man offered to God as a burnt offering to live absolutely for God, with a living as a meal offering mixed with leaven &amp;#8212; sins &amp;#8212; and as a drink offering (pouring out its life for God by being martyred &amp;#8212; [link]Phil. 2:17[/link]; [link]2 Tim. 4:6[/link]) to be an offering by fire accepted by God by being consumed for the satisfaction of both God and man.</note>

This feast was on the first day of the seventh month, the beginning of the second half of the year, signifying the second half of God's redemption, which is to be accomplished on Israel, the first half having been accomplished on the church. The interval between the Feast of Pentecost and the Feast of the Blowing of Trumpets signifies the church age, the age of mystery, which lasts from the day of Pentecost, when the church came into being, until the Lord's coming back, when God will call the scattered Jews to come back to the land of their fathers. God's calling His people back together from their dispersion will cause them to have a holy convocation, signifying their returning to God (repentance) and becoming a corporate people. This will be a memorial and a rest to God's gathered people, in which they will be able to offer Christ to God as food for the satisfaction of both God and man ([link]v. 25[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">Spiritually, the blowing of the trumpets signifies the proclaiming of the gospel to call sinners to repentance and salvation (cf. note [link]9[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 25[/link]), and the expiation signifies Christ's redemption (see note [link]1[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 16[/link]). The Feast of Expiation closely followed the Feast of the Blowing of Trumpets, which involves Israel's repentance and return to God. This signifies that the day of man's redemption follows the trumpeting of the gospel and man's repentance as a reaction to it. The Feast of Expiation has a double application. Spiritually, this feast has been applied to the New Testament believers, and literally it will be applied in the future to the Jews.</note>
        <note num="2">The people's afflicting their souls and bringing an offering by fire to Jehovah ([link]vv. 27c[/link], [link]29[/link]) signify their mourning, repenting, and feeling sorrowful for sin, and offering Christ as food to God for the satisfaction of both God and man.

        <note num="1">The seven feasts in this chapter are in two groups, with four in the first group and three in the second. The four feasts in the first group all took place in the first half of the year, signifying the time when Christ died, resurrected, and ascended to pour out the Holy Spirit. The three feasts in the second group took place in the seventh month of the year, signifying the time of Christ's second coming. According to their dispensational fulfillment, the first four have taken place already, and the last three will take place in the future. The Feast of the Passover was fulfilled on the day of Christ's death ([link]Matt. 26:2[/link], [link]17-19[/link], [link]26-28[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 5:7[/link]). The Feast of Unleavened Bread is being fulfilled in the church age ([link]1 Cor. 5:7-8[/link]). The Feast of Firstfruits was fulfilled on the day of Christ's resurrection ([link]1 Cor. 15:20[/link]), when the members of Christ were produced for the formation of the church ([link]1 Pet. 1:3[/link]; [link]Eph. 2:6[/link]). The Feast of Pentecost was fulfilled fifty days after Christ's resurrection, on the day of the pouring out of the Holy Spirit ([link]Acts 2:1-4[/link]; cf. [link]Acts 1:3[/link]), when the resurrected and ascended Christ as the consummated, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit poured Himself out on His members to form the church. The Feast of the Blowing of Trumpets will be fulfilled at Christ's second coming ([link]Matt. 24:31[/link]). The Feast of Expiation will be fulfilled on the day of Israel's return to God, after they have been gathered back to their fathers' land ([link]Rom. 11:26-27[/link]; [link]Zech. 12:10-14[/link]). The Feast of Tabernacles will be fulfilled in the coming millennium for a thousand years ([link]Rev. 20:4-6[/link]) as a conclusion of all the ages of God's old creation, for the coming of the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem as their center ([link]Rev. 21:1-2[/link]).</note>

Moreover, the first and last years of this fifty-year period were eighth years, and in between there were six eighth years, making a total of eight eighth years.

        <note num="1">The sounding of the ram's horn in the forty-ninth year on the Day of Expiation signifies that the jubilee is based on the expiation for sin (see [link]ch. 16[/link]), that the full liberty might be proclaimed to all the people ([link]v. 10[/link]).

        <note num="1">That the jubilee was in the fiftieth year ([link]vv. 10-11[/link]) signifies that the full responsibility (typified by the number fifty) to meet all the requirements of God has been fulfilled so that man does not need to bear any responsibility. Fifty years also signifies the entire course of fallen human life. Thus, the year of jubilee, the fiftieth year, signifies the conclusion of our fallen human life.[br][br]The year of jubilee is the acceptable year of the Lord prophesied in [link]Isa. 61:1-2[/link] and fulfilled by the Lord's coming in [link]Luke 4:16-22[/link]. In the Old Testament type the jubilee lasted for one year, but in the fulfillment it refers to the entire New Testament age, the age of grace, as the time when God accepts the returned captives of sin ([link]Isa. 49:8[/link]; [link]Luke 15:17-24[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 6:2[/link]) and when those oppressed under the bondage of sin enjoy the release of God's salvation ([link]Rom. 7:14-8:2[/link]). The believers' enjoyment of the jubilee in the age of grace, i.e., their enjoyment of Christ as God's grace to them, will issue in the full enjoyment of the jubilee in the millennium and in the fullest enjoyment in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth.</note>
        <note num="2">In the year of jubilee everyone who had sold his possession, his allotted portion of the good land, was returned to it without paying anything to redeem it ([link]vv. 10[/link], [link]13[/link], [link]28[/link]), and everyone who had sold himself into slavery regained his freedom and returned to his family ([link]vv. 39-41[/link]). Returning to one's possession and being freed and returning to one's family signify that in the New Testament jubilee the believers have returned to God as their lost divine possession, have been released from all bondage, and have returned to the church as their divine family.[br][br]Each family of the Israelites was allotted a portion of the good land. After the children of Israel received their portions of the land, some became poor and sold their allotment ([link]v. 25a[/link]), thus losing their possession, their inheritance. Others became so poor that they even sold themselves into slavery ([link]v. 39a[/link]), thus losing their freedom and becoming separated from their families. The good land of Canaan typifies the Triune God embodied in Christ ([link]Col. 2:9[/link]) and realized as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit ([link]1 Cor. 15:45[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 3:17[/link]; [link]Gal. 3:14[/link]) as the allotted portion of the saints (see note [link]7[sup]1[/sup] in Deut. 8[/link]). When God created man, He intended to give Himself in Christ to man as man's possession, man's inheritance ([link]Gen. 2:9[/link]; [link]13:12-15[/link]; [link]Psa. 16:5[/link]; [link]90:1[/link]). However, man became fallen, and in the fall man lost God as his possession ([link]Gen. 3:24[/link]; [link]4:16[/link]; [link]Eph. 2:12[/link]) and sold himself into slavery under sin, Satan, and the world ([link]John 8:34[/link]; [link]Rom. 7:14b[/link]; [link]Gal. 4:8[/link]; [link]Titus 3:3[/link]; [link]1 John 5:19b[/link]). God's New Testament salvation, accomplished by God's grace based on His redemption in Christ ([link]Rom. 3:24[/link]; [link]5:1-2[/link]; [link]Eph. 2:8[/link]), brings fallen man back to God as His divine possession ([link]Acts 26:18[/link]; [link]Gal. 3:14[/link]; [link]Eph. 1:14[/link]; [link]Col. 1:12[/link]; [link]Luke 15:12-24[/link]), releases man from slavery under sin, Satan, and the world ([link]John 8:32[/link]; [link]Rom. 6:6[/link], [link]14[/link]; [link]8:2[/link]; [link]Heb. 2:14-15[/link]; [link]John 12:31[/link]), and restores man to his divine family, the household of God ([link]Gal. 6:10[/link]; [link]Eph. 2:19[/link]), that he may enjoy fellowship in God's grace ([link]2 Cor. 13:14[/link]).[br][br]In the present age the whole race of Israel has become poor and has lost the land of Canaan. At the Lord's second coming, the millennium will be a jubilee to them, in which they will regain ownership of their God-allotted portion ([link]Isa. 61:1-2[/link] and notes).</note>

[link]Rom. 11[/link]). We may become defeated and may even be disciplined during the millennium, but our spiritual ownership of the divine possession cannot be lost permanently (cf. [link]1 Cor. 3:15[/link]). After the millennium, the disciplined believers will be restored to the ownership of their divine possession, especially in the new heaven and the new earth, to enjoy the blessing of the New Jerusalem. It is of the grace of God that we will be restored to our divine possession for eternity.</note>

        <note num="1">[link]Verses 24-28[/link] speak of the redemption of the land that has been sold. The redeeming of the land by the nearest relative ([link]v. 25[/link]) signifies that in Adam we became poor and sold our possession, and the Lord Jesus, our nearest relative, has come as our Redeemer to redeem for us what we sold (cf. [link]Ruth 3-4[/link]). The redeeming of the land by the person who sold it, he not having anyone to redeem it for him ([link]vv. 26-27[/link]), signifies that the children of Israel, not recognizing the Lord Jesus as their nearest relative ([link]John 1:11[/link]), have put themselves in the position of having to bear the responsibility for their redemption until they become able to redeem themselves. However, to this day they are still unable to do it, and actually they will never be able to do it. When the Lord Jesus comes back, they will recognize Him as their relative ([link]Zech. 12:10[/link]), and then they will be redeemed by Him. Not having sufficient means to redeem the possession and waiting for the year of jubilee, when the one who sold the land would return to his possession ([link]v. 28[/link]), signifies that we were unable to redeem what we had lost until the coming of the New Testament jubilee, in which all that we had lost is released to us to be our possession.

The limiting of the time of the redemption of such houses to one year after the sale ([link]vv. 29-30[/link]) signifies that if a believer has lost the enjoyment of the church life, it can be restored only within a short limit of God's grace, as indicated by the one year. If the lost enjoyment of the church life is not restored in the church age, the age of grace, it will still be lost in the millennium, the age of the kingdom. This is according to the principle of taking away from him who has not ([link]Matt. 25:29[/link]). Ultimately, in the New Jerusalem the enjoyment of the Body life of Christ will be restored to the defeated believers after they have been disciplined during the millennium. See note [link]23[sup]1[/sup][/link].[br][br]Losing the enjoyment of the church life is more serious than losing the enjoyment of Christ. Because the Lord is gracious, it is easy for us to recover our enjoyment of Him. However, it is more difficult and requires a longer time to recover the lost church life.

        <note num="1">The adding of one-fifth of the valuation to redeem the house signifies that we should not take advantage of our devotion related to the church life, that we may keep the enjoyment of the church life. Otherwise, we will be churchless persons.</note>

        <verse num="16">
        <text>And if a man consecrates to Jehovah part of a [note]1[/note]field of his possession, then your valuation shall be according to the [note]2[/note]seed needed for it: a homer of barley seed at fifty shekels of silver.</text>
        <note num="1">Spiritually, the devoting of a field, a part of the land, is related to the enjoyment of Christ as the rich land (see note [link]7[sup]1[/sup] in Deut. 8[/link]). The more we devote ourselves and our possessions to God, the more we will enjoy Christ. All our devotions consummate in the enjoyment of Christ.</note>
        <note num="2">This signifies that our devotion related to the enjoyment of Christ as the rich land should be valued according to the seed of the divine life required for our spiritual increase. In the type, the more seed required, the higher was the value of the land. Seed is for multiplication, for life increase ([link]John 12:24[/link]). If our devotion related to the enjoyment of Christ will afford a greater prospect for the increase of the church, this devotion will be more valuable.</note>

        <text>If he consecrates his field from the [note]1[/note]year of jubilee, according to your valuation it shall stand.</text>
        <note num="1">The longer the time until the jubilee, the greater was the value of the devoted land ([link]vv. 17-18[/link]). This signifies that our devotion related to the enjoyment of Christ should be valued also according to the measure of God's grace from the jubilee. The amount of seed needed for the devoted land, and hence the value of the land ([link]v. 16[/link]), depended on the number of years before the jubilee. If we devote ourselves to the Lord early in life, we will have more years to bring sinners to the Lord and thus to contribute to the increase of the church. The greater the increase we bring in, the greater the grace we will enjoy (cf. [link]John 15:2[/link], [link]6[/link]).</note>
