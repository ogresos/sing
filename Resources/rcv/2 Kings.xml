        <note num="1">Elijah is a type of the Old Testament age with the Old Testament economy, and Elisha is a type of the New Testament age with the New Testament economy. The age was changed by passing through four places &amp;#8212; Gilgal, Bethel, Jericho, and the river Jordan ([link]vv. 1-8[/link]). Gilgal was a place where God's people were circumcised to deal with their flesh ([link]Josh. 5:2-9[/link]); Bethel is the place to give up the world and turn to God absolutely, taking God as everything ([link]Gen. 12:8[/link]); Jericho, the first city that Joshua and the people of Israel had to defeat when they entered into the good land, signifies the head of God's enemy, Satan ([link]Josh. 6:1-27[/link]); and the river Jordan, where the New Testament baptism began, signifies death ([link]Matt. 3:5-6[/link] and note [link]6[sup]2[/sup][/link]). To cross the river Jordan, Elijah struck the water with his mantle, which typifies the outpoured Spirit, the Spirit of power ([link]v. 8[/link]). The Spirit of power dealt with the river of death so that the way was opened for Elijah and Elisha to cross over. All this signifies that in order for the age to be changed from the Old Testament to the New Testament in our experience, we must deal with our flesh ([link]Gal. 5:24[/link]), give up the world and turn to God ([link]1 John 2:15-17[/link]), defeat Satan ([link]Rev. 12:11[/link]), and pass through death ([link]Rom. 6:3-4[/link]; [link]Gal. 2:20[/link]).</note>

Furthermore, we must "tear our clothes into two pieces" ([link]v. 12[/link]), indicating that we no longer treasure what we are or what we can do (cf. [link]Matt. 16:24[/link]). Through all these steps we enter into a new age, the age of the New Testament, where Christ is doing gracious things.</note>

Elisha behaved in a way which was very similar to that of the Lord Jesus in the Gospels, doing many gracious and sweet things ([link]vv. 19-22[/link]; [link]4:1-6:7[/link]).[br/][br/]Elijah was a type of John the Baptist in convicting people unto death ([link]Luke 1:17[/link]; [link]Matt. 11:11[/link], [link]14[/link]; [link]3:1-2[/link], [link]6-11a[/link]). John the Baptist, who came before Christ, ushered in Christ, as typified by Elijah's ushering in Elisha, who was a type of Christ ([link]Luke 4:27[/link]) in doing miracles of grace in life. Elisha was a type in the Old Testament who represented God's New Testament economy in grace. Grace is God doing everything for us by giving Himself to us as our enjoyment ([link]John 1:1[/link], [link]14-17[/link]). This grace issues in the divine life, which is rich and high, even unto making us co-kings with Christ ([link]Rom. 5:17[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">The link between the Old Testament books of history and the New Testament is God's economy, which is for Christ and His Body, the church. This link is shown in the kings' history, which includes the prophets, who, as God's overcomers, prophesied concerning God's New Testament economy. Again and again the prophets came in either to help the kings or to deal with them, as illustrated here by Isaiah's helping Hezekiah (cf. [link]2 Sam. 7:1-17[/link]; [link]12:1-15a[/link]; [link]1 Kings 18[/link]; [link]2 Kings 3[/link]). The prophecies in [link]Isaiah 7:14[/link] and [link]9:6[/link] indicate that God would put humanity upon Himself, mingling His divinity with humanity, and the prophecy in [link]Isaiah 53[/link] unveils that in His humanity the God who had become man would be man's Redeemer who would be slain for man's sin. Thus, in typology the history of the kings is linked through the prophecies of the prophets to God's becoming a man to redeem man back to Himself that He might make His redeemed people the same as God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead so that God can consummate His economy in the Body of Christ as the enlargement of Christ. This Body of Christ will consummate in the New Jerusalem as God's universal, corporate expression and enlargement for eternity.</note>

        <note num="1">There were altogether forty-one kings in the history of Israel. The first three, Saul, David, and Solomon, reigned over the entire people of Israel. Nineteen kings, from Rehoboam to Zedekiah (not counting the illegitimate reign of Athaliah &amp;#8212; [link]11:1-16[/link]), reigned over Judah in the south, and nineteen, from Jeroboam to Hoshea, reigned over Israel in the north. Among these forty-one kings, nine, including David, were comparatively good in the eyes of God. Thirty, including Saul, were evil in the sight of God. Two, Solomon and Jehu, were partly good and partly evil.[br/][br/]The root of the evil of the evil kings, like that of the evil of the people of Israel, was their forsaking the very God as the fountain of living waters and their turning away to the pagan idols as broken cisterns that hold no water ([link]Jer. 2:13[/link]). These two evils drowned them in the death waters of idolatry, of the indulgence of lusts, and of injustice in shedding the blood of the innocent. Their evils offended their God to such an extent that He would not turn His anger from them but cast them off, first into the hands of the Assyrians ([link]17:6[/link]) and then into the hands of the Babylonians ([link]24:10-25:21[/link]), who destroyed and burned the holy temple and the holy city, carried away into captivity the holy people to a pagan land of idol worship, and desolated the Holy Land for seventy years ([link]Jer. 25:11[/link]). Thus, they, as God's elect, lost the enjoyment of the God-given good land and, instead of remaining the citizens of God's kingdom in the Holy Land, became captives in a heathen land.[br/][br/]All the kings should have had a thorough realization that they were to be kings who ruled not for their own interest and prosperity but for God's eternal economy, that God could have a nation on the earth to keep the land of Immanuel ([link]Isa. 8:8[/link]) for Christ's reign and a people for a genealogy to bring Christ to the earth. For this purpose the kings had to be Nazarites, who take God as their Head, their authority, who submit themselves to Him as His servants, and who abandon all the pleasures (wines) of the world (see note [link]3[sup]1[/sup] in Num. 6[/link]). But all the kings failed God in this, including David, the best one among them ([link]2 Sam. 11[/link]). Thus, they did not fulfill God's purpose for His economy. Rather, they lost their reign in God's kingdom, which is the top portion of the enjoyment of the good land (the all-inclusive Christ &amp;#8212; see note [link]7[sup]1[/sup] in Deut. 8[/link]).[br/][br/]The tragic result of such a pitiful history of the kings among God's chosen and blessed elect should be a serious warning to us, God's elect in the New Testament age, and should indicate to us how sober we should be to take heed to the particular points of each case. Just to be one who is according to God's heart, like David, and just to be partly right and good in the eyes of God, like many honest Christians today, do not qualify us to partake of Christ in full and to enjoy all the rights in Him that we may adequately become the church as the Body of Christ and as the kingdom of God and of Christ. Conformity to Christ's death by the power of His resurrection ([link]Phil. 3:10[/link]) is required of us, the New Testament overcomers, that we may die to ourselves, our natural man, and live to God in resurrection. A life of living Christ, magnifying Christ, and moving and acting with Christ by the bountiful supply of the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit, doing everything in and according to the Spirit ([link]Phil. 1:19-21a[/link]; [link]Gal. 5:16[/link], [link]25[/link]; [link]Rom. 8:4[/link]), is indispensable for us, God's New Testament seekers, to be winners in the racecourse of the divine life that we may fully enjoy Christ as the God-given good land in the church age and be gloriously rewarded to partake of Christ, in the fullest sense, in the kingdom age ([link]1 Cor. 9:24-27[/link]; [link]Phil. 3:12-14[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">The children of Israel forsook God and went after idols, so God dispersed them into all the nations; yet, in His eternal love ([link]Jer. 31:3[/link]) He would bring them back to their fathers' land. Although Jerusalem and the temple were destroyed and God's people were carried away into captivity, God still carried out the return from captivity (see [link]Ezra[/link]) in order to preserve the fourteen generations of Christ's genealogy "from the deportation to Babylon until the Christ" ([link]Matt. 1:17[/link]). God was gracious to David, Solomon, and the nation of Israel in order to keep the line of Christ's genealogy that Christ might come into humanity and in order to maintain a people to possess the land of Immanuel ([link]Isa. 8:8[/link]), so that Christ could come to establish His kingdom on the earth. Through the return from captivity the good land was recovered, and God carried out His intention to bring Himself in His Trinity into humanity and to set up His spiritual kingdom.[br/][br/]Because of Israel's failure and God's judgment, the line of the genealogy of Christ became very thin, but in God's sovereignty that line was never broken. The royal Davidic family was destroyed, but God kept David's lineage so that He could come to be a man through incarnation (see notes [link]16[sup]2[/sup] in Matt. 1[/link] and [link]23[sup]3[/sup] in Matt. 2[/link]). This brought God to humanity and into humanity, and it changed the age in the whole universe, including the heavens.</note>
