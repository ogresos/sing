        <text>The [note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]Song of Songs, which is Solomon's.</text>
        <note num="1">Song of Songs is a history of love in an excellent marriage, a story of the love between the wise King Solomon, the writer of this book, and the Shulammite ([link]6:13[/link]), a girl of the countryside. As such, this book is a marvelous and vivid portrait, in poetic form, of the bridal love between Christ as the Bridegroom and His lovers as His bride ([link]John 3:29-30[/link]; [link]Rev. 19:7[/link]) in their mutual enjoyment in the mingling of His divine attributes with the human virtues of His lovers. Song of Songs stresses not the Body of Christ corporately but the believer in Christ individually, unveiling the progressive experience of an individual believer's loving fellowship with Christ in four stages, as shown in points I through IV of the outline of this book. The correspondence between the progression in the poem and the progression in the experience of Christ's lovers is the intrinsic revelation of the holy Word of the omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent God. The stages of such a progression should be landmarks to us in the course of our pursuing of Christ for His and our mutual satisfaction.[br/][br/]In the romance between the great King Solomon and the girl from the countryside (cf. [link]vv. 5-8[/link]), because the two did not match each other, the king became a "country man" in order to go to her village to court her, to gain her love. On the one hand, he made himself the same as the country girl; on the other hand, he made the country girl a queen. This is a type of the story of God's romance with man. God as the Husband is divine, and the wife He desires to marry is human; the two do not match each other. To fulfill His heart's desire God became a lowly man with humanity in incarnation, and He contacted man by the way of a romance. Then in His resurrection He uplifted His humanity into His divinity in the divine power according to the Spirit of holiness, and He was designated the Son of God in His humanity ([link]Rom. 1:3-4[/link] and notes). Today He as the universal Bridegroom is the God-man, having both divinity and humanity. In order to make His bride, His wife, the same as He is, He regenerates His human elect, putting His divinity into their humanity and uplifting their humanity to the standard of divinity ([link]1 Pet. 1:3[/link], [link]23[/link]; [link]John 3:6[/link]). After regenerating them, He then transforms His loving seekers gradually in their soul, and ultimately He transfigures them in their body, until in their entire being they are the same as He is in life, in nature, in image, and in function, but not in His Godhead ([link]Rom. 12:2[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 3:18[/link]; [link]Phil. 3:21[/link]; [link]1 John 3:2[/link]). The romance in Song of Songs portrays the process through which the seeker of Christ passes in order to become the Shulammite, a duplication of Solomon and a figure of the New Jerusalem. See note [link]13[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 6[/link].</note>

        <text>Let him [xref]a[/xref]kiss me with the [note]1[/note]kisses of his [xref]b[/xref]mouth! / For your [xref]c[/xref]love is better than wine.</text>
        <note num="1">The kisses of the mouth are the most intimate kisses. This yearning to be kissed by Christ is a response to Christ's cheering love, which is better than wine ([link]v. 2b[/link]), and to His charming name (equivalent to His person), which is like ointment (the all-inclusive, compound, life-giving Spirit as the realization of Christ's person &amp;#8212; [link]1 Cor. 15:45[/link]; [link]Exo. 30:23-25[/link] and note [link]25[sup]1[/sup][/link]) poured forth with the pleasant fragrance of the anointing oils ([link]v. 3a[/link]). No one can resist Christ's cheering love and His charming person (cf. [link]Matt. 4:18-20[/link]).[br/][br/]According to [link]vv. 2-3[/link], the lover of Christ has obtained a part of Christ's love, but now she yearns for something more intimate. This indicates that the very Christ in whom we believe is personal and affectionate toward us, and that every believer's relationship with Christ must be personal and affectionate ([link]Mark 16:7[/link] and note; [link]John 13:23[/link]; [link]20:1-17[/link]; [link]Gal. 2:20b[/link]). After believing in Christ to receive Him as the divine life ([link]John 1:4[/link], [link]12[/link]), we need to love Christ in a personal and affectionate way that we may pursue Him and enjoy Him as our satisfaction ([link]1 Cor. 2:9[/link] and note 3; [link]1 Tim. 1:14[/link] and note 2).</note>

        <note num="1">In her pursuing of Christ for satisfaction, the lover of Christ asks Him to draw her that she and her companions ("we") may run after Him. For the accomplishing of His eternal economy, God created man in His own image so that man may express Him ([link]Gen. 1:26[/link]). He also created man with a spirit so that man may receive Him and contain Him ([link]Gen. 2:7[/link]; [link]Zech. 12:1[/link]), and with a heart that seeks God Himself so that God can be man's satisfaction ([link]Eccl. 3:11[/link]). Although man fell away from God, and sin through Satan came in to frustrate man from receiving God for his satisfaction, the desire for God, the seeking for God, still remains in man's heart. This book tells us the unique way to be properly satisfied with God &amp;#8212; to pursue and gain Christ ([link]Phil. 3:7-14[/link]), who as the very embodiment and reality of God ([link]Col. 2:9[/link]; [link]John 1:18[/link]) came to earth that man might receive Him for satisfaction. Cf. [link]Eccl. 1:2[/link] and note 2.</note>
        <note num="2">In her pursuing of Christ the seeker is brought by Him into her regenerated spirit as the Holiest of all (his chambers) to have fellowship with Him ([link]2 Cor. 13:14[/link]; [link]Phil. 2:1[/link]). Our regenerated spirit ([link]John 3:6[/link]) as Christ's dwelling place, which is mingled with and indwelt by Christ as the life-dispensing Spirit ([link]1 Cor. 6:17[/link]; [link]2 Tim. 4:22[/link]), becomes His inner chambers, His practical Holy of Holies ([link]Heb. 4:16[/link]; [link]10:19[/link]), for our participation in and enjoyment of Him as the consummated Triune God.[br/][br/]Through His death and resurrection Christ, as the last Adam, a man in the flesh, became the life-giving Spirit ([link]1 Cor. 15:45[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 3:17[/link]). As the all-inclusive consummated Spirit He visits us in our spirit privately, coming to us in a spiritual way, not in a physical way.</note>
        <note num="3">The fellowship of Christ and His lover in her mingled spirit is in the joy of Christ's lover with her companions ("we"), in their extolling of His unrivaled love.</note>

        <note num="1">The seeker realizes that she has been kept away from Christ's presence and separated from Christ's flock &amp;#8212; the church in the proper sense according to the apostles' teaching ([link]John 10:16[/link]; [link]Acts 20:28[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 5:2[/link]) &amp;#8212; and that she needs Christ's feeding and rest with satisfaction.</note>

        <note num="1">In her fellowship with her Beloved, the Beloved tells her to go forth from the place where she is kept away from the proper church life and to follow Him on the footsteps of the church (flock) and pasture her spiritual children (young goats) at the local churches (the shepherds' tents), where He pastures His church. To follow on the footsteps of the flock is to follow the church, to follow the footsteps of all the faithful seekers of Christ throughout the centuries. As we follow the church, we are led into Christ's presence, and we bring all the younger ones (young goats) to the church as well. The church is the place where Christ's presence is and where He pastures, shepherds and feeds, His saints ([link]John 10:11[/link], [link]16[/link]; [link]Acts 20:28[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 5:2-4[/link]).[br/][br/]The Lord's lover has been seeking Him for her own satisfaction, but the Lord's concern is for God's satisfaction realized by the accomplishing of His eternal economy. God's economy is to save sinners in order to gain the proper local churches, so that the essence of these churches can become the organic Body of Christ, which consummates the New Jerusalem as the consummation of God's economy. Hence, in His answer to His lover, Christ instructs her to enter into the church life and also charges her to take care of her spiritual children, the members of the Body of Christ.</note>

But in the church life she is transformed ([link]Rom. 12:2[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 3:18[/link]) into a person who lives not by her natural life in relying on her natural strength but by the divine life in trusting in God (a lily &amp;#8212; [link]2:1-2[/link]; [link]Matt. 6:28[/link]) and looking to Him with a single eye (eyes like doves &amp;#8212; [link]v. 15b[/link]; [link]Matt. 10:16[/link]).</note>

The transforming Spirit and the lover's companions adorn her with the constitution of the life of God (plaits of gold) by the redeeming work of Christ (studs of silver).

In the proper church life the lover's companions, the perfected believers, coordinate with the transforming Spirit to perfect the lover by ministering the Triune God to her for her transformation by the Triune God's attributes being wrought into her to become her virtues. This is for the building up of the church as the organic Body of Christ to consummate the New Jerusalem (cf. [link]1 Cor. 3:12[/link]; [link]Rev. 21:18-21[/link]) for the accomplishing of God's eternal economy.</note>

        <note num="1">In the first stage of her progressive experience of Christ, the lover of Christ pursues Him ([link]1:2-4a[/link]), receives help in the fellowship in the inner chambers ([link]1:4b-6a[/link]), and enters into the church life ([link]1:6b-8[/link]), where she experiences transformation ([link]1:9-16a[/link]; [link]2:1-3a[/link]) and enters into the rest and enjoyment of Christ for her full satisfaction ([link]1:16b-17[/link]; [link]2:3b-7[/link]). These attainments result in a situation in which she overcares for her spiritual condition before Christ, being too concerned about whether or not she remains in the perfection she has attained. This causes her to fall into introspection, which becomes a seclusion as a wall that keeps her away from the presence of Christ. Every spiritual person who reaches a situation of satisfaction in Christ eventually falls into introspection, not only examining the self but also analyzing it (cf. [link]Heb. 12:2[/link]). If such a condition persists, the self becomes stronger and eventually becomes the center of everything in the lover's life.</note>

        <note num="1">Here Christ, considering her His simple lover (My dove), wants to see His lover's lovely countenance and hear her sweet voice in her oneness, union, with the cross, signified here by the clefts of the rock and the covert of the precipice. This is Christ's call for His lover to be in oneness with the cross (cf. [link]Luke 9:23[/link]). Only the cross of Christ can deliver her from the situation caused by introspection.[br/][br/]Christ wants His seeker to remain in the cross, in a crucified condition, continually ([link]Gal. 2:20a[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 15:31[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 4:10-11[/link]). However, to remain in the cross is a difficult matter, like entering into the clefts of the rock and the covert of the precipice high in the mountains by a rugged road. In order to empower and encourage His lover to rise up and come away from her low situation in her introspection of the self, Christ empowers her by showing her the power of His resurrection ([link]vv. 8-9a[/link]), and He encourages her by the flourishing riches of His resurrection ([link]vv. 11-13[/link]). It is by the power of Christ's resurrection, not by our natural life, that we, the lovers of Christ, determine to take the cross by denying our self ([link]Matt. 16:24[/link]). It is also by the power of Christ's resurrection that we are enabled to be conformed to His death by being one with His cross ([link]Phil. 3:10[/link]). The reality of resurrection is the pneumatic Christ ([link]John 11:25[/link]), who as the consummated Spirit indwells and is mingled with our regenerated spirit ([link]1 Cor. 6:17[/link] and notes). It is in such a mingled spirit that we participate in and experience the resurrection of Christ, which enables us to be one with the cross to be delivered from the self and to be transformed into a new man in God's new creation for the fulfillment of God's economy in the building up of the organic Body of Christ.</note>

Christ's espousals began from the time of incarnation, when incarnation as His mother crowned Him with His humanity, and continue through the church age, an age of warfare ([link]vv. 7-8[/link]), in which all His believers are espoused to Him as virgins ([link]2 Cor. 11:2[/link]). After the church age, in the kingdom age Christ's regenerated and transformed wife, composed of the overcoming believers, becomes a palanquin to Him for His triumphant celebration ([link]vv. 9-10[/link]). The celebration of Christ's victory is His thousand-year wedding day ([link]Rev. 19:7-8[/link]). His marriage life after His wedding will be the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth for eternity ([link]Rev. 21:9-10[/link]).[br/][br/]The union of the bed with its sleeper ([link]vv. 7-8[/link]), the union of the palanquin with its rider ([link]vv. 9-10[/link]), and the union of the bride with her bridegroom ([link]v. 11[/link]) all signify the complete union of the lover with Christ, which has made her God's new creation in Christ's resurrection ([link]2 Cor. 5:17[/link]). The bed in the night, the palanquin in the day, and the marriage life in the ages to come all refer to the one lover of Christ &amp;#8212; the Shulammite ([link]6:13[/link] and note 1). Eventually, the New Jerusalem will be a corporate Shulammite, which will include all God's chosen and redeemed people ([link]Rev. 21:9-10[/link], [link]12[/link], [link]14[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">Lit., breathes. After the lover of Christ has experienced Christ in His sweet death and His fragrant resurrection ([link]2:14-3:5[/link]), in her deeper pursuit she determines to stay in the sweet death of Christ (the mountain of myrrh) and His fragrant resurrection (the hill of frankincense) until her Beloved comes back (the day dawns and the shadows flee away &amp;#8212; cf. [link]2 Pet. 1:19[/link]). Here it seems that the lover does not care whether her Beloved is with her or not, as long as she remains on the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense. However, it is not possible to experience Christ's death and resurrection as something separate and apart from Christ. The death, resurrection, ascension, and Spirit of Christ are actually Christ Himself ([link]Rom. 6:3[/link]; [link]John 11:25[/link]; [link]Eph. 2:6[/link]; [link]Rom. 8:9-10[/link]). If we remain in Christ, who is the Spirit in our spirit ([link]Rom. 8:16[/link]), and have Christ with us, we will be in His death, His resurrection, and His ascension. This is to experience Christ, to enjoy Christ.[br/][br/]God in His economy does not want us to experience something of Christ. Instead, He determined that we enjoy Christ Himself in many aspects. Death, resurrection, ascension, and the Spirit are the four conditions in which Christ is enjoyed by us. To die with Christ is to enjoy Christ in His death. He is always in His sweet death for our enjoyment ([link]Gal. 2:20a[/link]). To be resurrected with Christ is to enjoy the resurrected, life-giving Christ ([link]John 12:24[/link]). To live in ascension is to enjoy Christ in the condition of ascension ([link]Col. 3:1-3[/link]). If we enjoy Christ in ascension, we also enjoy Him in resurrection as God's new creation. Ascension, God's new creation, and resurrection are one. Christ is not only in the conditions of His death, resurrection, and ascension but also in the condition of the life-giving Spirit. He is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit of Jesus Christ to us ([link]1 Cor. 15:45[/link]; [link]Phil. 1:19[/link]). Where the Spirit is, Christ is, and it is in this Spirit that we enjoy Christ.</note>

        <note num="1">Here Christ expresses His appreciation of His lover to prepare her to receive His call to live with Him in His ascension as His new creation in resurrection, instead of remaining on the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense ([link]v. 6[/link]). The new creation is only that which is in ascension in resurrection. Anyone who is in Christ and in His resurrection is a new creation ([link]2 Cor. 5:17[/link]). The matters of resurrection and the new creation are closely related to Christ's ascension. Actually, Christ's resurrection and ascension are one (cf. [link]Eph. 2:5-6[/link]). If we are in His resurrection, we are also in His ascension.</note>

        <text>[i]Come[/i] with me from [note]1[/note]Lebanon, [i]my[/i] [xref]a[/xref]bride; / With me from [note]2[/note]Lebanon come. / Look from the top of [note]3[/note]Amana, / From the top of [note]4[/note]Senir and [note]5[/note][xref]b[/xref]Hermon, / From the [note]6[/note]lions' dens, / From the [note]6[/note]leopards' mountains.</text>
        <note num="1">Here Christ asks His lover as His bride to look with Him from His ascension (Lebanon), the highest place of the truth (Amana) and of Christ's victory in His fighting (Senir and Hermon), and from the heavenly places of the enemies (the lions' dens and the leopards' mountains). Christ calls His lover to live with Him in His ascension, as He had called her to remain in His cross ([link]2:14[/link]). When the lover is living in ascension, she and Christ are living in one condition, the condition of ascension, to be a couple. Christ is divine and human, and His transformed lover is human and divine. They are the same in life and nature, perfectly matching one another.</note>
        <note num="2">Lebanon, a high mountain, signifies ascension as the peak of resurrection ([link]2 Kings 19:23[/link]; see note [link]3[sup]1[/sup] in John 6[/link]). See note [link]7[sup]1[/sup][/link].</note>
        <note num="3">Meaning [i]truth.[/i] The truth refers to the reality of the consummated Triune God, the all-inclusive Christ with His complete redemption, and the all-inclusive, compound, life-giving, sevenfold intensified Spirit. These realities are the three of the Triune God. Cf. note [link]6[sup]6[/sup] in 1 John 1[/link].</note>
        <note num="4">Meaning [i]soft armor[/i]. That the armor is soft, not hard, signifies that the enemy, Satan, has been defeated, the war is over, and the victory has been gained ([link]Heb. 2:14[/link]; [link]Col. 2:15[/link]). In Christ's ascension we do not need to fight, for the enemy has already been defeated. We wear soft armor to enjoy our victory in Christ.</note>
        <note num="5">Meaning [i]destruction[/i]. In Christ's ascension there are the positive peaks of truth (Amana), victory (Senir), and the destruction of the enemy.</note>
        <note num="6">The lions' dens and the leopards' mountains signify the heavenlies, where Satan and his subordinates (the lions and the leopards) are. The victory has been gained, but Satan and his evil forces are still there, in the heavenlies ([link]Eph. 3:10[/link] and note 1). Christ calls His lover to look from this, indicating that we must have our living in ascension, far above the evil powers (see note [link]12[sup]4[/sup] in Eph. 6[/link]). Here we fight with Satan and his power of darkness by being empowered in the Lord and in the might of His strength, by putting on the whole armor of God, by standing against the stratagems of the devil, by receiving the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, the word of God, and by praying always in the spirit for the building up of the Body of Christ and the spreading of the gospel ([link]Eph. 6:12-20[/link]). This is the reality of living in the ascension of Christ.</note>

Here the garden is enclosed, and there is a spring shut up, a fountain sealed, for Christ's private enjoyment, indicating that in experiencing Christ we, the seeking believers, must have something private, hidden, shut up, and sealed that is for Christ alone. The spring is the Spirit of life and is seen in [link]Rev. 22:1[/link] as the river of water of life. The fountain is the source of the spring, which is God's throne.</note>

        <note num="1">Tirzah, a capital city of the kings of Israel and the place of the kings' palace ([link]1 Kings 14:17[/link]; [link]15:21[/link]; [link]16:23[/link]), is mentioned here in a positive sense to signify the sanctuary of God, the dwelling place of God as the King. The holy city Jerusalem was the capital of Judah and the safeguard of God's dwelling place, the temple, on earth. Hence, these two cities signify God's sanctuary, God's dwelling place, with God's holy city surrounding it to be its safeguard. Here the Beloved's praising His lover, saying that she is as beautiful as the heavenly sanctuary (Tirzah) and as lovely as the heavenly Jerusalem, indicates that through her living in Christ's ascension as the new creation in resurrection, the lover of Christ becomes mature in the riches of the life of Christ so that she becomes not only a garden to Christ ([link]4:12-5:1[/link]; [link]6:2[/link]) but also the building of God (cf. [link]Gen. 2:8-12[/link], [link]18-24[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 3:9-12[/link]), the sanctuary of God and its safeguard. It indicates further that she lives in the Holy of Holies, the inner chamber of the heavenly sanctuary, within the veil, experiencing the ascension of Christ through the cross after her experience of His resurrection. To become a garden to Christ is to be flourishing in the element of Christ's life with its unsearchable riches; to become the sanctuary of God is to be built up (related to the building up of the Body of Christ) in the growth in the life of Christ with its unsearchable riches unto maturity ([link]Eph. 4:12-16[/link]). In the Old Testament the building of God is typified by Tirzah and Jerusalem; in the New Testament this building is the organic Body of Christ. Ultimately, the building up of the organic Body of Christ, which is also Christ's wife ([link]Eph. 5:25-32[/link]), will consummate the New Jerusalem, the holy city as the consummation of the Holy of Holies, the mutual dwelling of God and His redeemed in eternity ([link]Rev. 21:2-3[/link], [link]16[/link], [link]22[/link]).[br/][br/]Although the sanctuary of God is in the heavens, it is divided into two sections &amp;#8212; the outer Holy Place and the inner Holy of Holies, where God Himself dwells &amp;#8212; by the veil, which signifies our flesh ([link]Heb. 9:1-5[/link], [link]12[/link], [link]24[/link]; [link]10:19-20[/link]). In relation to Christ, the veil in the sanctuary of God was split at the time of Christ's crucifixion ([link]Matt. 27:51[/link]), but in relation to the believers, it still remains so that God may use it to perfect His seeking ones and so that they may be one with God by dwelling in Him as the Holy of Holies (see [link]Rev. 21:22[/link] and notes). The apostle Paul became mature in the life of Christ, living in the ascension of Christ, yet God still allowed him to have a thorn in his flesh through a messenger of Satan to keep him from being exceedingly lifted up ([link]2 Cor. 12:7[/link]). According to God's economy, no matter how mature and spiritual we may become, as long as we are living on earth, i.e., as long as our body has not yet been transfigured ([link]Rom. 8:23[/link]; [link]Phil. 3:21[/link]), we still have the flesh, which is the veil. Hence, there is still the need of the Lord's ultimate calling of us to live within the veil through a stronger experience of the cross in dealing with our flesh after we experience Christ's resurrection as the new creation of God. We need to learn to pass through the veil by experiencing the dealing of the cross every day that we may live within the veil, in the Holy of Holies. It is here that all the seekers of Christ who live in the Holy of Holies, in the consummated Triune God, enjoy to the fullest extent the hidden Christ in His hidden life supply (signified by the manna in the golden pot &amp;#8212; [link]Exo. 16:32-34[/link]; [link]Rev. 2:17a[/link]), in the resurrection life (signified by the budding rod &amp;#8212; [link]Num. 17:1-11[/link]), and in the inner law of life (signified by the tablets of the covenant &amp;#8212; [link]Exo. 25:16[/link]; [link]31:18[/link]; [link]Deut. 10:1-5[/link]; [link]Jer. 31:33[/link]) hidden in the Ark within the Holy of Holies ([link]Heb. 9:4[/link]). This is the highest stage in the experience of the lover of Christ as presented in this book.</note>
        <note num="2">This praise of the Beloved's indicates that her becoming the heavenly sanctuary and the heavenly Jerusalem is due to her victory over the enemies. Only by being an overcomer can we live within the veil.[br/][br/]When the overcoming lover of Christ becomes one with God to be God's dwelling place, in the eyes of God she is as beautiful as Tirzah and as lovely as Jerusalem. However, to the enemy she is as terrible as an army with banners. Banners indicate a readiness to fight and also are a sign that the victory is won. A terrible army signifies that the overcomers of the Lord terrify God's enemy, Satan, and become terrible in the eyes of God's people. This army fights the battle for God's kingdom in the degradation of God's people to become the overcomers who answer the Lord's call ([link]Rev. 2:7[/link], [link]11[/link], [link]17[/link], [link]26[/link]; [link]3:5[/link], [link]12[/link], [link]21[/link]). Eventually, the overcomers will be a bride collectively to marry Christ ([link]Rev. 19:7-9[/link]). After their wedding, this bride will become an army to fight alongside Christ, her Husband, to defeat Antichrist with all his followers ([link]Rev. 19:11-21[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">Through her living in the ascension of Christ and further living within the veil, experiencing the cross of Christ more strongly, the lover of Christ is transformed into the heavenly bodies, indicated here by the moon and the sun.

        <note num="1">The feminine form of [i]Solomon,[/i] derived from the root meaning [i]peace.[/i] The use of this name here indicates that at this point she has become Solomon's duplication, counterpart, the same as Solomon in life, nature, expression, and function, as Eve was to Adam ([link]Gen. 2:20-23[/link] and notes). This signifies that in the maturity of Christ's life the lover of Christ becomes the reproduction of Christ, the same as He is in life, nature, expression, and function (but not in the Godhead) to match Him for their marriage ([link]2 Cor. 3:18[/link]; [link]Rom. 8:29[/link]).[br/][br/]This couple's becoming one indicates the New Jerusalem. In the New Jerusalem the redeeming God (signified by Solomon) and all His redeemed (signified by the Shulammite) become one &amp;#8212; a universal couple ([link]Rev. 21:9-10[/link]; [link]22:17[/link]). The New Jerusalem is a mingling of divinity and humanity to express the processed and consummated Triune God in human virtues.</note>
        <note num="2">Heb. [i]mahanaim[/i] (cf. [link]Gen. 32:2[/link]). Here the Shulammite is likened to two armies, or camps, dancing in celebration of their victory. After he met the angels of God, Jacob divided his wives, children, and the rest of his possessions into two camps, or "two armies" ([link]Gen. 32:1-10[/link]). The spiritual significance of the two camps as two armies is that we are more than conquerors ([link]Rom. 8:37[/link]). It also signifies a strong testimony. There being two armies indicates that the country girl, the Shulammite, was not alone. An army indicates the principle of the Body of Christ ([link]Rom. 12:5[/link]).[br/][br/]God does not want those who are strong in themselves. He wants only the feeble ones, the weaker ones, the women and children (cf. [link]1 Cor. 1:26-28[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 12:9-10[/link]). They can become His armies because the fighting is not in their hands but in His. God needs a people who are one with Him, a people who are submissive to Him, signified by the plaited hair ([link]1:11[/link]), and obedient to Him with a flexible will, signified by the neck with strings of jewels ([link]1:10[/link]). Those who are counted worthy to be overcomers will be the weaker ones who depend on the Lord (cf. [link]Rev. 3:8[/link]; [link]Rom. 9:16[/link]; [link]Gal. 2:20[/link]).</note>

He wishes that her feeding of others would be rich (breasts like clusters of the vine), that her intuition (nose) would be fragrant for nourishing others in life (apples), and that her foretaste would be of the power of the age to come (best wine &amp;#8212; [link]v. 9a[/link]; [link]John 2:10[/link]; [link]Matt. 26:29[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">Christ's lover wants to carry out with her Beloved the work that is for the entire world (fields) by sojourning from one place to another (lodging in the villages). This indicates that she is not sectarian in carrying out the Lord's work. She keeps the work open, so that others can come to sojourn there and she can go to sojourn elsewhere. This is to keep one work in one Body.[br/][br/]To share in the work of the Lord is not to work for the Lord but to work together with the Lord ([link]1 Cor. 3:9a[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 6:1a[/link]). To work with the Lord, we need the maturity in life, we need to be one with the Lord, and our work must be for His Body. The Shulammite works as Solomon's counterpart, taking care of all the vineyards ([link]8:11[/link]), the churches and the believers on the whole earth. This indicates that our work should be for the Body, not just one city. We must have a work that is for the entire world. This is what Paul did by establishing local churches and then working to bring them into the full realization of the Body of Christ.</note>

Realizing all the troubles that come from her flesh, the lover wishes that Christ could be her brother in the flesh who was born of grace (her mother &amp;#8212; [link]Gal. 4:26[/link]), i.e., that He would be the same as she is in the flesh. This indicates poetically her groaning for her flesh.

        <note num="1">Since the lover has matured in life in pursuing Christ and in the ultimate consummation of her experience of Christ, before her rapture she with Christ is concerned for the younger lovers of Christ, whose faith and love (breasts &amp;#8212; [link]1 Tim. 1:14[/link]) have not yet matured. She is concerned about how to perfect the younger ones to mature in life for the building up of the Body of Christ and to love Christ until they are betrothed to Him in love for the constituting of the bride of Christ ([link]2 Cor. 11:2[/link]; [link]Gal. 4:19[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">If the younger one (see note [link]8[sup]1[/sup][/link]) is a wall for separation from the world (sanctification), Christ's mature lover with her Beloved will perfect that one by building upon her a battlement based on the redemption of Christ (silver). If the younger one is a door as an entry for people to enter into Christ, the lover of Christ with her Beloved will perfect that one by building an enclosure around her with Christ's heavenly and glorified humanity ([link]Matt. 26:64[/link]; [link]Acts 3:13[/link]) and His heavenly human life (cedar &amp;#8212; [link]Phil. 2:7-8[/link]).

        <text>Solomon had a vineyard at [note]1[/note]Baal-hamon: / He let out the [xref]a[/xref]vineyard to keepers; / Each was to bring a thousand [i]shekels[/i] of silver for its fruit.</text>
        <note num="1">Meaning [i]Lord of all.[/i] Solomon as a great lord who possessed many vineyards rented the vineyards to keepers in order to gain produce. The vineyard keepers would pay Solomon one thousand shekels. Each vineyard keeper had helpers to keep the fruit, and he had to pay them two hundred shekels ([link]v. 12[/link]). In the work of Christ, Christ is the Lord of all the works (vineyards). We, as Christ's lovers, are vineyard keepers, who participate in one part of Christ's work. According to the Lord's requirement, we should pay Him the one thousand shekels, i.e., pay Him what He requires. In our work with the Lord we do not have "helpers"; hence, we as the vineyard keepers are able to keep the fruit ourselves. Thus, instead of giving the two hundred shekels to others, we give it to ourselves. This is the same as the Lord giving us two hundred shekels as a reward. [link]Verses 11-12[/link] show that our work with the Lord must exceed what He requires. The Lord requires not only what He has delivered to us but what He has given to us with interest ([link]Matt. 25:26-27[/link]). With this interest as the basis, the Lord will reward us when He comes back. This reward will be given not according to the Lord's grace but according to His righteousness.[br/][br/]Christ as our Beloved is the Lord of all, possessing all things ([link]Acts 10:36[/link]), and we as His lovers share in all His possessions ([link]1 Cor. 3:21-22[/link]) freely in the grace of Christ ([link]Rom. 3:24[/link]), which is the issue of the love of God ([link]2 Cor. 13:14[/link]). Yet we as His lovers still should give Him as our Beloved what we should give, not as a duty but as a matter of love (cf. [link]Gal. 5:13[/link]). Christ as our Beloved, joining Himself to us as one, still likes to give us a reward of righteousness ([link]2 Tim. 4:8[/link]). This implies that Christ as our Beloved gives us a reward for the residue of our labor as an incentive to our faithfulness in our labor for Him in love (cf. [link]Matt. 25:20-23[/link]); hence, it is a reward of righteousness.</note>

Such a prayer portrays the union and communion between Christ as the Bridegroom and His lovers as the bride in their bridal love, in the way that the prayer of John, a lover of Christ, as the concluding word of the Holy Scriptures, reveals God's eternal economy concerning Christ and the church in His divine love ([link]Rev. 22:20[/link]).</note>
