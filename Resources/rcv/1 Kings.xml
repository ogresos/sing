        <verse num="1">
        <text>[note]1[/note]Now when King [note]2[/note]David was old [i]and[/i] advanced in [note]3[/note]years, they covered him with clothing, but he could not get warm.</text>
        <note num="1">The striking point of the historical books concerning Israel is that they portray in detail, in the way of typology, how to experience Christ as the good land given to us by God as our portion (see note [link]7[sup]1[/sup] in Deut. 8[/link]). First, the book of Joshua shows the way to gain, to take possession of, and to keep the good land. Then the books of Judges, Ruth, and 1 and 2 Samuel show how certain persons remained in the good land and enjoyed the good land after they took possession of it. First and 2 Kings are needed to show how more persons remained in and enjoyed the good land.[br/][br/]The kings, as representatives of Israel, enjoyed the good land on the highest level. They are types of the New Testament believers, who were saved by God to enjoy Christ as their good land up to the level of the kingship ([link]Rom. 5:17[/link]; [link]2 Tim. 2:12[/link]; [link]Rev. 20:4[/link], [link]6[/link]; [link]22:5b[/link]). The picture portrayed in the two books of Kings depicts in detail the character, intention, preferences, habits, morality, and actions of all the kings who reigned over Israel after David the king. Such a picture indicates that what we are, what we desire, what we intend to do, and how we behave have very much to do with our remaining in Christ and participating in all His unsearchable riches for our enjoyment. This picture concerning Israel ends with a tragedy of all the kings who were put into the blessed situation of the kingship and who were not faithful to God and did not take good care of their inheritance: they lost the good land and were carried away as captives to the idol-worshipping world. This should be a solemn alarm and warning to us in our relationship with Christ. If we are wrong in any of the matters mentioned above, we will suffer the loss of Christ as our enjoyment. See note [link]25[sup]2[/sup] in Lev. 18[/link].[br/][br/]The central thought of the books of Kings is God's governmental dealing, in God's economy, with the devastating and ruining of the divine kingship on the earth by the kings, and the tragic issue of the just dealing of God, i.e., the loss of the Holy Land, which was the base of God's kingdom on the earth, and the capture of the holy people, who maintained the line of Christ's genealogy. The devastating of the land and the carrying away of the holy people almost ended the two lines needed for the bringing of Christ into humanity (see note [link]16[sup]2[/sup] in Matt. 1[/link]). Nevertheless, according to the genealogy in [link]Matt. 1:1-17[/link], these two lines were continued even through the captivity. In His sovereignty God carried out the return from captivity in order to recover the good land and preserve fourteen generations of Christ's genealogy ([link]Matt. 1:17c[/link]). Thus God still carried out His intention to bring Himself in His Trinity into humanity and to set up His spiritual kingdom.</note>
        <note num="2">The record of the first two chapters of 1 Kings could be considered a conclusion of the history of David recorded in 1 and 2 Samuel.</note>
        <note num="3">David not only became old but also was fading away. David's life had a good beginning, like the bright sun rising, and his life with his career became like the sun shining at noon. However, his indulgence in lust ([link]2 Sam. 11[/link]) spoiled his career and caused his bright life to fade like the sunset in the evening. In David's old age there was nothing bright, excellent, or splendid.</note>

        <note num="1">The first two kings, David and Solomon, are important types of Christ in two aspects. First, David typifies Christ in the aspect of His suffering on earth before His resurrection. From the time of His birth, Christ suffered. His life began in a manger in the lowest estate and ended in His being crucified on the cross. The manger and the cross were the two ends of His suffering life. David also suffered from his youth; yet through his suffering he prepared the materials ([link]1 Chron. 18:7-11[/link]; [link]22:2-5[/link], [link]14-16a[/link]; [link]28:2[/link]; [link]29:2-9[/link]), gained the proper ground for the building of the temple ([link]1 Chron. 21:18-30[/link]; [link]2 Chron. 3:1[/link]), and prepared Solomon, the builder, and all the helpers ([link]1 Chron. 28:9-11[/link], [link]20-21[/link]). Second, Solomon typifies Christ ([link]Matt. 12:42[/link]) in His speaking God's word of wisdom ([link]Matt. 13:35[/link]), in His building the church as the temple of God ([link]Matt. 16:18[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 3:16[/link]; [link]Eph. 2:21-22[/link]), and in His being glorified in the kingdom of God and its splendor ([link]Isa. 9:7[/link]; [link]Rev. 11:15[/link]). These two types are strong evidences that the history of the kings of Israel is related to God's eternal economy, which concerns Christ as the embodiment of God and the church as the organic Body of Christ.</note>

        <note num="1">In marrying the daughter of the king of Egypt, Solomon followed his father in indulging his lust to gain a Gentile wife ([link]2 Sam. 11[/link]). This was the annulling of the separation of God's holy people from the people of Satan's cosmos, the evil world. Solomon was not regulated and restricted by the law of God, in which God charged Israel not to marry the Gentiles, because the Gentiles would cause Israel to worship idols ([link]Exo. 34:16[/link]; [link]Deut. 7:3-4[/link]; [link]Josh. 23:12-13[/link]). In this matter Solomon was disobedient to God in carrying out God's economy, which included the destroying of all the idol-worshipping Gentiles in the land ([link]Deut. 7:2[/link]). Solomon's marriage to an Egyptian also laid a foundation for his future fall in corruption and ruin ([link]ch. 11[/link]; cf. [link]Gal. 6:7-8[/link]).</note>

Solomon's wisdom was a shadow of the real wisdom that was to come. The real wisdom is God, and God is embodied in Christ ([link]Col. 2:9[/link]), who has become our wisdom to be in us ([link]1 Cor. 1:24[/link], [link]30[/link]), making us one with God and making us the same as God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead.

        <text>Then in the four hundred eightieth year after the children of Israel had come forth out of the land of Egypt, in the [xref]a[/xref]fourth year of his reign over Israel, in the month of Ziv (this is the second month), [note]1[/note]Solomon began to build the [note]2[/note][xref]b[/xref]house of Jehovah.</text>
        <note num="1">Solomon's building of the temple was according to the promise of Jehovah given to David ([link]5:5[/link]; [link]2 Sam. 7:12-13[/link]). Solomon built the temple according to his father King David's charge, with the materials prepared by David ([link]1 Chron. 22:6-11[/link], [link]14-16[/link]), according to God's own design given to David ([link]1 Chron. 28:11-19[/link]; cf. [link]Gen. 6:14-16[/link]; [link]Exo. 25:8-9[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">The temple replaced the tabernacle as God's dwelling on earth. The temple first signifies the incarnated Christ, the embodiment of God ([link]Col. 2:9[/link]), as God's dwelling on the earth ([link]John 2:19-21[/link]; [link]1:14[/link]). It also signifies the church, including all the believers, the members of Christ, as the enlargement of Christ to be God's dwelling on the earth ([link]1 Cor. 3:16-17[/link]; [link]6:19[/link]; [link]Eph. 2:21-22[/link]). Christ and the church are one, Christ being the Head and the church being the Body ([link]Eph. 1:22-23[/link]; [link]Col. 1:18a[/link]). The Body is the enlargement of the Head for God's dwelling. Hence, God's dwelling in Christ is God's dwelling in the church.[br/][br/]Solomon and the temple built by him typify Christ and His Body, the church, respectively, as the center, the reality, and the goal of God's eternal economy. Since Solomon and the temple play the strongest roles in the history of Israel and occupy a wide realm in such a history, they are strong evidence that the history of Israel is very much related to the accomplishing of God's eternal economy in the Old Testament in the way of typology. This is a clear indication that the books of history were written from the point of view of God's eternal economy concerning Christ and the church.[br/][br/]The temple was built on the ground of Mount Zion, called Mount Moriah, where Abraham offered Isaac ([link]Gen. 22:2[/link]) and David offered his sacrifice to Jehovah ([link]1 Chron. 21:18-22:1[/link]; [link]2 Chron. 3:1[/link]). This is a further indication that the Bible is a record concerning God's economy. Isaac was a type of Christ, who was crucified in the same place where Isaac was offered to God (see notes [link]2[sup]1[/sup] in Gen. 22[/link] and [link]1[sup]1[/sup] in Mark 10[/link]).</note>

Furthermore, with the exception of the Ark ([link]v. 19[/link]), the size and number of the furnishings and the utensils were greatly enlarged ([link]2 Chron. 4:1-8[/link]). This indicates that although Christ Himself (signified by the Ark) cannot be enlarged, our experience of Christ in all His riches, as signified by the temple and its furnishings and utensils, should be greatly increased and enlarged ([link]Eph. 3:8[/link], [link]14-19[/link]; [link]Phil. 3:7-14[/link]) to match His enlarged expression.

        <note num="1">I.e., the Holy Place.

The temple refers to both Christ ([link]John 2:19-22[/link]) and the church ([link]1 Cor. 3:16[/link]; [link]Eph. 2:21[/link]), whereas the side chambers signify the church in the aspect of its being the extension of Christ as His fullness.</note>

As God, Christ in His incarnation put on man's flesh ([link]John 1:14[/link]; [link]Heb. 2:14[/link]). Having become a man in the flesh, i.e., a man in the old creation, He needed to be transformed in His human part. Such a transformed Christ is now the foundation stone, the cornerstone, the living stone, the precious stone, and the topstone in God's divine building ([link]Isa. 28:16[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 3:11[/link]; [link]Eph. 2:20[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 2:4[/link]; [link]Rev. 4:3[/link]; [link]Zech. 4:7[/link]). The stones in the temple also signify the believers in Christ who have been transformed by Christ as the stone ([link]Matt. 16:18[/link]; [link]John 1:42[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 2:5[/link]; [link]Rev. 21:11[/link], [link]14[/link], [link]19-20[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">The different kinds of wood used in constructing the temple signify different aspects of Christ's humanity.

[link]Gen. 6:14[/link] and note 2). Cedar trees grew on the mountains of Lebanon ([link]Psa. 104:16[/link]); thus, cedar ([link]vv. 9[/link], [link]10b[/link], [link]15a[/link], [link]16[/link], [link]36[/link]) signifies Christ's humanity in resurrection, the resurrected Christ (cf.

Olive oil typifies the Spirit of God; hence, olive wood ([link]vv. 23[/link], [link]31-33[/link]) signifies Christ's humanity in the Spirit of God, the anointed Christ ([link]Heb. 1:9[/link]).

        <note num="1">Solomon built his palaces in association with God's dwelling ([link]vv. 1-12[/link]). Solomon's palaces were built with the same materials as those used for the temple. This indicates that his palaces were of the same rank as God's dwelling. God's dwelling was for God to be worshipped by His people. Solomon's palaces were for him to administrate his government over the people. Solomon's government was the governmental administration of God over His people ([link]2 Chron. 9:8[/link]). The fact that Solomon's palaces were built in association with God's dwelling indicates that God's government over His people should go along with His worship by His people.[br/][br/]In the type the king's palaces and God's temple were separate, whereas in the New Testament reality these two are one building. The New Testament believers are on the one hand God's priests to serve, to worship, God and on the other hand God's kings to reign for God ([link]1 Pet. 2:5[/link], [link]9[/link]; [link]Rev. 1:6[/link]; [link]5:10[/link]; [link]20:6[/link]).

        <text>He was the son of a widow [i]and[/i] of the tribe of [note]1[/note]Naphtali, and his father was a man of [note]2[/note]Tyre, a bronze worker; and he was full of [xref]a[/xref]wisdom and understanding and skill to do all kinds of work in bronze. And he [note]3[/note]came to King Solomon and did all his work.</text>
        <note num="1">Cf. [link]2 Chron. 2:14[/link], which says that Hiram's mother was "a woman of the daughters of Dan." The tribe of Dan is the tribe of idolatry that caused God's people to stumble and fall from God's way ([link]Gen. 49:17[/link] and note). The fact that Hiram's mother was of Dan indicates that Hiram's origin, like that of all men, was of sin ([link]Psa. 51:5[/link]; cf. [link]John 8:44a[/link]). That Hiram became one who was "of the tribe of Naphtali," the tribe of resurrection, i.e., of transformation ([link]Gen. 49:21[/link] and note), signifies that in order to be a part of God's building and participate in its building work, we need to be transferred from the "tribe of Dan" into the "tribe of Naphtali" by being regenerated and transformed in Christ's resurrection ([link]1 Pet. 1:3[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 3:18[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">Tyre was a Gentile city noted for its commerce; hence, it was one with Satan ([link]Ezek. 28:12[/link], [link]16[/link]). Hiram's father was the source of Hiram's skill in working with bronze. However, his father died, leaving his mother, the source of his existence, a widow. This signifies that in order to be useful to God for the building of the church, God's dwelling place, we need to acquire the secular learning and skills but must allow our "Tyrian" father, the source of these things, to die. Furthermore, our "Danite" mother must be "widowed" (separated from the worldly source), and we must be of the "tribe of Naphtali," the tribe of transformation. Thus, we continue to possess the learning and the skills without the source, our existence (mother) is no longer linked to our worldly origin, and we are in resurrection. Moses and the apostle Paul are excellent examples of this principle.</note>
        <note num="3">Hiram was brought from Tyre to King Solomon in Jerusalem ([link]vv. 13-14[/link]), the place where the temple was to be built. Jerusalem typifies the church. Both today's Solomon (Christ) and God's present building are in the church. Thus, in order to be useful to God for His building, we must gain secular skills, live in resurrection, and come to the proper ground, the ground of the church.</note>

        <text>[xref]a[/xref]And he formed the two bronze [note]1[/note]pillars; [note]2[/note]eighteen cubits was the height of [note]3[/note]each pillar, and a line of [note]2[/note]twelve cubits encompassed [note]3[/note]each pillar.</text>
        <note num="1">The two large pillars set up by Solomon in front of the temple were a striking feature of the exterior of the temple. In the Scriptures the pillar is a sign, a testimony, of God's building ([link]Gen. 28:18-19a[/link], [link]22a[/link]; [link]1 Kings 7:15-22[/link]; [link]Gal. 2:9[/link]; [link]1 Tim. 3:15[/link]; [link]Rev. 3:12[/link]). That there were two pillars here (two being the number of testimony) indicates that these pillars stood as a testimony, like a signboard, of what God's building is. The names of the two pillars ([link]v. 21[/link] and notes) testify that the Lord will establish His building (cf. [link]Matt. 16:18[/link]) and that genuine strength is in the building (cf. [link]Eph. 3:17-18[/link]). In typology, bronze signifies God's judgment ([link]Exo. 27:1-8[/link]; [link]Num. 21:8-9[/link]; [link]John 3:14[/link]). The temple's two bronze pillars signify the Christ who was judged by God and who became the supporting strength of God's dwelling on the earth (cf. [link]Rev. 1:15[/link] and notes 1 and 2). This Christ should be experienced by the believers in the church life and should be wrought into them to constitute them pillars to support God's building.</note>
        <note num="2">Eighteen cubits (the height of each pillar &amp;#8212; [link]v. 15[/link]; [link]2 Kings 25:17[/link]) is half of three units of twelve cubits (the circumference of the pillar). The number three signifies the Triune God, and the number twelve signifies the mingling (multiplying) of the Triune God (three) with His creature man (four). It signifies further that this mingling is complete and perfect in God's eternal administration (cf. note [link]12[sup]2[/sup] in Rev. 21[/link] and note [link]2[sup]4[/sup] in Rev. 22[/link]). Thus, if we would be pillars as a testimony of God's building, we must first judge ourselves under God's judgment (bronze &amp;#8212; [link]Matt. 16:24[/link]; [link]Gal. 2:20[/link]) and then be filled, saturated, and permeated with the Triune God. That each pillar is a half indicates that no matter how completely we are mingled with the Triune God, we are not complete in ourselves; we need others to match us (cf. note [link]16[sup]1[/sup] in Exo. 26[/link]).</note>

        <text>And he made two [note]1[/note]capitals of molten bronze to set upon the tops of the pillars; the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the second capital was five cubits.</text>
        <note num="1">The two bronze capitals covered the tops of the pillars. The total height of each capital was five cubits ([link]v. 16[/link]; [link]2 Chron. 3:15[/link]), divided between the base (three cubits &amp;#8212; [link]2 Kings 25:17[/link]) and the two bowls on top of each capital ([link]2 Chron. 4:12[/link]). The number three here signifies the process of resurrection; the number two, a testimony ([link]Deut. 17:6[/link]); the number five, the bearing of responsibility (see note [link]2[sup]1[/sup] in Matt. 25[/link]); and the number ten (the combined height of the two capitals), fullness in bearing responsibility. The bowls were the glory, beauty, decoration, and crown of the capitals. They were covered with nets of checker work (like a trellis) and wreaths of chain work ([link]v. 17[/link]). These signify the complicated and intermixed situation in which those who are pillars in God's building ([link]Gal. 2:9[/link]; [link]Rev. 3:12[/link]) live and bear responsibility. Lilies were on the nets ([link]v. 19[/link]), and two rows of one hundred pomegranates were on the wreaths ([link]v. 18[/link]; [link]2 Kings 25:17[/link]; [link]2 Chron. 3:16[/link]; [link]4:13[/link]). Lilies signify a life of faith in God ([link]S.S. 2:1-2[/link]; [link]Matt. 6:28[/link], [link]30[/link]; [link]Gal. 2:20[/link]), and pomegranates, having many seeds, signify the expression of the riches of the divine life. A life of faith that expresses the riches of the divine life is the issue of the experience of Christ's crucifixion in and through the complicated and intermixed situation (cf. [link]2 Cor. 4:7-18[/link]). In spiritual significance the bowls of the capitals are a testimony (two) indicating that those who place themselves under God's judgment (bronze), counting themselves as nothing, are able to bear responsibility (five) in full (ten) and express the riches of the divine life (pomegranates) in the midst of a complicated and intermixed situation (the checker work and chain work) out of the process of resurrection (the base of the capitals, three cubits in height) because they do not live by themselves but by God (lilies). A believer who is a pillar as a sign of God's building must bear the testimony of living by faith to bear responsibility and express the riches of life through the process of resurrection under the crossing out of the checker work and the restriction of the chain work.[br/][br/]For additional details concerning the two bronze pillars and their capitals in relation to spiritual experience, see [i]Life-study of Genesis,[/i] Messages Eighty-three and Eighty-four.</note>

        <note num="1">[link]Verses 31-48[/link] mention seven conditions concerning God's listening to the prayers of His elect. In this, the last, condition three things are stressed ([link]v. 48[/link]): the Holy Land, typifying Christ as the portion allotted by God to the believers (see note [link]7[sup]1[/sup] in Deut. 8[/link]); the holy city, signifying the kingdom of God in Christ ([link]Psa. 48:1-2[/link]); and the holy temple, signifying God's house, the church, on the earth ([link]Eph. 2:21[/link]; [link]1 Tim. 3:15[/link]). These are the three crucial things regarding God's economy. During the Babylonian captivity Daniel prayed toward the Holy Land, the holy city, and the holy temple three times a day by opening his window toward Jerusalem ([link]Dan. 6:10[/link]). This indicates that God will listen to our prayer when our prayer to God is toward Christ, the kingdom of God, and the house of God as the goal in God's eternal economy. This means that no matter for whom we are praying, our prayers should be aimed at the interests of God, i.e., at Christ and the church as God's interests on earth, for the fulfilling of God's economy.</note>

        <note num="1">For God to maintain the cause of His people means that He executes justice regarding their situation. Throughout the centuries God has maintained the cause of His people Israel. When they were wrong with Him, He chastised them and disciplined them through the hands of the Gentile powers, including the Babylonian, Persian, Grecian, and Roman empires. But when these nations went too far in dealing with Israel, God maintained Israel's cause, punishing those who mistreated them (see note [link]5[sup]1[/sup] in Isa. 10[/link] and note [link]13[sup]1[/sup], par. 1, in Isa. 26[/link]). This indicates that behind the physical realm there is the spiritual realm, in which God governs the entire universe, executing justice for His people every day as each day requires.

        <note num="1">Solomon's decease ([link]vv. 41-43[/link]) was in gloomy disappointment. His glory fell off like the flower of grass ([link]Matt. 6:29[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 1:24[/link]), and his splendid career became "vanity of vanities," as he had preached ([link]Eccl. 1:2[/link]). However, what God did through him as a type of Christ remains forever (see note [link]1[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 2[/link]).[br/][br/]Under the light of the spiritual life, it is clear that Solomon was a wise man but not a spiritual man; a man of capability, not a man of life; a man whose wisdom was a gift, not a measure of life. The careers he accomplished were evidences of his capacity from his God-given gift of wisdom, not manifestations of the ability of the maturity of the divine life. Capability apart from life is like a snake, poisoning God's people; life is like a dove, supplying God's people with life. Cf. note [link]18[sup]1[/sup] in Ruth 4[/link].[br/][br/]Solomon's enjoyment of the God-given good land reached the highest level through his God-given gift. However, because of his small measure in the maturity of the spiritual life, he was cut off from the enjoyment of the good land in God's economy because of his unbridled indulgence of his lust. His father David, a man according to God's heart, failed in this same gross and ugly sin ([link]2 Sam. 11[/link]). Solomon's failure in this satanic temptation was much greater than his father's. This caused his descendants to lose more than ninety percent of their kingdom and caused the people of God's elect to suffer division and confusion among themselves throughout many generations. Eventually, they lost the God-given land and became captives in the foreign lands of idol worship. The nation of Israel is still suffering because of Solomon's failure. What a warning and an alarm this should be to us! We must be careful. Even a little failure in the indulgence of lust can damage the church and kill the splendid aspects of the church life.</note>

Eventually, the requirement to provide these daily necessities became a factor in the people's rejecting of Solomon. Jeroboam took Solomon's extraordinary, luxurious life and his heavy levying on the people as the cause of his rebellion. Solomon lost the kingdom partly due to his indulgence in lust and idol worship and partly because the people were burdened by the need to provide for Solomon's vast family.</note>

        <note num="1">Jeroboam's apostasy ([link]vv. 25-33[/link]; [link]13:33-34[/link]) consisted of his (1) making two calves (idols) of gold, putting one in Bethel and the other in Dan, in order to distract his people from worshipping God in Jerusalem ([link]vv. 25-30[/link]), thus breaking God's ordination of having one unique worship center in the Holy Land for keeping the unity, the oneness, of the children of Israel ([link]Deut. 12:2-18[/link]); (2) building a temple at the high places and appointing priests from among the common people who were not of the tribe of Levi ([link]v. 31[/link]; [link]13:33b[/link]; [link]2 Chron. 13:9[/link]); (3) ordaining a feast on the fifteenth day of the eighth month (the month he had devised in his own heart), like the feast that was in Judah ([link]vv. 32a[/link], [link]33b[/link]); (4) offering sacrifices on the altar at Bethel to the calves that he had made, and placing in Bethel the priests of the high places ([link]vv. 32b-33a[/link]); and (5) going up to the altar to burn incense ([link]v. 33b[/link]) although he was not a priest. The apostasy of Jeroboam can be considered a type of the apostasy in today's Christendom, with its divisive worship centers, its clergy-laity system, its self-ordained religious "feasts," and its idolatry.

        <note num="2">To set up a high place is to have a division. Hence, the significance of the high places is division. These places were a substitute and an alternative for the unique place chosen by God to preserve the oneness of His people (see note [link]5[sup]1[/sup] in Deut. 12[/link]). In this book two kings &amp;#8212; Solomon and Jeroboam &amp;#8212; took the lead to set up the high places, the former because of the indulgence of lust (see note [link]7[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 11[/link]) and the latter because of ambition (see note [link]27[sup]1[/sup][/link]). Thus, the high places were related to lust, ambition, and idolatry. All the divisions among God's people are connected to these three evil things.[br/][br/]A high place is an elevation, something lifted above the common level. This indicates that a high place involves the exalting of something. In principle, every division in Christianity involves the uplifting, the exalting, of something other than Christ. Anything that is exalted above Christ, even biblical teachings and scriptural practices, can be used to set up a "high place" to cause division among God's people. See notes [link book="1 Cor." chapter="1"]2[sup]9[/sup][/link] and [link]9[sup]2[/sup] in 1 Cor. 1[/link].[br/][br/]The high places in the Old Testament are a matter of great significance, for they seriously damaged the ground of oneness among God's elect. Once these places were set up, they were not easily removed, even by the good kings ([link]15:14[/link]; [link]22:43[/link]; [link]2 Kings 12:3[/link]; [link]14:4[/link]; [link]15:4[/link], [link]35[/link]; cf.
