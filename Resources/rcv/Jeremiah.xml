        <note num="1">Lit., given. Jeremiah was born a priest ([link]v. 1[/link]), but he was called by God to be a prophet not only to the nation of Israel but also to all the nations ([link]vv. 5-8[/link]). Hence, he was a priest-prophet.[br][br]The content of Jeremiah's prophecy is God's carrying out of His economy through His chastisement of Israel, His elect, in love with His tender care, compassion, and sympathy, and His judgment on the nations in righteousness to match His love, that Israel may manifest Christ, who is their divine righteousness ([link]23:6[/link]; [link]33:16[/link]) as their centrality and universality, by their being made a new creation with the inner law of the divine life and the capacity of this life to know God ([link]31:33-34[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">The plucking up, the breaking down, and the destroying are Jehovah's tearing down, whereas the building up and the planting are Jehovah's exalting. This corresponds to the two meanings of Jeremiah's name (see note [link]1[sup]1[/sup][/link]). Jehovah's building up and His planting both involve His word. God's word is a building up of Christ and a planting of Christ for the exalting of Christ ([link]Acts 20:32[/link]; [link]Mark 4:14[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">On earth there is always a battle raging between God and those who oppose Him and fight against Him. God fights not by Himself directly but through His servants who have been sent by Him. This was the situation in Jeremiah's time. God sent His army &amp;#8212; a young man named Jeremiah &amp;#8212; to fight against those who opposed Him. Jeremiah was equipped by God to such an extent that he became a fortified city and an iron pillar and brass walls. Because God was with him to deliver him, the opposers would not prevail over him ([link]v. 19[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">Jeremiah, a book full of speaking concerning Israel's sin and God's wrath, chastisement, and punishment, reveals that God's intention in His economy is to be the fountain, the source, of living waters to dispense Himself into His chosen people for their satisfaction and enjoyment. The goal of this enjoyment is to produce the church, God's counterpart, as God's increase, God's enlargement, to be God's fullness for His expression ([link]John 3:29-30[/link]; [link]Eph. 3:16-19[/link], [link]21[/link]). This is the heart's desire, the good pleasure, of God in His economy ([link]Eph. 1:5[/link], [link]9[/link]; [link]3:9-11[/link]). The full development of this thought, sown as a seed in this verse, is in the New Testament ([link]John 4:10[/link], [link]14[/link]; [link]7:37-39[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 10:4[/link]; [link]12:13[/link]; [link]Rev. 22:1[/link], [link]17[/link]).[br][br]Israel should have drunk of God as the fountain of living waters that they might become His increase as His expression, but instead they committed two evils: they forsook God as their fountain, their source, and they turned to a source other than God. These two evils govern the entire book of Jeremiah. The hewing out of cisterns portrays Israel's toil in their human labor to make something (idols) to replace God. That the cisterns were broken and could hold no water indicates that apart from God Himself dispensed into us as living water, nothing can quench our thirst and make us God's increase for His expression ([link]John 4:13-14[/link]).</note>

        <note num="2">Israel's forsaking of God for idols and their breaking of God's commandments began with the worshipping of the golden calf at Mount Sinai ([link]Exo. 32:1-6[/link]). Later, in his respeaking of the divine law Moses charged Israel especially that when they entered the good land, they were to tear down the idols, destroy the places of idol worship, and slaughter the idol worshippers ([link]Deut. 7:2[/link], [link]5[/link]). Israel, however, did not obey the commandment to utterly destroy the idol worshippers. As a result, Israel could not fully possess the good land, and there was war repeatedly between Israel and the people in the land. After David had fought all the inhabitants of the land and gained nearly the entire land, and Solomon, his son, had built the temple in about 1000 B.C., in his old age Solomon was led by his many heathen wives to worship idols ([link]1 Kings 11:1-8[/link]). Nearly all his descendants continued his apostasy. Eventually, Israel's worshipping of idols and their breaking of the law reached its peak at the time of Jeremiah. At that time Israel was in the sunset of the divine revelation. Cf. note [link]12[sup]1[/sup] in Judg. 2[/link].</note>

        <note num="1">Jehovah came in to correct His hypocritical worshippers, and Jeremiah reacted to Jehovah's correction of Israel ([link]8:18-19[/link], [link]21-22[/link]; [link]9:1-2[/link]; [link]10:19-25[/link]). The prophet's reaction was very tender, sympathetic, and compassionate.[br][br]According to this book, God's love is a composition of His tender care, compassion, and sympathy. Even while He chastises His elect people Israel, He is compassionate toward them ([link]Lam. 3:22-23[/link]). In His chastising of Israel, God can be compared to a father who weeps as he disciplines his child because he loves the child. In this book Jeremiah wept on God's behalf; his weeping expressed God's feeling. We may say that God wept within Jeremiah's weeping, for in his weeping Jeremiah was one with God. Because Jeremiah often wept ([link]13:17[/link]; [link]Lam. 2:11[/link]; [link]3:48[/link]), even wailed, he is called the weeping prophet.</note>

The law, which itself is holy, righteous, good, and spiritual ([link]Rom. 7:12[/link], [link]16[/link], [link]14a[/link]), became weak through man's flesh ([link]Rom. 8:3a[/link]).

Through their failure under the test of the law, Israel was to learn that they were unable to keep the law and that they had no righteousness by the law ([link]Rom. 8:3a[/link]; [link]9:31[/link]; [link]10:3[/link]). They were also to come to know that they needed Christ to be Jehovah as their righteousness ([link]23:6b[/link]; [link]33:16b[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 1:30[/link]), and they needed to have the divine life with its law in the new covenant of God ([link]31:31-34[/link]; [link]Heb. 8:8-12[/link]; [link]10:16-17[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">God was intending to judge the people of Israel, and He sent Jeremiah to tell them that He would use the Babylonians to punish them ([link]vv. 12-13[/link]).

As Jeremiah complained, God came in to speak to him for his encouragement and strengthening ([link]v. 11[/link]). This indicates that God was always with Jeremiah. In His speaking to Jeremiah, God spoke not as the Divine Being, as the Mighty One, but almost as if He were a man, talking in a very human and personal way. According to the record of this book, as God dealt with His people, He often spoke to them in such a way (e.g., [link]2:1-3:5[/link]; [link]3:12-4:2[/link]; [link]16:10-18[/link]).</note>

The riches of the supplying God dispensed into us as the trees constitute us with God's divinity and cause us to grow into God's measure ([link]Col. 2:19[/link]).

        <text>The word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,</text>
        </verse>
        <verse num="2">
        <text>Arise and go down to the [note]1[/note]potter's house, and there I will let you hear My words.</text>
        <note num="1">Jeremiah's word to Jehovah in [link]15:10-17:27[/link] indicates that there was something within Jeremiah that was different from God's thought regarding Israel. It might have been that the feeling within Jeremiah was that God's judgment upon Israel was too severe. After Jeremiah's complaining ([link]15:10[/link]), God came in to speak with Jeremiah, indicating to him that He was determined to use the Babylonians as iron to judge and punish Israel ([link]15:12[/link]). Following Jeremiah's experience in arguing with God, he wrote a section of his prophecy concerning Jehovah as the sovereign Potter, who has absolute right over Israel as His pottery ([link]vv. 1-10[/link]; cf. [link]Rom. 9:20-23[/link]). Jehovah as the sovereign Potter is able to work with the house of Israel, as the clay in His hand, in changeable ways according to Israel's condition ([link]vv. 6-10[/link]). This corrected Jeremiah's concept.</note>

        <text>Am I not able to do with you, O house of Israel, as this potter does? declares Jehovah. Indeed, as the clay is in the hand of the [xref]a[/xref]potter, so you are in My hand, O house of Israel.</text>

        <note num="1">Jehovah's further speaking in [link]vv. 11-23[/link] concerning the evil condition of Israel was His further vindication of Himself to Jeremiah.

[i]Shoot[/i] here indicates Christ's humanity; it also implies life. When Christ was born, a new, fresh sprout came forth from the stump of David (see note [link]1[sup]1[/sup] in Isa. 11[/link]). This was the beginning of the fulfillment of Jehovah's promise concerning the raising up of Christ as the Shoot of David.</note>
        <note num="2">Christ's reigning as King implies His resurrection and ascension. Having passed through resurrection and having entered into ascension, Christ is now the King of kings, the Lord of Lords, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth ([link]Rev. 17:14[/link]; [link]19:16[/link]; [link]1:5[/link]). The word here concerning Christ will be fulfilled in the millennium ([link]Zech. 14:9[/link]; [link]Rev. 11:15[/link]; [link]20:6[/link]). See note [link]17[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 3[/link].</note>

        <note num="1">[i]Jehovah our righteousness[/i] refers to Christ in His divinity, and [i]a righteous Shoot[/i] ([link]v. 5[/link]), to Christ in His humanity. The name here indicates that Christ, as a descendant of David, is not merely a man but is also the very Jehovah who created the heavens and the earth, selected Abraham, established the race of Israel, and was the Lord of David, the One whom he called Lord ([link]Matt. 22:42-45[/link]; cf. [link]Rev. 5:5[/link]; [link]22:16[/link]). Christ came as a Shoot who is Jehovah Himself to be the righteousness of God's chosen people.</note>
        <note num="2">[i]Our[/i] here indicates that Christ becomes one with us to be our righteousness ([link]1 Cor. 1:30[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 5:21[/link]). Christ is made our righteousness based on His redemption. As the righteous Shoot ([link]v. 5[/link]), Christ came in the flesh as the descendant of David to die on the cross and shed His blood in order to wash away our sins and accomplish redemption ([link]Eph. 1:7[/link]; [link]Heb. 9:22[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 1:18-19[/link]). With His redemption as the basis, we can believe into Him to receive God's forgiveness ([link]Acts 10:43[/link]), and God can justify us ([link]Rom. 3:24[/link], [link]26[/link]), make Christ our righteousness, and clothe us with the robe of righteousness ([link]Isa. 61:10[/link]). This opens the way for Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God ([link]Col. 2:9[/link]) to enter into us as our life ([link]Col. 3:4a[/link]), our inner law of life ([link]31:33[/link]), and our everything, to dispense Himself into our entire being for the accomplishing of God's eternal economy.</note>
        <note num="3">Israel's evil and wickedness prepared the way for Christ to come in to be their righteousness. Although Israel forsook God for idols ([link]2:13[/link]) and became incurably evil ([link]13:23[/link]; [link]17:9[/link]), because of His compassions, lovingkindness, faithfulness, and eternal love ([link]31:3[/link]; [link]Lam. 3:22-23[/link]), God would never give up His elect yet distracted people. While He was condemning, punishing, and chastising Israel, He intended to be incarnated as a Shoot unto David so that He could be His people's righteousness. Based on Christ's coming as Jehovah to be their righteousness, the evil race of Israel can be restored. Eventually, Israel will manifest Christ, who is their righteousness, as their centrality (their being) and their universality (their expression). This manifestation will consummate in the New Jerusalem ([link]Rev. 21:12[/link]).</note>

Eventually, through the new covenant God will make the believers and Israel a new creation ([link]2 Cor. 5:17[/link]; [link]Gal. 6:15[/link]), which will ultimately consummate in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth for eternity ([link]Rev. 21:1-3[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">See note [link]10[sup]1[/sup] in Heb. 8[/link]. The center, the content, and the reality of the new covenant is the inner law of life ([link]Rom. 8:2[/link]). In its essence, this law refers to the divine life, and the divine life is the Triune God, who is embodied in the all-inclusive Christ ([link]Col. 2:9[/link]) and realized as the life-giving Spirit ([link]1 Cor. 15:45[/link]), and who has been processed and consummated to become everything to His chosen people.[br][br]According to its life, the law of the new covenant is the Triune God, and according to its function, it is the almighty divine capacity. This divine capacity can do everything in us for the carrying out of God's economy. According to this capacity we can know God, live God, and be constituted with God in His life and nature that we may become His increase, His enlargement, to be His fullness for His eternal expression ([link]Eph. 1:22-23[/link]; [link]3:19-21[/link]). Furthermore, the capacity of the inner law of life constitutes us the members of the Body of Christ ([link]1 Cor. 12:27[/link]; [link]Eph. 5:30[/link]) with all kinds of functions ([link]Rom. 12:4-8[/link]; [link]Eph. 4:11[/link], [link]16[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">The writing of the law of life on our heart mentioned here corresponds to the New Testament teaching concerning the spreading of the divine life from the center of our being, our spirit, to the circumference, our heart (see notes [link]10[sup]1[/sup], par. 1, in Heb. 8[/link], [link]9[sup]2[/sup] in Rom. 8[/link], and [link]17[sup]1[/sup] in Eph. 3[/link]). God writes His law on our heart by moving from our spirit into our heart to inscribe what He is into our being. Cf. note [link]3[sup]4[/sup] in 2 Cor. 3[/link].</note>

        <note num="1">To know God is to live God. Through the spontaneous, automatic function of the divine life within us, we have the capacity to know God, to live God, and even to be one with God in His life and nature so that we may be His corporate expression. See note [link]3[sup]1[/sup] in John 17[/link].</note>
        <note num="2">Forgiveness implies redemption and even equals redemption ([link]Eph. 1:7[/link]; [link]Col. 1:14[/link]). In the new covenant God forgives the iniquity of His people based on Christ's redemption ([link]Heb. 9:22[/link]).[br][br]As seen in [link]23:5-6[/link] and in [link chapter="31"]vv. 33-34[/link], God's way to make Christ everything to His elect is by the way of righteousness, redemption, and the divine life with its law and capacity. These three matters, revealed intrinsically in Jeremiah's prophecy, are fully developed in the New Testament. See note [link]6[sup]2[/sup] in ch. 23[/link].</note>
        <note num="3">Jeremiah reveals what God wants from us, what we are in our fallen condition, and what Christ is to us. God wants us to take Him as our source and to drink of Him so that He may become the river of water of life within us ([link]2:13[/link]; cf. [link]John 7:37-39[/link]; [link]Rev. 22:1[/link]). However, we forsook Him, and in our fallen condition we became hopeless, utterly corrupt, incurable, and unchangeable ([link]13:23[/link]; [link]17:9[/link]). But Christ has come to be our righteousness ([link]23:5-6[/link]) and our inner life ([link]v. 33[/link]). Outwardly, He is our righteousness for us to be justified by God, and inwardly, He is the divine life to fill us, to make us one with God, and even to constitute us with God that we may live God ([link]Phil. 1:21a[/link]). Christ's being our righteousness and our inner life causes us to be a corporate Body, the organism of the Triune God, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem. These matters are the kernel of the book of Jeremiah, and they are also the complete teaching of the entire Bible.</note>

Furthermore, they would have spontaneously lived Him and would have been constituted with Him to be His testimony on earth. Those who are not one with God do not take His will and good pleasure but express their opinions and pursue their preferences.

        <text>The word of Jehovah that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the [note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]nations:</text>
        <note num="1">The nations in [link]chs. 46-51[/link] typify nine different aspects of the world. Just as Israel as God's Old Testament elect was involved with the nations, the church as God's New Testament elect is involved with the world in its many aspects. Jeremiah presents a vivid picture of God's punishment and judgment on the nations so that we may know how to have a clear separation from the world and not be mixed with any of its aspects ([link]John 12:31[/link]; [link]17:14-21[/link]; [link]Gal. 6:14[/link]; [link]2 Pet. 1:4[/link]; [link]1 John 2:15-17[/link]). God will come in to judge the world in all its aspects and to make a clear distinction between the church, which is today's Israel ([link]Gal. 6:16[/link] and note 4), and every aspect of the world.[br/]Jeremiah prophesied concerning the nations because in His economy God needs them. On the one hand, God needs His chosen people to express Him; on the other hand, He needs another people, the nations, to behold and admire this expression, which is His masterpiece ([link]Eph. 2:10[/link]), the New Jerusalem. The nations around the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth ([link]Rev. 21:24[/link], [link]26[/link]; [link]22:2b[/link]) will eventually come from the nations concerning which Jeremiah and other Old Testament prophets prophesied.</note>

        <text>Concerning [note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]Moab: / Thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: / Woe to Nebo, for it is destroyed; / Kiriathaim is put to shame; it is captured; / The lofty retreat is put to shame and dismayed.</text>
        <note num="1">Moab, the first forefather of the Moabites, was born of Lot through his committing incest with his daughters ([link]Gen. 19:30-38[/link]). Moab as a nation typifies the world of fleshly lust that corrupts and frustrates God's chosen people, through the greedy religionists, from following and walking with God in His holy way ([link]Num. 25:1-5[/link]; [link]2 Pet. 2:15[/link]; [link]Rev. 2:14[/link]). It was Moab who hired Balaam, the Gentile prophet, to stumble the children of Israel ([link]Num. 22:1-21[/link]; [link]Deut. 23:4[/link]).[br][br]The Moabites were not allowed to enter into the assembly of Jehovah even to the tenth generation ([link]Deut. 23:3[/link]). However, Ruth, a Moabitess, became the mother of one of the prominent forefathers of Christ ([link]Matt. 1:5b[/link]) because of her allegiance to Israel in the interest of God ([link]Ruth 1:14-18[/link]). This indicates that although the Moabites were condemned, at a certain time God had compassion on them.</note>

        <text>The word which Jehovah spoke concerning [note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]Babylon, concerning the land of the Chaldeans, through Jeremiah the prophet:</text>
        <note num="1">The origin and initiation of Babylon was Babel ([link]Gen. 11:7-9[/link]). Babel was built by Nimrod, a descendant of Ham, and was the beginning of human government on earth formed in opposition to God ([link]Gen. 10:6-11[/link]; [link]Dan. 2:31-32[/link], [link]38[/link]). It was a land full of idols, where man worshipped idols, exalted man's self, and opposed God ([link]v. 38b[/link]; [link]Josh. 24:2[/link]; [link]Gen. 11:3-4[/link]). Babel had its continuation in Babylon, which, in the sight of God, is the consummation of human government. Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, was even identified with Satan as Satan's embodiment ([link]Isa. 14:4[/link], [link]11-15[/link]). It was this Babylon that destroyed God's holy city and His holy temple and carried God's holy people and the vessels of God's temple into captivity ([link]2 Chron. 36:17-20[/link]). The coming restored Roman Empire under Antichrist, and the Roman Church, will both, in the spiritual sense, be called Babylon the Great ([link]Rev. 17:5[/link]; [link]18:2[/link]). Hence, Babylon typifies the world, both physically and spiritually, that worships idols, exalts man, and rebels against God to the uttermost, all of which was or will be utterly destroyed by God ([link]51:11[/link]; [link]Rev. 14:8[/link]; [link]16:19b[/link]; [link]17:16[/link]; [link]18:8-10[/link]).[br][br]God will judge Babylon to such an extent that nothing of Babylon will remain in the universe. Both Isaiah and Jeremiah prophesied that once Babylon has been destroyed, it will not be restored ([link]Isa. 14:22-23[/link]; [link]Jer. 50:39[/link]; [link]51:62[/link]). When God destroys both the religious and the political Babylon at the end of the age, that will be the end of the judgment on Babylon prophesied in [link]chs. 50-51[/link]. After this, there will be no more human government on earth. See [link]Dan. 2:32-34[/link] and notes.</note>
