        <text>Paul and Timothy, [xref]a[/xref]slaves of Christ Jesus, to all the [xref]b[/xref]saints in Christ Jesus who are in [note]1[/note][xref]c[/xref]Philippi, [note]2[/note]with the [note]3[/note][xref]d[/xref]overseers and [note]4[/note][xref]e[/xref]deacons:</text>
        <note num="1">Philippi was the chief city in the province of Macedonia of the ancient Roman Empire ([link]Acts 16:12[/link]). Through Paul's first ministry journey to Europe ([link]Acts 16:10-12[/link]), the first church in Europe was raised up in that city.</note>
        <note num="2">Here it is not "the saints...[i]and[/i] the overseers and deacons"; rather, it is "the saints...[i]with[/i] the overseers and deacons." This is highly significant in that it indicates that in the local church the saints, the overseers, and the deacons are not three groups. The church has only one group, composed of all the saints (including the overseers and deacons), who are the components of a local church. This indicates further that in any locality there should be just one church with one group of people, comprising all the saints in that locality.</note>
        <note num="3">Overseers are the elders in a local church ([link]Acts 20:17[/link], [link]28[/link]). [i]Elder[/i] denotes the person, and [i]overseer[/i] the function. An overseer is an elder in function. Here overseers are mentioned instead of elders, indicating that the elders were fulfilling their responsibility.</note>
        <note num="4">The Greek word means [i]serving ones.[/i] The deacons are the serving ones in a local church and are under the direction of the overseers ([link]1 Tim. 3:8[/link]). This verse, showing that a local church is composed of the saints, with overseers to take the lead and deacons to serve, indicates that the church in Philippi was in good order.</note>

        <text>For your [note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]fellowship unto [i]the furtherance of[/i] the [note]2[/note][xref]b[/xref]gospel from the first day until now,</text>
        <note num="1">[i]Fellowship[/i] here means [i]participation, communication.[/i] See note [link]26[sup]1[/sup] in Rom. 15[/link]. The saints in Philippi had fellowship unto the gospel, participating in the furtherance of the gospel through the apostle Paul's ministry. This participation included their financial contributions to the apostle ([link]4:10[/link], [link]15-16[/link]), which issued in the furtherance of the gospel. This kind of fellowship, which kept them from being individualistic and diversely minded, implies that they were one with the apostle Paul and with one another. This gave them the ground for their experience and enjoyment of Christ, which is the main point of this book. The Christ-experiencing and -enjoying life is a life in the furtherance of the gospel, a gospel-preaching life, not individualistic but corporate. Hence, there is the fellowship unto the furtherance of the gospel. The more fellowship we have in the furtherance of the gospel, the more Christ we experience and enjoy. This kills our self, ambition, preference, and choice.</note>
        <note num="2">Concerning the gospel, in this book Paul used several significant terms: [i]fellowship unto[/i]... the gospel, [i]the defense and confirmation of the gospel[/i] ([link]v. 7[/link]), [i]the advancement of the gospel[/i] ([link]v. 12[/link]), and [i]the faith of the gospel[/i] ([link]v. 27[/link]). Paul's preaching of Christ as the gospel included fellowship, defense, confirmation, advancement, and the faith. In contrast, the Judaistic believers preached Christ out of rivalry, factiousness, selfish ambition, envy, and strife, and did not cause the gospel to advance.</note>

        <verse num="7">
        <text>Even as it is right for me to think this concerning you all because you have me in your heart, since both in my [xref]a[/xref]bonds and in the [note]1[/note][xref]b[/xref]defense and confirmation of the gospel you are all [note]2[/note]fellow partakers [note]3[/note]with me of grace.</text>
        <note num="1">On the negative side, the defense of the gospel is for the resisting of perverting and distorting heresies, such as Judaism, dealt with in Galatians, and Gnosticism, dealt with in Colossians. On the positive side, the confirmation of the gospel is for the announcing of the revelations of God's mysteries concerning Christ and the church as unveiled in the apostle's Epistles. In preaching such a gospel according to God's economy, Paul renounced religion, law, culture, ordinances, customs, habits, and every kind of "ism" &amp;#8212; everything that was apart from God's economy. Because Paul preached such a gospel, he was regarded as a troublemaker, a pest ([link]Acts 24:5[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">Fellow partakers of grace are those who share and enjoy the processed Triune God as grace. The apostle was such in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, and the saints in Philippi were fellow partakers with him in this grace.</note>
        <note num="3">Or, of my grace. Paul's grace was the grace that he enjoyed and that surpassed his sufferings in the defense and confirmation of the gospel. This grace was not God objectively; it was the Triune God processed to be his portion subjectively and experientially.</note>

        <note num="1">Lit., bowels; signifying inward affection, then, tender mercy and sympathy. In longing after the saints, the apostle was one with Christ even in the bowels, the tender inward parts, of Christ. This indicates that for Paul to enjoy Christ meant that he was one with Christ's inward parts, in which he enjoyed Christ as the supply of grace.</note>

        <note num="1">The Philippian believers had much love. Yet their love needed to abound, to overflow more and more, not foolishly but in full knowledge, not in ignorance but in all discernment, that they might approve by testing the things that differ and are more excellent. This should include the discerning of the differing preachings of the gospel in [link]vv. 15-18[/link] and of the different kinds of people in [link]3:2-3[/link].</note>
        <note num="2">Sensitive perception, moral tact. Paul's desire was that the Philippians, some of whom had been distracted from God's economy by the preaching of the Judaistic believers, would not love the Judaistic believers foolishly but would love them soberly with love that abounded in full knowledge and sensitive perception.</note>

Paul's affliction in bonds was due not to his preaching of the gospel but to his defense of the gospel. The Judaizers mixed the gospel with the law and circumcision. Paul defended it. This caused the riot which put him into bonds ([link]Acts 21:27-36[/link]).</note>

This was the outworking of the life, nature, and mind of Christ, who lived in the apostle. His experience of Christ was an enjoyment. Such a life rejoices no matter what the circumstances may be.</note>

        <note num="1">The same Greek word as in [link]2:12[/link]. The salvation here is the working out of the salvation in [link]2:12[/link]; it means to be sustained and strengthened to live and magnify Christ (see note [link]12[sup]4[/sup] in ch. 2[/link]). This requires the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</note>
        <note num="2">This is the supply of the Body of Christ, the church. Imprisonment did not isolate Paul from the Body of Christ or cut him off from the supply of the Body.</note>
        <note num="3">The Greek word refers to the supplying of all the needs of the chorus by the choragus, the leader of the chorus. The bountiful supply of the all-inclusive Spirit enabled Paul to live and magnify Christ in his sufferings for Him.</note>
        <note num="4">The revelation in the Bible concerning God, Christ, and the Spirit is progressive. The Spirit is mentioned first as the Spirit of God, in relation to creation ([link]Gen. 1:2[/link]). Then, He is mentioned as the Spirit of Jehovah, in the context of God's relationship with man ([link]Judg. 3:10[/link]; [link]1 Sam. 10:6[/link]); as the Holy Spirit, in relation to the conception and birth of Christ ([link]Luke 1:35[/link]; [link]Matt. 1:20[/link]); as the Spirit of Jesus, in relation to the Lord's human living ([link]Acts 16:7[/link]); as the Spirit of Christ, in relation to the Lord's resurrection ([link]Rom. 8:9[/link]); and here as the Spirit of Jesus Christ.[br][br]The Spirit of Jesus Christ is "the Spirit" mentioned in [link]John 7:39[/link]. This is not merely the Spirit of God before the Lord's incarnation but the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit with divinity, after the Lord's resurrection, compounded with the Lord's incarnation (humanity), human living under the cross, crucifixion, and resurrection. The holy anointing ointment in [link]Exo. 30:23-25[/link], a compound of olive oil and four kinds of spices, is a full type of this compound Spirit of God, who is now the Spirit of Jesus Christ. Here it is not the Spirit of Jesus ([link]Acts 16:7[/link]) or the Spirit of Christ ([link]Rom. 8:9[/link]) but the Spirit of Jesus Christ. The Spirit of Jesus is related mainly to the Lord's humanity and human living; the Spirit of Christ is related mainly to the Lord's resurrection. To experience the Lord's humanity, as illustrated in [link]2:5-8[/link], we need the Spirit of Jesus. To experience the power of the Lord's resurrection, as mentioned in [link]3:10[/link], we need the Spirit of Christ. In his suffering the apostle experienced both the Lord's suffering in His humanity and the Lord's resurrection. Hence, the Spirit to him was the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit of the Triune God. Such a Spirit has, and even is, the bountiful supply for a person like the apostle, who was experiencing and enjoying Christ in His human living and resurrection. Eventually, this compound Spirit of Jesus Christ becomes the seven Spirits of God, who are the seven lamps of fire before God's throne to carry out His administration on earth for the accomplishing of His economy concerning the church, and who are the seven eyes of the Lamb for the transfusing of all that He is into the church ([link]Rev. 1:4[/link]; [link]4:5[/link]; [link]5:6[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">In the apostle's suffering in his body, Christ was magnified, i.e., shown or declared to be great (without limitation), exalted, and extolled. The apostle's sufferings afforded him opportunity to express Christ in His unlimited greatness. The apostle would have only Christ magnified in him, not the law or circumcision. This book is concerned with the experience of Christ. To magnify Christ under any circumstances is to experience Him with the topmost enjoyment.</note>

He would not live the law but would live Christ, not be found in the law but be found in Christ ([link]3:9[/link]). Christ was not only his life but also his living. He lived Christ because Christ lived in him ([link]Gal. 2:20[/link]). He was one with Christ in both life and living. He and Christ had one life and one living. They lived together as one person. Christ lived within Paul as Paul's life, and Paul lived Christ without as Christ's living. The normal experience of Christ is to live Him, and to live Him is to magnify Him always, regardless of the circumstances.</note>
        <note num="2">[i]Gain[/i] here refers to being with Christ in a higher degree. But in fulfilling God's eternal purpose, being with Christ cannot compare with living Christ for His Body's sake. Hence, Paul chose to live Christ.</note>

        <note num="1">In [link]vv. 1-2[/link] the apostle appealed to the Philippians for their encouragement and consolation.

        <note num="3">Among the Philippians there was dissension in their thinking ([link]4:2[/link]), which troubled the apostle. Hence, he asked them to think the same thing, even the same one thing, that they might make his joy full.</note>
        <note num="4">This indicates that because of the dissension in their thinking, the Philippian believers had different levels of love. They did not have the same love toward all the saints for the keeping of oneness.</note>
        <note num="5">This indicates that the dissension among the Philippians was due to their not being joined in soul, to their not thinking the one thing in their mind, the leading part of their soul. The Philippians' problem was not with their spirit but with their soul, that is, with their mind. They had Christ in their spirit through regeneration, but they did not have Christ in their soul through transformation. Only by having Christ saturate and occupy their entire soul could they be made one in soul.</note>
        <note num="6">According to the context of this book, [i]the one thing[/i] here must refer to the subjective knowledge and experience of Christ ([link]1:20-21[/link]; [link]2:5[/link]; [link]3:7-9[/link]; [link]4:13[/link]).

        <note num="2">In [link]ch. 1[/link] the central point is to magnify Christ, to live Christ ([link]vv. 20-21[/link]). In [link]ch. 2[/link] it is to take Christ as our pattern, our model.

In [link]vv. 5-16[/link] there are four basic elements: Christ ([link]v. 5[/link]), salvation ([link]v. 12[/link]), God ([link]v. 13[/link]), and the word of life ([link]v. 16[/link]). The word of life works out the pattern by the operating God to apply salvation to our daily living. In this way we enjoy Christ and live Him, taking Him as our pattern.</note>

        <note num="2">Paul counted as loss on account of Christ not only the things of his former religion listed in [link]vv. 5[/link] and [link]6[/link] but all other things as well.</note>
        <note num="3">The excellency of the knowledge of Christ is derived from the excellency of His person. The Jews consider the law of God given through Moses the most excellent thing in human history; hence, they are zealous for the law. Paul participated in that zeal. But when Christ was revealed to him by God ([link]Gal. 1:15-16[/link]), he saw that the excellency, the supereminence, the supreme preciousness, the surpassing worth, of Christ far exceeded the excellency of the law. His knowledge of Christ issued in the excellency of the knowledge of Christ. On account of this, he counted as loss not only the law and the religion founded according to the law, but all things.</note>
        <note num="4">The phrase [i]as to,[/i] which may be rendered [i]according to,[/i] is used three times in [link]vv. 5-6[/link], with the law, zeal, and righteousness. The phrase [i]on account of,[/i] which may be rendered [i]because of,[/i] is used three times in [link]vv. 7-8[/link], with Christ (twice) and with the excellency of the knowledge of Christ. Christ stands in contrast to the law, the zeal for it, and the righteousness in it. The excellency of the knowledge of Christ and Christ Himself are in contrast to all things and to the law. On account of Christ and the excellency of the knowledge of Christ, Paul gave up the law, his zeal for it, the righteousness in it, and all other things. This indicates that Christ and the excellency of the knowledge of Christ are far superior to the law and all things.</note>
        <note num="5">Referring to dregs, rubbish, filth, that which is thrown to the dogs; hence, dog food, dung. There is no comparison between such things and Christ.</note>
        <note num="6">To know Christ is not merely to have the knowledge concerning Him but to gain His very person. Christ is the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead ([link]Col. 2:9[/link]) and the reality of the shadows of all positive things ([link]Col. 2:16-17[/link]). To gain something requires the paying of a price. To gain Christ is to experience, enjoy, and take possession of all His unsearchable riches ([link]Eph. 3:8[/link]) by paying a price.</note>

        <note num="1">Paul had been altogether in the Jewish religion under the law and had always been found by others in the law. But at his conversion he was transferred from the law and his former religion into Christ and became "a man in Christ" ([link]2 Cor. 12:2[/link]). Now he expected to be found in Christ by all who observed him &amp;#8212; the Jews, the angels, and the demons. This indicates that he aspired to have his whole being immersed in and saturated with Christ that all who observed him might find him fully in Christ. Only when we are found in Christ will Christ be expressed and magnified ([link]Phil. 1:20[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">"Not having my own righteousness...but... the righteousness which is out of God" was the condition in which Paul desired to be found in Christ.

        <note num="1">Paul lived in a condition of having not his own righteousness but the righteousness that is out of God, in order to know (to experience) Christ and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings. In [link]v. 8[/link] to have the excellency of the knowledge of Christ is by revelation. But to know Him here is by experience &amp;#8212; to have the experiential knowledge of Him, to experience Him in the full knowledge of Him. Paul first received the revelation of Christ, then sought the experience of Christ &amp;#8212; to know and enjoy Christ in an experiential way.</note>
        <note num="2">The power of Christ's resurrection is His resurrection life, which raised Him from the dead ([link]Eph. 1:19-20[/link]). The reality of the power of Christ's resurrection is the Spirit ([link]Rom. 1:4[/link]). To know, to experience, this power requires identification with Christ's death and conformity to it. Death is the base of resurrection. To experience the power of Christ's resurrection, we need to live a crucified life, as He did. Our conformity to His death affords the power of His resurrection a base from which to rise up that His divine life may be expressed in us.</note>
        <note num="3">The participation in Christ's sufferings ([link]Matt. 20:22-23[/link]; [link]Col. 1:24[/link]), a necessary condition for the experience of the power of His resurrection ([link]2 Tim. 2:11[/link]) by being conformed to His death. Paul was pursuing to know and experience not only the excellency of Christ Himself but also the life power of His resurrection and the participation in His sufferings. With Christ, the sufferings and death came first, followed by the resurrection; with us, the power of His resurrection comes first, followed by the participation in His sufferings and conformity to His death. We first receive the power of His resurrection; then by this power we are enabled to participate in His sufferings and live a crucified life in conformity to His death. Such sufferings are mainly for producing and building up the Body of Christ ([link]Col. 1:24[/link]).</note>
        <note num="4">To take Christ's death as the mold of one's life. Paul lived a crucified life continually, a life under the cross, just as Christ did in His human living. Through such a life the resurrection power of Christ is experienced and expressed. The mold of Christ's death refers to Christ's experience of continually putting to death His human life that He might live by the life of God ([link]John 6:57[/link]). Our life should be conformed to such a mold by our dying to our human life to live the divine life. Being conformed to the death of Christ is the condition for knowing and experiencing Him, the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings.</note>

        <note num="2">I.e., the outstanding resurrection, the extra-resurrection, which will be a prize to the overcoming saints. All believers who are dead in Christ will participate in the resurrection from the dead at the Lord's coming back ([link]1 Thes. 4:16[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 15:52[/link]). But the overcoming saints will enjoy an extra, outstanding portion of that resurrection. See note [link]35[sup]2[/sup] in Heb. 11[/link].[br][br]To arrive at the out-resurrection indicates that our entire being has been gradually and continually resurrected. God first resurrected our deadened spirit ([link]Eph. 2:5-6[/link]); then from our spirit He proceeds to resurrect our soul ([link]Rom. 8:6[/link]) and our mortal body ([link]Rom. 8:11[/link]), until our entire being &amp;#8212; spirit, soul, and body &amp;#8212; is fully resurrected out of our old being by and with His life. This is a process in life through which we must pass and a race that we must run until we arrive at the out-resurrection as the prize. Hence, the out-resurrection should be the goal and destination of our Christian life. We can reach this goal only by being conformed to the death of Christ, by living a crucified life. In the death of Christ we are processed in resurrection from the old creation to the new.</note>
