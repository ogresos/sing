        <note num="1">In the initial stage of the life of a believer, faith comes first, and then, out of faith, love is produced ([link]Gal. 5:6[/link]; [link]Eph. 1:15[/link]; [link]Col. 1:4[/link]; see notes [link]14[sup]2[/sup] in 1 Tim. 1[/link] and [link]23[sup]2[/sup] in Eph. 6[/link]). But here love is mentioned first and then faith, because the matter of the equal status of the believers, dealt with in this Epistle, is a matter of love, which comes out of faith. In the new man the members love one another in faith ([link]Titus 3:15[/link]). Their relationship is of love through faith. The apostle appreciated the fellowship of Philemon's faith ([link]v. 6[/link]) and was encouraged by his love ([link]v. 7[/link]); thus, he entreated Philemon to receive Onesimus because of this love ([link]v. 9[/link]). These two virtues are referred to in combination here; Philemon had both of them, not only toward the Lord but also to all the saints.</note>

The apostle prayed that the fellowship, the communication, the sharing of Philemon's faith toward all the saints might become effective in them in the element and sphere of the full knowledge, the full realization, of all the good things in us for Christ, causing them to acknowledge, appreciate, and recognize all the spiritual and divinely good things that are in the believers for Christ.</note>

        <note num="1">This short Epistle serves the special purpose of showing us the equality, in God's eternal life and divine love, of all the members in the Body of Christ. In the semisavage age of Paul, the life of Christ had annulled, among the believers, the strong institution of slavery. Since the sentiment of the love of the Christian fellowship was so powerful and prevailing that the evil social order among fallen mankind was spontaneously ignored, any need for institutional emancipation was obviated. Because of the divine birth and because they were living by the divine life, all the believers in Christ had equal status in the church, which was the new man in Christ and in which there was no discrimination between free and bond ([link]Col. 3:10-11[/link]). This was based on three facts: (1) Christ's death on the cross abolished the ordinances of the different ways of life, for the creating of the one new man ([link]Eph. 2:15[/link]); (2) we all were baptized into Christ and were made one in Him without any differences ([link]Gal. 3:27-28[/link]); and (3) in the new man Christ is all and in all ([link]Col. 3:11[/link]). Such a life with such a love in equal fellowship is well able to maintain good order in the church (in Titus), carry out God's economy concerning the church (in 1 Timothy), and stand against the tide of the church's decline (in 2 Timothy). It is of the Lord's sovereignty that in the arrangement of the New Testament this Epistle was positioned after the three preceding books.</note>
        <note num="2">Or, more than a slave. Onesimus was even more than a free man &amp;#8212; he was a beloved brother.</note>
        <note num="3">[i]A beloved brother[/i] here, [i]the sister[/i] ([link]v. 2[/link]), [i]our beloved and fellow worker[/i] ([link]v. 1[/link]), [i]our fellow soldier[/i] ([link]v. 2[/link]), [i]my fellow workers[/i] ([link]v. 24[/link]), [i]my fellow prisoner[/i] ([link]v. 23[/link]), and [i]a partner[/i] ([link]v. 17[/link]) are all intimate terms, indicating the apostle's intimate sentiment concerning his relationship with the members in the new man.</note>
        <note num="4">I.e., in the flesh as a slave and in the Lord as a brother. In the flesh Onesimus was a brother as a slave, and in the Lord he was a slave as a brother.</note>

        <note num="1">The apostle always greeted the recipients of his Epistles, in both the opening and the conclusion, with the grace of the Lord. This shows that he trusted in the Lord's grace, being confident that this grace would enable them, as well as himself ([link]1 Cor. 15:10[/link]), to accomplish what he wrote to them. No human effort avails for the accomplishing of a revelation as high as the completing revelation of the apostle Paul &amp;#8212; for this the Lord's grace is needed.</note>
