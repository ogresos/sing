        <note num="1">The early church recognized Luke as the author of both this Gospel and the Acts. Luke's authorship is evident from the style of composition of the two books. Luke was a Gentile ([link]Col. 4:14[/link]; cf. [link]Col. 4:11[/link]), probably an Asiatic Greek, and a physician ([link]Col. 4:14[/link]). Beginning in Troas, he joined Paul in his ministry and accompanied him in his last three ministry journeys ([link]Acts 16:10-17[/link]; [link]20:5-21:18[/link]; [link]27:1-28:15[/link]). He was a faithful companion of Paul until Paul's martyrdom ([link]Philem. 24[/link]; [link]2 Tim. 4:11[/link]). Hence, his Gospel should represent Paul's views, as Mark's represents Peter's (see note [link]1[sup]1[/sup], par. 1, in Mark 1[/link]).[br][br]The Gospels of Luke, Matthew, and Mark are synoptic in regard to the Savior's humanity (see note [link]1[sup]1[/sup], par. 2, in Mark 1[/link]). Luke's Gospel reveals God among men in His saving grace given to fallen mankind. Its purpose is to present the Savior as a genuine, normal, and perfect man. It gives a complete genealogy of the man Jesus, from His parents back to Adam, the first generation of mankind, and shows that He is a genuine descendant of man &amp;#8212; a son of man (see note [link]1[sup]1[/sup][/link], pars. 2 and 3, in [link]Matt. 1[/link]). Its record of the life of this man impresses us with the completeness and perfection of His humanity. Hence, this Gospel stresses the Lord as the Man-Savior. Based on the moral principles that apply to all men, it presents gospel messages, as in [link]4:16-21[/link]; [link]7:41-43[/link]; [link]12:14-21[/link]; and [link]13:2-5[/link]; gospel parables, as in [link]10:30-37[/link]; [link]14:16-24[/link]; [link]15:3-32[/link]; and [link]18:9-14[/link]; and gospel cases, as in [link]7:36-50[/link]; [link]13:10-17[/link]; [link]16:19-31[/link]; [link]19:1-10[/link]; and [link]23:39-43[/link]. None of these are recorded in the other Gospels. In contrast to Matthew, Luke does not stress the dispensational aspect or the Jewish background. It is the Gospel written to mankind in general, and it announces the good news to all people ([link]2:10[/link]). Its characteristic is absolutely not Jewish but Gentile ([link]4:25-28[/link]). It is a Gospel to all sinners, both Jewish and Gentile. As such, the sequence of its record is according to morality, not according to historical events. See notes [link]16[sup]1[/sup], par. 2, in Matt. 8[/link] and [link]20[sup]1[/sup] in Mark 14[/link].</note>

Here it means to be right, i.e., blameless, in the sight of God according to the Old Testament commandments and ordinances ([link]2:25[/link]; [link]Phil. 3:6[/link]). It does not mean that these righteous ones were not sinful, without sin and sins. They were blameless, but not without blemish. They still needed the unblemished sin and trespass offerings in type ([link]Lev. 4:28[/link]; [link]5:15[/link]) for their expiation that they might have contact with God.</note>

        <note num="4">The Old Testament law is generally called "the law"; its contents are divided into three categories: commandments, statutes, and ordinances. Commandments, as God's basic commands, are the general principles of the law. There are ten commandments ([link]Exo. 20:2-17[/link]). Statutes, or laws, regulations, set forth, explain in detail, and supplement the commandments, as recorded in [link]Exo. 20:22-26[/link]. Ordinances, like statutes, set forth, explain in detail, and supplement the commandments, and, in addition, include verdicts, as recorded in [link]Exo. 21:1-23:19[/link].

It was at this time, for the initiation of the gospel of God, to prepare the way for the Savior's coming and to prepare a human body for Him, that this divine title of God's Spirit was used. The preparing of the way for the Savior's coming required that His forerunner be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother's womb, so that he could separate the people unto God from all things other than God, making them holy unto Him for His purpose. The preparing of a human body for the Savior required that the Holy Spirit impart the divine nature into humanity, making man holy for the carrying out of God's plan of redemption.</note>

        <note num="2">Like the overshadowing of the cloud on the Mount of Transfiguration ([link]Matt. 17:5[/link]) and over the tabernacle ([link]Exo. 40:34[/link], [link]38[/link]). According to this verse, it seems that the Holy Spirit would be only upon Mary as the power for her to conceive the holy child. However, [link]Matt. 1:18[/link] and [link]20[/link] tell us that Mary "was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit," and that "that which has been begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit." This indicates that the divine essence out of the Holy Spirit had been begotten in Mary's womb before she delivered the child Jesus. Such a conception of the Holy Spirit in the human virgin, accomplished with the divine and human essences, constituted a mingling of the divine nature with the human nature, which produced a God-man, One who is both the complete God and the perfect man, possessing the divine nature and the human nature distinctly, without a third nature being produced. This is the most wonderful and most excellent person of Jesus, who is Jehovah the Savior.[br][br]The conception of John the Baptist was strikingly different in essence from that of Jesus the Savior. The conception of the Baptist was God's miracle, accomplished with the overage human essence, merely by the divine power without the involvement of the divine essence. This resulted in the bringing forth of a mere man who was filled with the Spirit of God ([link]v. 15[/link]) but who lacked the nature of God. The conception of the Savior was God's incarnation ([link]John 1:14[/link]), constituted not only by the divine power but also of the divine essence added to the human essence, thus producing the God-man of two natures &amp;#8212; divinity and humanity. Through this, God joined Himself to humanity that He might be manifested in the flesh ([link]1 Tim. 3:16[/link]) and might be a Man-Savior ([link]2:11[/link]).</note>
        <note num="3">As the conception was of the Holy Spirit, so what was born of that conception was a holy thing, intrinsically holy. This was Jesus our Savior.</note>

        <note num="1">Mary's poetic praise was composed of many quotations from the Old Testament, indicating that she was a godly woman qualified to be a channel for the Savior's incarnation, and that Jesus would grow up in a family that was filled with the knowledge and love of God's holy Word.</note>
        <note num="2">Mary's praise magnified the Lord based on her experience of God as her Savior through His everlasting mercy ([link]vv. 47-50[/link]) and on her observation of others' experience of God's merciful and faithful doings ([link]vv. 51-55[/link]). In content and standard, her praise was like some of the Old Testament psalms. However, she did not say anything concerning Christ, unlike Elizabeth in her blessing ([link]vv. 41-43[/link]) and Zachariah in his prophecy ([link]vv. 67-71[/link], [link]76-79[/link]) spoken through the Holy Spirit.</note>

        <note num="1">First, Mary's spirit exulted in God; then her soul magnified the Lord. Her praise to God issued from her spirit and was expressed through her soul. Her spirit was filled with joy in God her Savior, and her soul manifested that joy for the magnifying of the Lord. She lived and acted in her spirit, which directed her soul. Her spirit's exulting in God was due to her enjoyment of God as her Savior, and her soul's magnifying of the Lord was due to her exalting of the Lord, who is Jehovah, the great To Be.</note>

After the narration of the conception of the Man-Savior, Luke gives us in this chapter an excellent record of (1) His genuine human birth, which was according to the law of God's creation of man, that He might be a Man-Savior for the salvation of man; (2) His physical circumcision, carried out according to the law of God's ordination ([link]vv. 21-24[/link]), that He might be the legal seed of Abraham ([link]Gen. 17:9-14[/link]), the One in whom God's promise to Abraham &amp;#8212; "In you all the families of the earth will be blessed" ([link]Gen. 12:3[/link]) &amp;#8212; as the gospel announced to him ([link]Gal. 3:8[/link]), could be fulfilled for all the Gentiles ([link]Gal. 3:14[/link]); (3) His physical growth, which was according to the law of human life ([link]v. 40[/link]), that He might be a perfect man to express God for the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan; and (4) His proper boyhood, during which He grew in His interest concerning the things of God, which interest was related to His deity as the Son of God the Father ([link]vv. 40-52[/link]), that He might have the full measure of wisdom, stature, and favor with God and men.[br][br]The record here concerning the Savior's birth and youth is very different from that in [link]Matt. 2[/link]. What Matthew recorded of events that occurred at the Savior's birth and during His youth constitutes striking evidence of Christ's legitimate kingship. Luke also recorded the Savior's birth and youth, but what he recorded were events of a different category, events that offer strong proof of Jesus' genuine humanity. The two records cover only two of the different aspects of the Savior's wonderful status. See note [link]2[sup]1[/sup] in Matt. 2[/link].</note>

It was in such an economical way that God forsook and left Jesus while He was carrying the sinners' sin in dying for them on the cross ([link]Matt. 27:46[/link]). The Holy Spirit in power descended upon Him here, but He had the Holy Spirit in essence from His birth; and while the Holy Spirit in power was descending upon Him, He was existing with the Holy Spirit in essence.</note>

        <text>And the devil said to Him, To You I will give all this [xref]a[/xref]authority and their glory, because to me it [note]1[/note]has been delivered, and to whomever I want I give it.</text>
        <note num="1">This must have occurred in the preadamic age. The devil's word here indicates that when God anointed the archangel to be the head of the preadamic age ([link]Ezek. 28:13-14[/link]), the authority and glory of the kingdom of the earth must have been given to him. The Lord's word in [link]John 12:31[/link] confirms this. After he rebelled against God and became God's enemy, Satan, he was judged by God ([link]Isa. 14:12-15[/link]), but the full execution of God's judgment upon him will not be completed until the end of the millennium ([link]Rev. 20:7-10[/link]). Hence, until that time he has authority over the kingdoms of the earth. He tempted the Lord Jesus by offering this authority and its glory to Him. His evil offer was rejected by God's Christ, but it will be accepted by the Antichrist, the man of lawlessness ([link]2 Thes. 2:3-4[/link]), at the end of this age ([link]Rev. 13:4[/link]) for the executing of Satan's evil strategy against God. Only by Christ, who lives in us, can we reject the evil tempter.</note>

        <note num="1">The Greek word means [i]to announce good news, to declare (bring) glad tidings, to preach (the gospel).[/i] Hence, to announce the gospel of the kingdom of God is to preach the kingdom of God as the gospel, the good news.</note>
        <note num="2">The kingdom of God is the Savior (see note [link]21[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 17[/link]) as the seed of life sown into His believers, God's chosen people ([link]Mark 4:3[/link], [link]26[/link]), and developing into a realm over which God can rule as His kingdom in His divine life. The entrance into the kingdom is regeneration ([link]John 3:5[/link]), and the development of the kingdom is the believers' growth in the divine life ([link]2 Pet. 1:3-11[/link]). The kingdom is the church life today, in which the faithful believers live ([link]Rom. 14:17[/link]), and it will develop into the coming kingdom as a reward to be inherited ([link]Gal. 5:21[/link]; [link]Eph. 5:5[/link]) by the overcoming saints in the millennium ([link]Rev. 20:4[/link], [link]6[/link]). Eventually, it will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the eternal kingdom of God, an eternal realm of the eternal blessing of God's eternal life, which all God's redeemed will enjoy in the new heaven and new earth for eternity &amp;#8212; [link]Rev. 21:1-4[/link]; [link]22:1-5[/link], [link]14[/link] (see notes [link]15[sup]1[/sup] in Mark 1[/link], and [link chapter="4"]3[sup]1[/sup][/link], [link]3[sup]2[/sup][/link], [link]26[sup]1[/sup][/link], [link]26[sup]3[/sup] in Mark 4[/link]).

Faith, love, and peace are three crucial virtues in experiencing and enjoying the Savior's salvation. Faith is brought forth by knowing the Savior in His saving power and virtue. Love comes out of this faith and brings in peace; then we follow the Savior.

        <note num="1">The Lord sent the disciples to preach the gospel by going to every city and place and visiting people in their homes. This may serve to confirm our preaching of the gospel today by knocking on doors and visiting people from door to door. The Lord sent the disciples as lambs entering into the midst of wolves ([link]v. 3[/link]). However, among the wolves there were sons of peace, that is, sheep that the Lord was concerned about ([link]Matt. 9:36[/link]) and the harvest that He desired to reap ([link]v. 2[/link]; [link]Matt. 9:37-38[/link]). Because these sheep and the harvest, both of which belonged to the Lord, were scattered and mixed with the wolves, it was necessary for the Lord's disciples to go into the midst of the wolves to seek them out house by house and to reap them. It is the same today. Preaching the gospel by going out to every place to visit people in their homes is ordained by God. It is absolutely different from today's religious way of holding large gatherings to carry out gospel campaigns.</note>

The parable shows the compassion and love of the Savior, who is a man and becomes the sinners' neighbor; the story of Martha and Mary unveils the desire and preference of the Lord, who is God and becomes the believers' Master. The Savior gives us His compassion and love so that we can be saved by Him; the Lord expresses His desire and preference so that we can serve Him. After receiving salvation from the Savior, we should render service to the Lord. For our salvation we need to realize the Savior's compassion and love; for our service we need to know the Lord's desire and preference.</note>

[link]Matt. 21:33[/link] and note 1). He had been seeking fruit for three years ([link]v. 7[/link]) but had not found any. He wanted to cut the Jews down, but God the Son as the vinedresser prayed for them, asking God the Father to tolerate them until the Son died for them (dug the ground around the fig tree) and gave them fertilizer (threw on manure), at which point, He hoped, they would repent and produce fruit. Otherwise, they would be cut down.

        <note num="1">This great dinner is different from the wedding feast in [link]Matt. 22:2-14[/link], which was for the reward of the kingdom. This great dinner is for God's full salvation. God, as the "certain man," prepared His full salvation as a great dinner and sent the first apostles as His slaves to invite the Jews ([link]vv. 16-17[/link]). But because they were occupied by their riches, such as land, cattle, or a wife, they refused His invitation ([link]vv. 18-20[/link]). Then God sent the apostles to invite the people on the streets &amp;#8212; the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame. Because of their poverty and misery, they accepted God's invitation ([link]vv. 21-22a[/link]). Yet God's salvation still had room for more; so He sent His slaves to go out farther, to the Gentile world, signified by the roads and hedges, to compel the Gentiles to come in and fill up the house of His salvation ([link]vv. 22b-23[/link]; [link]Acts 13:46-48[/link]; [link]Rom. 11:25[/link]).</note>

The Son came in His humanity as the Shepherd to find the sinner as a lost sheep and bring him back home ([link]vv. 4-7[/link]). The Spirit seeks the sinner as a woman carefully seeks a lost coin until she finds it ([link]vv. 8-10[/link]). And the Father receives the repenting and returned sinner as the "certain man" here receives his prodigal son ([link]vv. 11-32[/link]). The entire Divine Trinity treasures the sinner and participates in bringing him back to God. All three parables stress the love of the Divine Trinity more than the fallen condition and repentance of the penitent sinner. The divine love is fully expressed in the Son's tender care as the good shepherd, in the Spirit's fine seeking as the treasure-lover, and in the Father's warm receiving as a loving father.</note>

While God does supply the believers with their daily necessities from the material things of this age ([link]Matt. 6:31-33[/link]) and commits to them as His stewards a portion of these material goods for their exercise and learning that He might prove them in this age, none of these goods should be considered theirs until the restitution of all things in the next age ([link]Acts 3:21[/link]). Not until then will the believers inherit the world ([link]Rom. 4:13[/link]) and have an abiding possession ([link]Heb. 10:34[/link]) for themselves. In this age they should exercise to be faithful in the temporary material things God has given them that they may learn to be faithful toward their eternal possession in the coming age.</note>

        <note num="1">This means that the Savior healed the blind man before He entered Jericho. But according to [link]Matt. 20:29[/link] and [link]Mark 10:46[/link], the healing occurred at His going out from Jericho. Luke's narrative has a spiritual significance. The blind man's receiving of sight was followed in [link book="Luke"]19:1-9[/link] by the salvation of Zaccheus. This indicates that to receive salvation one must first have sight to see the Savior. These two cases, occurring at Jericho one after the other, should be considered, spiritually, as one complete case. A sinner in darkness needs to receive sight that he may realize that he needs salvation ([link]Acts 26:18[/link]).[br][br]What is covered in [link]18:35-19:10[/link] shows how one can fulfill the conditions revealed in [link]vv. 9-30[/link] for entering the kingdom of God &amp;#8212; first, one must receive sight from the Savior ([link]vv. 35-43[/link]), and then one must receive the Savior as the dynamic salvation ([link]19:1-10[/link]). In this way the blind man could be like the repenting tax collector and the unoccupied little child and receive the Savior, and Zaccheus could renounce all his riches and follow Him. The way to enter into all spiritual things is to receive sight from the Lord and to receive the Lord Himself.</note>
