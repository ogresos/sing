        <text>[note]1[/note]How the city sits alone / That was full of people! / She who was [i]once[/i] great among the nations / Has become like a widow; / She who was a princess among the provinces / Has become tributary.</text>
        <note num="1">This book, written by Jeremiah, the weeping and lamenting prophet ([link]2:11[/link]; [link]3:48[/link]; [link]Jer. 9:1[/link]), contains five lamentations expressing Jeremiah's sorrow and love for the holy city and the holy people of God. Jeremiah had prophesied concerning Israel's destruction carried out under God's governmental dealing, and he had also witnessed the destruction, devastation, contamination, capture, and ruin of the entire country, including Jerusalem. By God's sovereignty Jeremiah was free from captivity ([link]Jer. 40:1-6[/link]). According to history Jeremiah sat on a hill overlooking Jerusalem, viewing all the ruins below. He began to weep, and he could not avoid writing down his feelings.[br/][br/]Jeremiah wrote his five lamentations in a very fine way. In Hebrew the first letter of each verse of [link]chs. 1[/link], [link book="Lam."]2[/link], and [link book="Lam."]4[/link] follows the order of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. In [link]ch. 3[/link] every three verses form a group that begins with the same Hebrew letter, and the twenty-two groups formed follow the order of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet.</note>

        <note num="1">This indicates that Jeremiah contacted the Lord as the compassionate One every morning. It was through his contact with the Lord that he received this word regarding God's lovingkindness, compassions, and faithfulness.</note>
        <note num="2">God's compassions do not fail, because He is the faithful One. The faithfulness of God refers to His word and is also related to His covenant. Because He had made a covenant with Abraham and confirmed it with Isaac and Jacob ([link]Gen. 15:1-21[/link]; [link]17:1-22[/link]; [link]26:1-4[/link]; [link]35:11-12[/link]), God had to be faithful to keep His word.</note>

        <text>Jehovah is my [note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]portion, says my soul; / Therefore I hope in Him.</text>
        <note num="1">This word concerning Jehovah being our portion and our hoping in Him bears a New Testament flavor ([link]Col. 1:12[/link], [link]27[/link]). Jeremiah enjoyed Jehovah as his portion, and he put his hope not in himself nor in the people nor in anything else but only in Jehovah. On the one hand, Jeremiah realized that God is a God of lovingkindness, that He is compassionate, and that His word is faithful ([link]vv. 22-23[/link]). On the other hand, Jeremiah realized that we still need to contact the Lord every morning, put our entire hope in Him, wait on Him, and call on His name ([link]vv. 23-25[/link], [link]55[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">Although God is true, living, compassionate, and faithful, in order to test His people, He often delays in fulfilling His word. In Jeremiah's case, the waiting on the Lord has been quite long. The fulfillment of his prophecies concerning the age of restoration has still not come. This indicates that we need to learn the lesson of waiting on the Lord. Today is not the time of the ultimate consummation; therefore, we must wait on the Lord.</note>

He refers here to God's eternal being and His eternal and unchanging government. Jerusalem was overthrown, the temple was burned down, and God's people were carried away, but Jehovah, the Lord of the universe, remains to exercise His administration.[br/][br/]God's eternal being and His throne are higher than His lovingkindness, compassions, and faithfulness ([link]3:22-23[/link]). God's lovingkindness and compassions can fluctuate, but God's person and His government remain unchanging forever. In the New Jerusalem, God will be fully unveiled in His person as the eternal King and in His government as His eternal, unshakable kingdom ([link]Heb. 12:28[/link]; [link]Rev. 22:3[/link]), both of which are the unshakable foundation of His dealing with His people.</note>

        <note num="1">This word, expressed as an imperative, indicates that Jeremiah considered that the responsibility for the turning of the children of Israel depended upon Jehovah. Although Jeremiah wrote here in a human way, his thought was correct. At the time of the Lord's second coming, the Lord will turn to Israel and appear to them, and they will turn to Him and receive His household salvation ([link]Zech. 12:10[/link]; [link]Rom. 11:26[/link]; [link]Rev. 1:7[/link]).</note>

        <text>Or have You [note]1[/note]utterly rejected us? / Are You [note]1[/note]exceedingly angry with us?</text>
        <note num="1">Jehovah had not utterly rejected Israel, nor was He exceedingly angry with them. But Israel needed to wait on Him until the time of restoration ([link]Matt. 19:28[/link]; [link]Acts 3:21[/link]), when He will restore the children of Israel to be in His person and in His eternal kingdom to enjoy what He had promised to their forefathers. See note [link]25[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 3[/link].[br/][br/]In [link chapter="5"]vv. 20-22[/link] Jeremiah speaks to Jehovah a challenging word, even a commanding and reproving word. However, Jehovah did not answer him but remained silent. All Jeremiah's challenges and questions are answered in the following books of the Bible. The consummation of this answer will be the New Jerusalem. Hence, Jeremiah must wait until the New Testament age, until the age of the millennial kingdom, and until the New Jerusalem. Then he will be fully satisfied.</note>
