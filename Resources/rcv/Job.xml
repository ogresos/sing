    <info title="Author">Job.</info>
    <info title="Time of Writing">According to the way of Job's nomadic living ([link]1:3[/link]) and the way he offered the burnt offering for his children, it seems that this book was written at the time of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob ([link]v. 5[/link]; [link]Gen. 22:13[/link]; [link]31:54[/link]), about 2000 B.C., five hundred years before Moses wrote the Pentateuch.</info>
    <info title="Place of Writing">The land of Uz ([link]1:1[/link]), an area associated with Edom ([link]Lam. 4:21[/link]), west of the Arabian desert.</info>
    <info title="Time Period Covered">The period of time that this book covers cannot be determined with accuracy; however, after his trials Job lived another 140 years ([link]42:16[/link]), making the period of this book close to two hundred years, somewhere around 2000 B.C.</info>

        <text>[note]1[/note]There was a man in the land of [note]2[/note]Uz whose name was [note]3[/note][xref]a[/xref]Job; and this man was [note]4[/note][xref]b[/xref]perfect and upright, and he feared God and turned away from evil.</text>
        <note num="1">Job is a book of the debates of godly men concerning the purpose of the sufferings of the saints, that is, the purpose of God's dealing with His people. The book is poetic in form, with the exception of [link]chs. 1[/link] and [link]2[/link] and the last eleven verses of [link]ch. 42[/link]. Job is the first of the five books of poetry in the Scriptures, the other four being Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs.[br/][br/]The book of Job, written early in the progression of the divine revelation (see note [link]13[sup]1[/sup], par. 2, in ch. 2[/link]), does not contain a clear revelation of God's purpose in dealing with His people. This revelation was given not to Job but to Paul. As unveiled in Paul's Epistles, God's purpose in dealing with us is to strip us of all things and to consume us so that we may gain God more and more ([link]Phil. 3:8[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 4:16[/link]). Cf. note [link]2[sup]1[/sup] in Gen. 42[/link] and note [link]26[sup]1[/sup] in Psa. 73[/link].</note>
        <note num="2">A city in Edom ([link]Lam. 4:21[/link]).</note>
        <note num="3">The name means [i]hated,[/i] or [i]persecuted.[/i] It corresponds to the hatred and persecution that Job suffered from Satan, the enemy of God.</note>
        <note num="4">Being perfect is related to the inner man, and being upright is related to the outer man. In addition to being perfect inwardly and upright outwardly, Job feared God positively and turned away from evil negatively. However, God did not create man merely to fear Him and not do anything wrong. Rather, God created man in His own image and according to His likeness that man may express God ([link]Gen. 1:26[/link] and notes). To express God is higher than fearing God and turning away from evil.[br/][br/]Job was also a man of integrity ([link]2:3[/link], [link]9[/link]; [link]27:5[/link]; [link]31:6[/link]). Integrity is the totality of being perfect and being upright. With respect to Job, integrity is the total expression of what he was. In character he was perfect and upright, and in his ethics he had a high standard of integrity.</note>

        <text>And when the days of feasting ran their course, Job would send [i]word[/i] and [note]1[/note]sanctify them; and he would rise early in the morning and offer [note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]burnt offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said, Perhaps my children have sinned and have [note]2[/note]cursed God in their heart. Job did this continually.</text>
        <note num="1">Because feasting, an excess in eating, can be worldly, Job, a godly father, sanctified his children after their days of feasting. He offered burnt offerings for them continually.</note>

        <text>Then one day, when the [note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]sons of God came to present themselves [xref]b[/xref]before Jehovah, [note]2[/note][xref]c[/xref]Satan also came [note]3[/note]among them.</text>
        <note num="1">The sons of God are the angels (cf. [link]1 Kings 22:19-23[/link]; [link]Psa. 89:5-7[/link]). The scene in [link]vv. 6-8[/link] depicts one of the two councils held in heaven concerning Job. What Job had attained in his perfection, uprightness, and integrity was altogether vanity. It neither fulfilled God's purpose nor satisfied God's desire. Thus, God was lovingly concerned for Job and held two councils in heaven concerning how to deal with Job ([link]vv. 6-8[/link]; [link]2:1-3[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">Lit., the [i]satan,[/i] the adversary. So also through [link]2:7[/link]. See note [link]10[sup]1[/sup] in Matt. 4[/link].</note>
        <note num="3">After he rebelled against God, Satan was condemned and even sentenced by God (see notes in [link]Isa. 14:12-15[/link] and [link]Ezek. 28:12-19[/link]). Yet in His wisdom and sovereignty God did not execute His judgment on Satan. God still has given Satan a certain limited time to do something to meet some negative need in the fulfillment of His economy. God could not and would not ask any of His many excellent angels to do what was needed to damage Job in order to strip him of everything so that he might be full of God. Satan was the unique one in the universe who could and who would fulfill God's intention of stripping Job of his possessions and his ethical attainment. Thus, the scene here and in [link]ch. 2[/link] shows that Satan remains free to be purposely used by God as an ugly tool to execute God's severe dealing with his loving ones.[br/][br/]Two thousand years after the time of Job, Jesus Christ destroyed Satan through His death on the cross ([link]Heb. 2:14[/link]). However, Satan's right to enter into the presence of God still has not been taken away from him (cf. [link]Rev. 12:10[/link]). This right will be taken away at the beginning of the great tribulation. When the overcomers are raptured to God's throne, Satan will be cast down from the heavens to the earth ([link]Rev. 12:5[/link], [link]7-9[/link]). From that time onward, Satan will no longer have the right to enter into the presence of God.</note>

        <note num="1">Only God knew that Job had a need &amp;#8212; he did not have God within him. God's boasting to Satan regarding Job's perfection and uprightness ([link]v. 8[/link]; [link]2:3[/link]) was with the intention that Satan would do something for God to meet Job's need. Satan, an evil angel, was willing to do what none of the good angels were willing to do, and he immediately accepted the dishonorable commission ([link]v. 12[/link]; [link]2:6[/link]).

        <note num="1">Satan's evil concept concerning God's dealing with His seeking people is based on his commercial principle of gain or loss. Satan is a businessman, a merchant ([link]Ezek. 28:16[/link], [link]18[/link]; cf. [link]Rev. 18:11-19[/link]), and his thought is according to his commercial principle. He does not recognize that God's purpose in dealing with those who love Him is that they may gain Him to the fullest extent, surpassing the loss of all that they have other than Him ([link]Phil. 3:7-8[/link]), that He might be expressed through them for the fulfillment of His purpose in creating man ([link]Gen. 1:26[/link]).</note>

        <text>And Jehovah said to Satan, Here is all that he has, in your hand; [note]1[/note]only do not stretch forth your hand against him.[separator]And Satan went forth from Jehovah's presence.</text>
        <note num="1">As seen in the experiences of both Job and Paul, God assigns certain afflictions to His chosen ones for their perfecting. Although these afflictions are God's assignment, they do not come from God but from Satan (cf. [link]2 Cor. 12:7-9[/link]). Satan, in his cruel nature, would attack God's lovers to any extent to damage them if God did not draw a line to preserve His lovers' existence that they might gain Him to the fullest extent for His fullest satisfaction. After God judged Satan, God still allowed him to be free to accuse, attack, damage, persecute, and martyr His saints that God may use him to a certain extent for the fulfillment of His particular purpose ([link]2 Cor. 4:16-17[/link]). However, God always restricts him in the limit of His permission (cf. [link]1 Cor. 10:13[/link]).[br/][br/]Satan's attacks on Job in two steps ([link]vv. 13-19[/link]; [link]2:7[/link]) laid a foundation for God to accomplish His glorious transformation on Job, and for Job to experience the mysterious transactions in his relationship with the mysterious God.</note>

        <note num="1">Job's three friends could not speak anything because they had no knowledge, no understanding, concerning the purpose of what had happened to Job. The scene here indicates that Job and his friends were ignorant concerning that most painful and most terrifying occurrence, and were puzzled in their godliness, unable to discern what the reason was, what the purpose was, and what the result would be. Actually, Job's experience was a step taken by God in His divine economy to carry out the consuming and stripping of the contented Job in order to usher Job into a deeper seeking after God, that he might gain God instead of His blessings and his attainments in his perfection and integrity. God's stripping and consuming were exercised over Job to tear Job down that God might have a base and a way to rebuild him with God Himself that he might become a God-man, the same as God in His life and nature but not in His Godhead, in order to express God.[br/][br/]The divine revelation in the Bible is progressive. Up to Job's time the progression of the divine revelation had reached only the level of Abraham's time, that is, that sinners need God's redemption with the shedding of the blood of the burnt offering ([link]1:5[/link]; [link]42:8[/link]). The divine truths regarding such matters as regeneration ([link]John 3:6[/link]; [link]1 Pet. 1:23[/link]), renewing ([link]2 Cor. 4:16[/link]; [link]Eph. 4:23[/link]), transformation ([link]Rom. 12:2[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 3:18[/link]), conformation ([link]Rom. 8:29[/link]), and glorification ([link]Rom. 8:23[/link], [link]30[/link]; [link]Phil. 3:21[/link]) were not explicitly revealed to man in God's Old Testament economy. God could not speak such things to Job and his friends because they were in a primitive stage of the divine revelation (cf. [link]John 3:7-12[/link]; [link]16:12-13[/link]). These things were not revealed in completion until the apostle Paul's time. Paul received a full and explicit revelation of things concerning which Job and his friends had no understanding ([link]Eph. 3:3-6[/link], [link]9-11[/link]; [link]Col. 1:25-27[/link]). Without the Epistles of Paul it would be difficult to understand the book of Job, because the conclusion of Job does not give us an explicit view concerning the purpose of God's dealing with His people. However, in the view of the New Testament it is very clear that God's purpose in dealing with His holy people is that they would be emptied of everything and receive only God as their gain ([link]Phil. 3:8[/link]; cf. [link]Psa. 73:25-26[/link]). The desire of God's heart is that we would gain Him in full as life, as the life supply, and as everything to our being.</note>

        <text>After this Job opened his mouth and [note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]cursed the day of his [i]birth.[/i]</text>
        <note num="1">Job was disturbed, perplexed, and entangled to the uttermost by his suffering of the disasters that befell his possessions and his children and the plague on his body, in spite of his perfection, uprightness, and integrity. When Job cursed the day of his birth, equivalent to cursing his mother, he surely was not perfect and upright, nor did he hold his integrity. Rather, he became bankrupt in integrity.[br/][br/]God's intention with Job was to consume him and to strip him of his attainments, his achievements, in the highest standard of ethics in perfection and uprightness ([link]1:1[/link]). God's intention was also to tear down the natural Job in his perfection and uprightness that He might build up a renewed Job in God's nature and attributes. God's intention was not to have a Job in the line of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil but a Job in the line of the tree of life ([link]Gen. 2:9[/link]). Eventually, God's intention was to make Job a man of God ([link]1 Tim. 6:11[/link]; [link]2 Tim. 3:17[/link]), filled with Christ, the embodiment of God, to be the fullness of God for the expression of God in Christ ([link]Eph. 3:14-21[/link]). Such a man of God, constituted with God according to His economy, would never be entangled by any troubles and problems so that he would curse his birth and prefer to die rather than to live.

        <note num="1">Job's experience of God's consuming and stripping in the Old Testament was far behind that of Paul in the New Testament. First, God stripped Job of his possessions ([link]1:13-19[/link]), and then God consumed him by his suffering of the plague on his body ([link]2:7[/link]). In the New Testament God's consuming and stripping become pleasant things. From the day he was converted, Paul was a person under God's consuming and God's stripping ([link]2 Cor. 4:8-18[/link]; [link]Phil. 3:7-8[/link]). However, when Paul was suffering distresses for the sake of Christ, he was well pleased ([link]2 Cor. 12:10[/link]), and he even rejoiced in the Lord for his experiences ([link]Col. 1:24[/link]; [link]Phil. 4:4[/link]). In contrast, Job did not rejoice but was constantly vexed.[br/][br/]In his experience of God's consuming and stripping, Paul was not constricted by the pressures on every side and did not perish despite his being cast down ([link]2 Cor. 4:8-9[/link]). He did not lose heart, but he expected to be put to death that he might manifest Christ's life, and to be consumed day by day that he might be renewed and, through the momentary lightness of his affliction, add to the eternal weight of glory that he would share in the ages to come ([link]2 Cor. 4:10-12[/link], [link]16-17[/link]; cf. [link]Rom. 8:18[/link]). Unlike Job, Paul did not curse the day of his birth, and he did not say that he preferred to die rather than to live. On the contrary, after much consideration Paul said that he still preferred to live, not to die, because to him to live was Christ ([link]Phil. 1:21-25[/link]). Paul's living Christ was for him to magnify Christ, whether through life or through death, by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ ([link]Phil. 1:19-20[/link]). He did not care for life or death; he cared only to live Christ for His magnification. When God created man, this is the kind of life He wanted man to live.</note>

        <note num="1">The contents of the book of Job are the expressions of the sentiments of godly men, including Job, his three friends, and the young man Elihu, plus the speaking of God. The expressions of the sentiments of the five godly men were according to the experiences of their godly life and were based on human concepts concerning the relationship between God and man. They were uttered before the law was given, yet they were filled with the principle of good and evil. The logic of the speakers was according to the line of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil ([link]Gen. 2:9[/link]), and, based on this, they considered God's justice and righteous judgment very much. Much of their debate in this book resulted from their different views concerning God's judgment. Job's friends thought that what he was suffering was a matter of God's judgment. However, Job's sufferings were not God's judgment but God's stripping and consuming that God might gain Job so that he might gain God more. See note [link]15[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 9[/link] and note [link]13[sup]1[/sup], par. 2, in ch. 10[/link].[br/][br/]Although they contradict God's purpose for man, the words of Job, his three friends, and Elihu were recorded under the inspiration of the Spirit of God to serve God's purpose of exposing the mistake of these five godly men in their knowing of God. Thus, man may be enlightened to realize that, according to the good pleasure of God's heart's desire, man should be filled with God to be the expression of God only, rather than the expression of man's perfection in his uprightness and integrity.</note>

        <text>Then Job [note]1[/note]answered and said,</text>
        <note num="1">Job's vindication of himself in [link]chs. 6[/link] and [link book="Job"]7[/link] is an extract of the entire book. As he vindicated himself, Job stated his grievances ([link]vv. 1-7[/link]), challenged God ([link]vv. 8-13[/link]), blamed his friends ([link]vv. 14-23[/link]), justified himself ([link]vv. 24-30[/link]), expressed that he had the common knowledge of the vanity and end of human life ([link]7:1-10[/link]), and concluded by saying that he loathed life and wanted to die ([link]7:11-21[/link]). Job was challenging God and his friends to give him an answer. However, the answer to the book of Job is found not in this book but in the New Testament (see note [link]13[sup]1[/sup], par. 2, in ch. 2[/link] and note [link]17[sup]1[/sup] in ch. 42[/link]).[br/][br/]Job, like his friends, was halted in the knowledge of right and wrong, not knowing God's economy, not realizing in an adequate way the purpose for which God created man. He and his friends were devoid of the divine revelation and of the experience of the divine life. He had no idea that God had no intention to increase his perfection, uprightness, righteousness, and integrity. Rather, God's intention was to strip all these human virtues which he had as his contentment, so that he could seek and gain only God Himself. Neither his friends nor he were in the line of the tree of life as God ordained man to be ([link]Gen. 2:9[/link], [link]16-17[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">This indicates that Job could not find the reason for God's treatment of him, but he believed that there had to be some reason hidden in God's heart. Job was right; something was hidden in God's heart &amp;#8212; the mystery of the ages ([link]Eph. 3:9[/link]). After creating man in His image and according to His likeness ([link]Gen. 1:26[/link]), God kept His intention hidden throughout the ages. Before the New Testament time He did not unveil to anyone what His purpose was ([link]Eph. 3:4-5[/link]).[br/][br/]The mystery hidden in God's heart is God's eternal economy ([link]Eph. 1:10[/link]; [link]3:9[/link]; [link]1 Tim. 1:4[/link]), which is God's eternal intention with His heart's desire to dispense Himself in His Divine Trinity as the Father in the Son by the Spirit into His chosen people to be their life and nature that they may be the same as He is as His duplication ([link]Rom. 8:29[/link]; [link]1 John 3:2[/link]), to become an organism, the Body of Christ as the new man ([link]Eph. 2:15-16[/link]), for God's fullness, God's expression ([link]Eph. 1:22-23[/link]; [link]3:19[/link]), which will consummate in the New Jerusalem ([link]Rev. 21:2-22:5[/link]). Not knowing God's intention, Job misunderstood God and thought that God was angry with him and was judging him and punishing him. God's intention was not to judge Job or to punish him but to tear him down and then rebuild him with Himself, to make Job a new man in God's new creation ([link]2 Cor. 5:17[/link]; [link]Gal. 6:15[/link]). This is the answer to Job, to the book of Job, and to Job's vindication.</note>

        <note num="1">Elihu's speaking indicates that he was quite proud. Although he was full of assurance that he could answer Job adequately concerning God's purpose in dealing with Job, in all his speaking Elihu did not answer Job with a clear view like the apostle Paul's clear vision in the New Testament concerning the goal of gaining Christ in his suffering the loss of all things ([link]Phil. 3:8-14[/link]) and concerning the believers' affliction working out for them an eternal weight of glory ([link]2 Cor. 4:17[/link]). Elihu's word had nothing of the divine wisdom. With Paul, however, there was a clear word of revelation. Hence, Paul's word was truly the word of wisdom ([link]1 Cor. 12:8[/link]).[br/][br/]Furthermore, the speaking of Job, of his three friends, and of Elihu was altogether lacking in the exercise of the spirit to contact God. They spoke concerning God, and they also referred to their spirit, but in all their debates there is no hint that they were exercising their spirit. Rather, they exercised their mind to make a display of their knowledge. In this matter Elihu followed the example of the older ones and spoke in the same way. Elihu was a person who was full of the knowledge of good and evil. He was not a person in the spirit (cf. [link]Rev. 1:10[/link]).</note>

        <text>[xref]a[/xref]Then Jehovah [note]1[/note]answered Job out of the whirlwind and said,</text>
        <note num="1">In God's appearing to Job ([link]vv. 1-3[/link]; [link]40:1-14[/link]), His intention was to show Job that he was nothing and that God is unlimited, unsearchable, and untraceable. God's appearing also implied that He wanted to help Job to know that he was in the wrong realm, the realm of building up himself as a man in the old creation in his perfection, uprightness, and integrity. Job glorified himself in these things, but God considered them frustrations to be stripped away so that Job might receive God in His nature, life, element, and essence and thus be metabolically transformed to be a God-man, a man in the new creation who expresses God and dispenses Him to others.[br/][br/]God's dealing with Job in all the disasters and His stripping him of all that he was, were to take away his contentment in his godly attainments and obtainments and to remove all the barriers and coverings so that he could be emptied for some further seeking after God and could realize that what he was short of in his human life was God Himself. At the end of the book of Job, God came in to reveal Himself to Job, indicating that He Himself was what Job should pursue, gain, and express. In all God's dealings with Job, God's intention was to reduce Job to nothing, yet to maintain his existence ([link]2:6[/link]) so that He might have time to impart Himself into Job.</note>

        <note num="1">In His divine unveilings concerning the universe ([link]vv. 4-38[/link]) and concerning the animals ([link]38:39-39:30[/link]; [link]40:15-41:34[/link]), God's intention was to enable Job to see that he, a person who remained in himself, was considering things regarding the universe and God that were far beyond his capacity. Thus, God charged Job and questioned him again and again in order to humble him and silence him ([link]40:3-5[/link]).[br/][br/]In the divine unveilings to Job, nothing was revealed concerning the purpose of God in dealing with Job. Thus, the adequate knowledge of this matter is not found in this book. The revelation regarding the purpose of God's dealing with Job had to wait until Christ came and until the apostle Paul was raised up to complete the divine revelation in the Scriptures regarding the mystery in God's eternal economy, which concerns Christ as the mystery of God ([link]Col. 2:2[/link]) and the church, the Body of Christ, as the mystery of Christ ([link]Eph. 3:4-6[/link]), the main point being that Christ is within His Body as the hope of glory ([link]Col. 1:25-27[/link]).</note>
        <note num="2">When God created the earth, He created it in an orderly way ([link]Isa. 45:18[/link]), laying its foundations, measuring it out, placing it on solid bases, and laying its cornerstone ([link]vv. 4-6[/link]). The earth has foundations ([link]Zech. 12:1b[/link]), but it seemingly does not have anything supporting it (cf. [link]26:7b[/link]). Actually, all things are upheld by Christ ([link]Heb. 1:3[/link] and note 2).</note>

Then He created the stars and certain living things in the heavens, including the angels. The earth was created somewhat later. Thus, at the time when God was creating the earth, the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God (the angels &amp;#8212; [link]1:6[/link]; [link]2:1[/link]) shouted for joy because of God's beautiful building of the earth.</note>

All God's redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, transformed, conformed, and glorified people will see God's face ([link]Rev. 22:4[/link]). Seeing God transforms us ([link]2 Cor. 3:18[/link]; cf. [link]1 John 3:2[/link]), because in seeing God we receive His element into us and our old element is discharged. This metabolic process is transformation ([link]Rom. 12:2[/link]). To see God is to be transformed into the glorious image of Christ, the God-man, that we may express God in His life and represent Him in His authority.</note>

Job felt that, according to his conscience, he had not done anything that required God to judge him or to punish him. Nevertheless, he was suffering and he wanted to investigate his situation with God. Job's three friends, however, insisted that Job's sufferings were a proof that he had done something wrong and was being judged by God. Thus, God came in to condemn the three friends and to vindicate Job to a certain extent.[br/][br/]Nevertheless, Job was devoid of the divine revelation, not knowing that God's purpose in dealing with His people is that He wants His people to gain Him, to partake of Him, to possess Him, and to enjoy Him, rather than all things, until their enjoyment reaches the fullest extent ([link]Phil. 3:7-14[/link]; [link]2 Cor. 4:16-17[/link]), as the divine revelation ultimately unveils in the New Testament, that His people may ultimately become the New Jerusalem ([link]Rev. 21:2-22:5[/link]).</note>

This indicates that God is perfect and kind in dealing with those who love Him. Even today, after God deals with us by stripping us and consuming us, and after His purpose is accomplished, God gives us His physical blessings. However, God's purpose in dealing with His people is not to give physical blessings to them but to give Himself to them as their eternal portion, which ultimately consummates in the New Jerusalem. The all-embracing aggregate, the totality, of the divine blessing given by God to His people is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God ([link]Gal. 3:14[/link]).</note>

        <note num="1">The forty-two chapters in Job leave us with a crucial question of two parts: what was the purpose of God in His creation of man, and what is the purpose of God in His dealing with His chosen people? The entire Bible is needed to answer this question. In particular, the New Testament is a long answer to the question in Job. This answer is the eternal economy of God according to His good pleasure, which is to dispense Himself in His Divine Trinity &amp;#8212; in the Father, in the Son, and in the Spirit &amp;#8212; through His incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, with the outpouring of the Spirit, into His chosen and redeemed people, to make all of them the same as He is in life and in nature but not in the Godhead, to make them His duplication that they may express Him ([link]Rom. 8:28-29[/link] and notes). The issue of such a divine dispensing is the church as the Body of Christ, as the new man, and as the organism of the Triune God. This organism will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the enlarged, the increased, incarnation of God consummated in full, that is, the fullness of the Triune God ([link]Eph. 3:19[/link]) for Him to express Himself corporately in His divinity mingled with humanity for eternity. This is the divine revelation in the New Testament as the answer to the sufferings of Job and to the great question concerning God's purpose in His creation of man and in His dealing with His chosen people.</note>
