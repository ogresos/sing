        <note num="1">The apostle John, like Peter, was an elder in the church at Jerusalem before its destruction in A.D. 70 ([link]Gal. 2:9[/link], and note [link]1[sup]3[/sup] in 1 Pet. 5[/link]). According to history, after returning from his exile, John stayed in Ephesus to care for the churches in Asia. Thus, he was probably also an elder in the church at Ephesus, where he wrote this Epistle.</note>
        <note num="2">Gk. [i]kuria,[/i] the feminine form of [i]kurios,[/i] which means [i]lord, master.[/i] There are different interpretations of the word here. The most preferred is as follows: it refers to a Christian sister of some prominence in the church, as does [i]co-chosen[/i] in [link]1 Pet. 5:13[/link]. Kuria might have been her name, since it was a common name at that time. Some mention that according to history she lived near Ephesus and that her sister ([link]v. 13[/link]) lived in Ephesus, where the church was under John's care. There was a church in her locality, and it met in her home.</note>
        <note num="3">The same as the Greek word for [i]truth.[/i] According to John's usage of this word, especially in his Gospel, here it denotes the revealed divine reality &amp;#8212; the Triune God dispensed into man in the Son, Jesus Christ &amp;#8212; becoming man's genuineness and sincerity, that man may live a life that corresponds with the divine light ([link]John 3:19-21[/link]) and worship God, as God seeks, according to what He is ([link]John 4:23-24[/link]). This is the virtue of God ([link]Rom. 3:7[/link]; [link]15:8[/link]) becoming our virtue, by which we love the believers (see note [link]6[sup]6[/sup], point 7, in 1 John 1[/link]). In such genuineness the apostle John, who lived in the divine reality of the Trinity, loved the one to whom he wrote.</note>
        <note num="4">Those who not only have received Christ by believing that He is both God and man but also fully know the truth concerning the person of Christ.</note>
        <note num="5">Denoting the divine reality of the gospel (see note [link]6[sup]6[/sup] in 1 John 1[/link]), especially concerning the person of Christ as revealed in John's Gospel and first Epistle, that is, that Christ is both God and man, having both deity and humanity, possessing both the divine nature and the human nature, to express God in human life and to accomplish redemption with divine power in human flesh for fallen human beings that He may impart the divine life into them and bring them into an organic union with God. The second and third Epistles of John stress this truth. The second warns the faithful believers against receiving those who do not abide in this truth &amp;#8212; in the teaching concerning Christ. The third encourages the believers to receive and help those who work for this truth.</note>

        <note num="1">With his mending ministry concerning the revelation of the person of Christ, the apostle John, in his Gospel and first Epistle, inoculated the believers against the heresies regarding Christ's divinity and humanity.

These two matters are the basic structure of this Epistle. In them grace, mercy, and peace will be with us. The apostle greeted and blessed the believers with grace, mercy, and peace, based on the fact that these two crucial things existed among the believers. When we walk in the truth ([link]v. 4[/link]) and love one another ([link]v. 5[/link]), we will enjoy the divine grace, mercy, and peace.</note>

        <text>[note]1[/note][xref]a[/xref]Look to yourselves that you do not [note]2[/note]lose the [note]3[/note]things which we wrought, but that you may receive a full [note]4[/note]reward.</text>
        <note num="1">I.e., watch yourselves, watch for yourselves.</note>
        <note num="2">Or, destroy, ruin.</note>
        <note num="3">The things that the apostles wrought were the things of the truth concerning Christ, which the apostles ministered and imparted to the believers. To be influenced by the heresies regarding the person of Christ was to lose, destroy, and ruin the precious things concerning the person of Christ that the apostles had wrought into the believers. The apostle warned the believers to watch for themselves lest they be influenced by the heresies and lose the things of the truth.</note>
        <note num="4">According to the context, especially [link]v. 9[/link], the full reward must be the Father and the Son as the full enjoyment to the faithful believers, who abide in the truth concerning the person of Christ and do not deviate from it under the influence of the heresies regarding Christ. This interpretation is justified by the fact that there is no indication that this reward will be given in the future, as will the rewards mentioned in [link]Matt. 5:12[/link]; [link]16:27[/link]; [link]1 Cor. 3:8[/link], [link]13-14[/link]; [link]Heb. 10:35-36[/link]; and [link]Rev. 11:18[/link]; [link]22:12[/link]. If we would not be led astray by the heresies but would abide faithfully in the truth concerning the wonderful and all-inclusive Christ, who is both God and man, both our Creator and our Redeemer, we will enjoy in Him the Triune God to the fullest extent as our full reward, even today on earth.</note>

        <text>Everyone who [note]1[/note]goes beyond and does not abide in the [note]2[/note]teaching of Christ does [xref]a[/xref]not have God; he who abides in the teaching, he [note]3[/note]has both the Father and the Son.</text>
        <note num="1">Lit., leads forward (in a negative sense); i.e., goes further than what is right, advances beyond the limit of orthodox teaching concerning Christ. This is in contrast to abiding in the teaching of Christ. The Cerinthian Gnostics, who boasted of their advanced thinking concerning the teaching of Christ, practiced this. They went beyond the teaching of the divine conception of Christ, thus denying the deity of Christ. Consequently, they could not have God in salvation and in life.</note>
        <note num="2">Not the teaching by Christ but the teaching concerning Christ, that is, the truth concerning the deity of Christ, especially regarding His incarnation by divine conception.</note>
        <note num="3">To have God is to have both the Father and the Son. It is through the process of incarnation that God has been dispensed to us in the Son with the Father ([link]1 John 2:23[/link]) to be our enjoyment and reality ([link]John 1:1[/link], [link]14[/link]). In the incarnated God we have the Son in His redemption and the Father in His life. We are thus redeemed and regenerated to be one with God organically that we may partake of and enjoy Him in salvation and in life. Hence, to deny the incarnation is to reject this divine enjoyment; but to abide in the truth of incarnation is to have God, as the Father and the Son, for our portion in the eternal salvation and in the divine life.</note>

        <note num="1">This indicates what an intimate fellowship with the church members and what an endearing care for them the aged elder had.[br][br]In carrying out his mending ministry with the divine life of the Triune God, the aged apostle John's endearing care for the believers was that the believers would walk in God's truth. God's truth is that the Triune God was incarnated to be the God-man, Christ, who had both divinity and humanity, who through crucifixion accomplished eternal redemption and through resurrection became the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit as the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God, to be received by those who repent and believe in Him, as their life and as their everything. The aged apostle's desire was that the believers would love one another in this truth by the divine love of the Triune God to express Him. This truth, this reality, became the genuineness in the apostle's walk, the divine virtue expressed in his redeemed humanity. He loved the believers whom he cared for, in the genuineness of the divine virtue. His love toward the believers was his living, in which the reality, the truth, of the Triune God was joined to the love of the Triune God. Based on this love, he also earnestly hoped that the believers whom he cared for would be the same as he, that they would love one another and have nothing to do with the heretics, those who went beyond the truth concerning the Trinity. The aged apostle's desire was that the believers whom he cared for would remain continually in the divine truth to enjoy the Father and the Son by the Spirit unto eternity.</note>
