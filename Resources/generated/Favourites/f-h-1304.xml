Very sobering. reading this has lead to a good time of confession and prayer. Thank You Lord for songs like that which remind us of spiritual realities we so quickly close our eyes to. Amen.</article>

    <article author="crizalde m. las" email="" city="philippines" provst="manila" country="Philippines" month="11" day="1" year="2008">This song reminds me of the verses in 1 Thesalonian 4:13-18, parallel verses to 1 Corinthians 15. It says, But I do not want you to be ignorant brethren, concerning those who fallen asleep. For if we believe that Jesus die and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who sleep in Jesus. For this we say to you by the words of our Lord, that we who are alive and remain shall in now way precede those who are sleep. For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven, with a shout, with a voice of archangel, and with the trumpet of God. In the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet, for the trumpet will sound,And the dead in Christ shall will be raised incorruptible, then we shall all be changed, for this corruptible must change to incorruptible, and this mortality must change to immortality, then we will meet the Lord in the air, thus, we shall always be with the Lord. Amen, Amen, Amen.</article>
