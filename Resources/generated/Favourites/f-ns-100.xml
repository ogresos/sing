And what an honor it is to be included in His masterpiece, being part of it!  No wonder my heart sprang when hearing the song and singing stanzas 2 and 3--what a response to the gospel in stanza 1.  This is the gospel I'd like to bring with me wherever I go and that is God the Creator became a God-man, thru and in a process, He produced the church, a wonderful work, His masterpiece!  Come! Lord Jesus.</article>
