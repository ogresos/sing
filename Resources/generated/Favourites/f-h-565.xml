Before I break my fast, I went and prayed again. While praying this song came in my spirit and I started singing. My mom alway sang the song when I was growing up and it brings back lot of memories. It's so comforting. May the Lord bless her soul.</article>
	<article author="Lois Hampton" email="" city="Florence" provst="KY" country="United States" month="1" day="27" year="2016">This was one of my Grandfather's favorite hymns. It came to me as I was doing my devotional but after looking through his old hymnals, I couldn't find it. I was beginning to believe I might have the wrong title when I googled it and there were those oh so comforting words.</article>
	<article author="Bert Mannes" email="ebmannes@gmail.com" city="Chilliwack" provst="BC" country="Canada" month="12" day="27" year="2015">Woke up this morning with snippets of this almost forgotten hymn running through my mind. Remember my mother singing it in church. Been wrestling with many unanswerable questions, and I think God gave me this memory to remind me that He has everything under control. What comforting words!</article>
	<article author="Patricia" email="breadandsoup@gmail.com" city="Bay Shore" provst="New York" country="United States" month="6" day="23" year="2015">I live in Bay Shore and I teach in Brooklyn, NY; so I leave home very early. This morning as I got out of my car after praying all the way to work this tune came to my heart. I sung it for two block while I walked
into my school building and into my classroom. I googled it and was able to sing the whole thing with your piano playing.  Thank you for blessing my heart today.</article>
	<article author="Gerde Ramos" email="" city="Daly City" provst="CA" country="United States" month="6" day="21" year="2015">Yesterday I woke up singing "cubrenos, cubrenos, con Tu manto de amor, cubrenos" (cover us with your mantle of love); the first verse I read was Psa. 91:4 NIV: He will cover you with His feathers...and I remembered Jesus weeping over Jerusalem and using the analogy of a hen covering her chicks to protect them. I remember the shrill screech of an eagle as it circled above Grandpa's hens and chickens and the mother hen's loud squacking to gather her chicks under her wings!</article>
	<article author="Ver" email="" city="Port Saint Lucie" provst="FL" country="United States" month="6" day="11" year="2015">As I was about to go into prayer this morning The Lord gave me this song. I haven't sung this song in a long time and could not find it in my hymnal. This the second day the Lord give me an hymn that is not in that book. The other one is Precious Promise God has given and I believe the Lord is speaking to me. Praise God nothing like when the Lord speak to in songs dreams or His word. Thank you so much.</article>

	<article author="Bonnie" email="" city="Moore" provst="OK" country="United States" month="8" day="18" year="2014">This song came to me today during my devotions. I so wanted to sing it to the Lord but could not pull all the words out of my old mind. Hadn't sung it in so long. Sadly it is not in any of the song books I have. Just needed the words so badly. Thank you for having them on this site. 
O how the old songs come back to me as I pray and worship. I am so grateful that they were in my worship life as I grew up.</article>
	<article author="Collin" email="djbarlow06@gmail.com" city="Johannesburg" provst="Gauteng" country="South Africa" month="12" day="27" year="2013">This is by far the best hymn I have ever heard...Our heavenly Father is truly amazing.

8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.

9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:

10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:

11 For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="10" day="20" year="2013">William O. Cushing had been a pastor of several churches in New York and had enjoyed fruitful ministry. Then a paralysis affected his voice so he could no longer preach.
Not yet 50 years old, Cushing wondered how God could possibly use him. But God did. Cushing wrote texts for more than 300 hymns and gospel songs and teamed up with some of the best-known gospel composers of the day.
When he was 73, this prolific hymnwriter was moved by the words of Psalm 17:8, "Hide me in the shadow of your wings," and thought about God's care for him even when everything seemed dark. This song was the result. Though he could not speak with an audible voice, God multiplied his words for generations to come. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>

	<article author="Hendrietta Nelly Mpele" email="" city="City Of Ekurhuleni (Joburg)" provst="Gauteng" country="South Africa" month="10" day="22" year="2011">This song heals me in times of troubles, when I feel empty and longly, I pray and cry to the Lord to be under His wings.</article>
	<article author="Frank Pytel" email="" city="Chicago" provst="Illinois" country="United States" month="10" day="5" year="2011">When singing along with this hymn I thought it strange that our caring God would be likened to have "wings" as a bird! Yet in the O.T. Jehovah is said to care for His people as an eagle (Deut. 32:11-12), and in the N.T. Jesus is likened to a gathering hen (Matt.23:37), and the Holy Spirt to a dove (John 1:32)! Thank God I can be under His wings!</article>
	<article author="Paulette Harris" email="" city="Charlotte" provst="North Carolina" country="United States" month="6" day="22" year="2009">Under HIS Wings I am safely abiding.

My sister, Linda, wanted this on our Mother's gravestone.  I could not remember the song that she remembered since childhood.  I am especially pleased with her choice after looking it up under this website.

Continued blessings on your wonderful works.</article>
	<article author="Guy DESIR" email="" city="Valley Stream" provst="New-York" country="USA" month="2" day="3" year="2008">This song just express my experiences with God. Any Time, I stayed under his wings I experienced peace and confort no matter the circounstances, financial difficulties, social issues and so on. God is the joy of my life. I really don't know what else to say but I know, He let me been through many times just to shape my characters and my personnal view in his own way. Oh I really love this song ad the lyric is really very appropriate.</article>
	<article author="Sharon" email="" city="Boston" provst="MA" country="U.S.A." month="6" day="30" year="2004">Many times in my walk with the Lord I have experienced fear and frustration but this song which I believe is from Psalm 91 encourages me to remember that God is strong and will see me through every problem and will protect me from all danger. We can always depend on Jesus. I believe He is the standard that God said He would raise up against the enemy when He comes in like a flood.</article>
	<article author="Kay Johnson" email="" city="Florida" provst="" country="U.S.A." month="7" day="6" year="2003">I love this song because it gives me a feeling of refuge &amp; safety, of being tenderly cared for by the Almighty.</article>
	<article author="Bob Baer" email="" city="Brampton" provst="ON" country="Canada" month="4" day="1" year="2003">Sorry, if I sound old-fashioned. I like it because it's one of the favourites from my youth, sung in our congregation in Hopeville, which is near Dundalk which is near a lot of little towns and villages you've probably never heard of that are southwest of Collingwood 40ish miles.

It's a favourite because the words "Under His wings" are comforting. Praise the Lord! I feel comforted...Yeah I know the song is based on a verse in one of the minor prophets. It's Old Testament and I should experience the full operation of God's New Testament economy in the All-inclusive life-giving compound Spirit. I am really trying to get with the program but sometimes I need comfort.

Here's a thought. Is it possible to experience being under His wings as an aspect of the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit in a New Testamental sense? :)</article>
