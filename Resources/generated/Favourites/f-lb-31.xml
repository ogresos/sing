Lord, intensify Your work in our midst. Oh Lord Jesus, we need You! May You raise up more remnants who are fully possessed and captured by You. Lord, we pray that this would be the generation that would bring You back! Lord, do not delay. Cause us to redeem our time in these days. Don't let this generation pass us by again.</article>

	<article author="csk" email="" city="" provst="" country="Hong Kong" month="4" day="3" year="2005">This song always attracts me looking at the Lord and His return. Many generations have passed, many His servants have gone, Lord hasn't come back yet. He waits for New Jerusalem, His Bride, to be prepared well for wedding. Pictures on that day are so wonderful. To be possessed by Him everyday is our goal of living. This accomplishes God's eternal plan and satisfaction. Lord, let's love You, desire Your return everyday.</article>
