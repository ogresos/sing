No one would have a reason to complain over anything. Every trial we face is GOD's love to perfect our characters. Paul wrote "We are troubled on every side, YET not distressed; we are perplexed, BUT not in despair; Persecuted, BUT not forsaken; cast down, BUT not destroyed. For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, YET the inward man is renewed day by day. For our LIGHT afflictions, which is but for a MOMENT, worketh for us a far more exceeding and ETERNAL WEIGHT of glory. While we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen aare etetnal." 2 Cor.4:7-9, 16-18 so I crown the KING of my life.... "Thine shall the glory be!" what I experience here as the greatest trials cannot be compared with what JESUS went through at Calvary. What kind of love was that displayed on the cross and lifted high on a hill.</article>

We should treasure the opportunities given to us to bear His Cross rather than complain in this life. Only He can supply us through all of our trials, but the experience of the Cross will truly bring forth fruit for eternity.</article>

This labor of love flowers forth in endless beauty. "Lead Me to Calvary" is such a bloom. The care of an invalid sister nearly all her adult life was the uncomplaining task of Jennie Hussey. During this time-devouring and strength-testing task, she wrote many poems. They show keen understanding of the meaning of the Cross. She, too, carried a cross, so knew its joy and source of strength. In "Lead Me to Calvary" she bares her love and loyalty to Christ. Through Gethsemane she has come to the rich possession of obedience and surrender. This made her service a joy, and not a burden. What a wonderful testimony! What a wonderful reality! O Lord Jesus, lead me to Calvary, may I be willing, Lord to bear daily my cross for Thee!</article>
