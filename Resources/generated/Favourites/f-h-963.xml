The question mark goes at the end of the stanza. Otherwise the last 2 lines of the stanza hang there alone, not a part of a sentence.

A missionary couple with the China Inland Mission were captured by a band of Chinese terrorists and were being led by an executioner to a lonely spot on a hill. As the executioner raised his arm, they began to sing this song. To their surprise, instead of being executed they were released. They often told this story of their faith and their expectation of seeing the Lord face to face. - Songs of the Spirit by Martin

Grant Tull­ar was help­ing with evan­geli­stic meet­ings in Ru­ther­ford, New Jer­sey. He, along with the pas­tor and the pastor's wife, did some vis­it­a­tion Sun­day af­ter­noon. They got back to the pas­tor’s home ra­ther late, and sup­per was rushed. Things were put on the ta­ble quick­ly, and ev­er­y­one was in­vit­ed to make his own snack. One of the items set out was an al­most emp­ty jar of jel­ly. Know­ing how much Tul­lar liked it, the pas­tor and his wife both passed it by. Tul­lar ac­cept­ed their kind­ness with a smile, say­ing, “So, this is all for me, is it?” In­stant­ly, the lit­tle phrase “all for me” gripped his thoughts. He went over to the pi­a­no and com­posed on the spot the now fa­mil­iar tune, along with some words—“All for me the Sav­ior suf­fered, all for me He bled and died…” The pas­tor was thrilled. He asked that the song be taught to the peo­ple in the even­ing ser­vice. Tul­lar de­clined, say­ing he want­ed to work on it a bit more. But that ne­ver hap­pened. The next day, a let­ter ar­rived from a Car­rie Breck. She had writ­ten a po­em, and won­dered if Mr. Tul­lar could set it to mu­sic. To his amaze­ment, the me­ter ex­act­ly fit the tune com­posed the even­ing be­fore. The two have been to­ge­ther ev­er since. - cyberhymnal</article>

	<article author="Sonia Phillipson_davis" email="sonjah1981@gmail.com" city="Stony Hill" provst="Kingston" country="Jamaica" month="6" day="4" year="2013">When I sing this song there is a feeling of serenity that attends my soul. Especially the part that takes me far beyond the stary sky and face to face with my Saviour in ALL His glory. OH how I long for that day. I must admit that this song leaves a void in my soul at the end. A dreadful longing for home.
Keep this ministry going, to the glory of God. I used it for worship this morning. All the songs are awesome.</article>
