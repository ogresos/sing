	<article author="Adam Last Adam" email="" city="" provst="" country="Indonesia" month="3" day="11" year="2012">The story of Mary is that she loves the Lord Jesus to the uttermost by sacrificing her most precious treasure, all of her heart, and even all of her living and life. The story of Mary is revealing and proving of her response and expression from the story of Jesus.

The story of Jesus is that for God so loved the world, the worst evil men, that is you and me and Mary, that He gave His only begotten Son, that is Himself as Jesus, the very God-man, that every one who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life, that is His life and nature not His Godhead.

Surely Mary believes that story of Jesus, and that makes her receive His eternal life, becoming her new life, her new story, her never ending love story with Him forever and ever.

What a marvelous story of love ever written! The story of mary and the story of Jesus!</article>
	<article author="Bethany" email="" city="Manalapan" provst="NJ" country="United States" month="11" day="16" year="2011">Mary poured her alabaster flask for the Lord. By doing so, she gave her past, present, and future to Him. To many, her offering, as well as the thousands of precious lives, heart treasures, high positions, and golden futures, were "wasted" upon Him; however, these offerings were not a waste but a fragrant testimony of His sweetness. This hymn reminds to me that I must do the same. Lord Jesus, I give my whole being to You!</article>

	<article author="Ann B" email="" city="Rimrock" provst="AZ" country="United States" month="1" day="21" year="2011">O my soul, may my treasure be only Jesus. I come as a needy beggar, yet with boldness, to the Throne Room of Grace.

	<article author="Ray Wiseman" email="" city="Columbus" provst="OH" country="United States" month="9" day="19" year="2010">This song is so touching because what really matters to us as believers in Christ is that we love Him and pour everything out for Him. His preciousness is worth it all! I appreciate this hymn very much because it constantly reminds me to come back to live in this divine romance with those who would be His Bride to bring Him back.

In Him,

	<article author="Liza" email="" city="Virac" provst="Catanduanes" country="Philippines" month="12" day="21" year="2008">It has been a long time when I was saved on July 11, 2001. For these 7 years in the church life I'm so thankful and blessed. I experience the Lord in His all-inclusiveness. 17-year old honeymoon stage with two companions in my college years, a sister and a brother we pursue to gain Christ with the saints, also in Overcomers Club, Campus work Catanduanes State Colleges. I never expected that we can join the Full-Time Training in Malabon. Despite our condition in the family (I have eight brothers and eight sisters in the flesh including me), I remember that we must cut our emotional ties with them. Our friends said to us "Oh what a waste you three." You have already finished your college degree. What are you doing there wasting your time, energy, and lives. For two years in the training: "Oh What a JOY!" It's priceless. May the Lord grant us more Marys in this age who pour out their love offerings. Amen.</article>

	<article author="Esther Lee" email="" city="Folsom" provst="CA" country="United States" month="5" day="1" year="2008">Jesus said to share the story of Mary with others when we preach the Gospel.. 

After seeing how precious the Lord Jesus is to Mary, and how she was so willing to pour everything she had on Him, how can you help but realize the vanity of the world? 


This song is such a genuine prayer, and really speaks against the cultural values of this world. What a shame to the enemy.

What a testimony for the Lord..</article>

Like Mary we should pour everything for the Lord, even we have the most precious things, positions and golden futures all of these are vanity because nothing can compare with the preciousness of our Lord Jesus!
