It shows how these blessings are all of the Triune Godâ€”the Father's choosing and predestinating, the Son's redeeming and the Spirit's sealing and pledging. All these spiritual and heavenly blessings are related to God's divine dispensing to make us God's sons for His eternal glory. What awesome blessings!</article>
