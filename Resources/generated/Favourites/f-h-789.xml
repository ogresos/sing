	<article author="Jared" email="" city="Tulsa" provst="OK" country="United States" month="8" day="30" year="2016">God so often speaks through songs - I know it's Him when I wake up with a song in mind that I have not heard in a long time. With just a few lyrics and the melody in my mind, I searched online for the full hymn and found this page. Like many of you, God brought this song to mind for a time and a purpose today. Pay attention to these messages! God has so much to say to us. Sometimes He's such a chatterbox :)</article>

Amen.</article>

This is the first time the words of the hymn has meant so much to me. We really still carry unnecessary pain and forfeit peace in our lives just because we haven't really relied on God totally. We carry our issues to God but in the same strength we also want to find solutions ourselves to those same issues we carried to God thereby causing ourselves needless heart ache and restlessness.</article>

We just have to come to Jesus's feet and lay them before Him and pray with Him and talk to Him. His love is the healing our souls need.</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="11" day="4" year="2015">"This old standard hymn has always been a comfort and a strength to people. One reason is that it treats Jesus as a friend, brings Him close, makes Him a part of your life. And Jesus *can* be a friend if you *let* Him. Another reason for the strength of this song is that the author really believed this. I remember we were told in Sunday School that Jesus is not only someone great and far away, but someone friendly and close. The teacher told us that when the author was asked how he had come to write this song, he replied, "The Lord and I did it together." That's what I mean - you can't collaborate unless you're friends. I know enough about song writing to know that." - Tennessee Ernie Ford (1919 - 91)

I'm 63 and love the old hymns of my past. some of the contemporary songs are beautiful worship; however, the old hymns seemed to have been forged out of trials, temptations, fear, and such. The resonate with something special. The Holy Spirit speaking through the pain of life to our hearts who thirst after Jesus in are hardships and our pains. God bless you for providing this site and I am grateful to God for leading me to it. Even the piano rendition transports me to the church of my youth, hearing my grandmother sing this song, as well as my mother. Both are with the Lord now. We have so much to look forward to here and in our Hevenly home to come.</article>

	<article author="A sister in the Lord" email="wkmanu@gmail.com" city="Tema" provst="" country="Ghana" month="8" day="12" year="2015">This week in the HWMR on the crystallization study of Exodus message 7, we are in chapter 15 of Exodus. When God's elect got to the bitter waters at Marah. Moses cried to Jehovah after the people complained and murmured and Jehovah showed Moses a tree and instructed him to cast it into the bitter waters. He did and the waters became sweet. 
The ministry explain that the tree cast by Moses into the bitter waters typify the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ which deals with all our biter situations as revealed in 1st Peter 2:24; 
"Who his own self bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live to righteousness: by whose stripes you were healed."
In our bitter situations we should come to the Lord to experience Him in His crucifixion so He can heal us and make our bitter waters sweet. A brother also shared at the just ended National College Training in the US that to apply the cross of Christ is simply to fellowship with the Lord concerning all our situations. Amen.
O what peace we often forfeit,
O what needless pain we bear,
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer!</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="3" day="16" year="2015">This history by George Beverly Shea in "How Sweet the Sound" is a supplement to Isaac Acosta's posting on 10/18/2011 and mine on 9/27/2013:
Joseph Scriven, a young man from Ireland, was to be married in 1840. The night before the wedding, his bride-to-be accidentally drowned.
Moving to Canada, he became a servant to the underprivileged and physically challenged. Again wedding plans ended with the illness and death of his second fiance.
Despite a life of hardship and illness, Mr. Scriven wrote this hymn as his testimony. Even though we go through difficult trials and grief, Jesus is our Friend, a very present help in times of trouble.
In February, 1953, after Dwight D. Eisenhower had just become president, he asked for prayer support from Senator Frank Carlson and Billy Graham. That year, many members of the House and Senate came together for a combined prayer breakfast. These national leaders gathered with the president to pray, to seek God's guidance, and to express their dependence on Him.
I was sitting next to my friend Russell Hitt, who later became editor of "Eternity" magazine. Soon he was asking, "Are you singing this morning?"
"Oh, no, Russ, I'm just here to listen." We were served toast, bacon and eggs. 
Before long I felt a hand on my shoulder. It was Abraham Vereide, the gentleman who had been instrumental in organizing the prayer breakfast movement. He said, "My friend, would you come up with me and sing the president's favorite hymn, 'What a Friend We Have in Jesus'?"
Now what was I going to do? I had just finished eating soft eggs, a singer's nemesis. In almost the next minute I was at the microphone, saying to the audience, "If you'd like to sing along, please do."
The next day, back home in Illinois, I turned on "The Today Show" and was so surprised to see the president standing next to me, singing along with all of us:
O what peace we often forfeit,
O what needless pain we bear,
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer!</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="9" day="27" year="2013">Not far from Port Hope, Ontario [east of Toronto on Lake Erie], stands a monument with this inscription: "4 miles north, in Pengally's Cemetery, lies the philanthropist and author of this great masterpiece, written at Port Hope, 1857." Above the inscription are the words of this beloved hymn.
Scriven never intended to publish this hymn. He wrote the words to accompany a letter to his mother, who was ill in far-off Ireland. He had no material resources to send her - only a reminder that the most perfect of friends, Jesus Himself, was nearby. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton

See Isaac Acosta's posting on 10/8/2011 for more on the history of this hymn.
----------------------------------
There is a 4th stanza, which is usually omitted:
Blessed Savior, Thou hast promised 
Thou wilt all our burdens bear
May we ever, Lord, be bringing 
all to Thee in earnest prayer.
Soon in glory bright unclouded 
there will be no need for prayer
Rapture, praise and endless worship 
will be our sweet portion there.</article>

	<article author="Isaac Acosta" email="" city="Irvine, CA" provst="" country="United States" month="10" day="18" year="2011">When Joseph Scriven was asked who wrote the [Charles C. Converse (1834-1918)] words to the poem he had on his wall he said, "The Lord and I did it between us." The poem was "What a Friend We Have in Jesus." 

Joseph Scriven (1819-1886) learned early in life to give his griefs to the Lord. On the eve of his wedding day, his bride was found drowned. This crushed him. He left his homeland of Ireland and moved to Port Hope, Canada. He found Jesus to be his best friend and decided to give his life to be a friend and a help to others. He became known as the "Good Samaritan of Port Hope." He wrote the poem "What A Friend We Have in Jesus" as an encouragement for his sick mother. We, like Scriven's mother, are reminded again that we have a friend who wants to know our cares, griefs, burdens, temptations, trials, sins, pain, and sorrows. Jesus is that friend. Have you spoken to Him today?</article>
	<article author="Yutaka Kobayashi" email="" city="Sakurasi" provst="Chiba Pref." country="Japan" month="10" day="5" year="2011">This hymns is the famous tune for non-Christians. Brilliant! Brilliant! I sing well this hymn in the gospel meeting of the church. The bride of the author of this hymn Joseph Scriven passed away before the wedding. Oh! what tragedy! He wrote this lyric at the lowest ebb of his life. But, what is the reason this hymn is sung at the marriage ceremony of many non-Christians in Japan?? I hope many people receive salvation from sins by our LORD, Jesus Christ. "What a Friend we have in Jesus, all our sins and griefs to bear!" Yes, Amen.</article>

I have found the life in fellowship in Christ the ONLY victorious life full of hope. This song is my personal testimony which I am prepared to boldly testify to the whole world that a friend in Jesus is a relationship so meaningful and more closer over any other that one can think of or find and rely on in this world.

	<article author="Sajan" email="" city="Riverdale" provst="" country="United States" month="7" day="29" year="2009">O what peace we often forfeit, O what needless pain we bear! O how often we need to be reminded that... All because we do not carry, everything to God in Prayer. I love these lines, it makes so much sense. Only if we believe like a little child, God is waiting to do what he did for the 3 Hebrew friends, or part the Red Sea. Our lack of faith stands in the way of His miracles through us.</article>
	<article author="Dr. William K. Maina" email="" city="Nairobi" provst="Nairobi" country="Kenya" month="3" day="15" year="2009">It reminds us constantly that we need not worry about our troubles since we have a God who is able to take way all our burdens and set us free. Even when we have trials and temptations, once we call upon the Lord He will save us. 10 years ago, I lost my dear dad due to stroke. 3 weeks after his burial, my mother who had never been to hospital even once went down with stroke--she lost her speech. I cried to the Lord to preserve her even though she can't speak to me. For all this time God has sustained her on that wheel chair but am thankful to God because He has proved to me that He is able to keep. Praise Be to God!</article>

Indeed, we need to trust in the Lord and in nothing be anxious. By prayer, petition and thanksgiving, we give our load, our burdens and our anxieties to God, and allow His peace to reign in us everyday. We simply need to say, ""Lord, I commit everything in Your hand."</article>
	<article author="Jen" email="" city="Bundaberg" provst="" country="Australia" month="1" day="18" year="2004">In this world of Christian loneliness, this song is a real blessing as it tells us we have always have a friend we can walk with and talk to and He will take the load from us.

	<article author="Joy Kim" email="" city="Fullerton" provst="CA" country="U.S.A." month="10" day="19" year="2003">I enjoy this hymn because it reminds me that I don't have to bear my burdens alone, and that in fact, I don't have to bear them at all. My favorite lines from this hymn are "Oh what peace we often forfeit / Oh what needless pain we bear / All because we do not carry / Everything to God in prayer." We have no need to suffer! Just take it to the Lord in prayer. Prayer doesn't have to be something grandiose and eloquent. Simply by putting "Lord," in front of all our complaints or thanks, we are practically fellowshipping with this wonderful Friend we have in Jesus.</article>
	<article author="Morris Rainville" email="" city="" provst="" country="U.S.A." month="10" day="7" year="2003">As a teenager, this hymn saved my life. I was very depressed and wanted to end it all — and I was afraid that I really would end it all. One day, as I listened to this hymn, the clouds of depression just floated away. Pure heavenly sunlight flooded my soul and I have been blest with Christ's presence ever since.</article>

Take it to Him in prayer and I promise that you will rise up feeling better because He truely loves us and can take any situation and make good out of it. I am a Truck Driver gone from home 15 days at a time and yesterday I broke my leg. My first thought was what will I do for money, but you know if I went back out on the road at this time I may have been killed and it would be more like what will my family do without me. I can just use this time to attend church which is rare for me to do on a regular basis.</article>

My uncle (her son) is fighting with his brother over money and I told him how silly that was, and that his mother would be upset to think any of her 11 children would fight over money. And I quoted this hymn in wishing he'd turn the problem over to God...and couldn't remember all the words. And then I found your website...you can't know how grateful I am. Wow! Surely my Gram and God brought me swiftly to the right place to find the help my uncle needs. Thanks ever so much. PS I'm 54, my uncle is 79 and Gram's been gone 41 years...still I hear her and see her kindly face. I guess my uncles can't see her as clearly...</article>
