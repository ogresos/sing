Nothing is more precious than Christ! We need to not pay attention to any matters, persons, things, and just press on toward the goal! Sometimes the enemy likes to distract us. But nothing is more attractive than Christ! He Himself is the power holding us to press on!</article>
	<article author="Veronica Tessler" email="" city="Ontario" provst="CA" country="United States" month="3" day="27" year="2010">An email was sent to me by a brother in the middle age full time training in Anaheim. There was a link to this hymn and I for once opened up the link and sang the hymn. It was very encouraging! I also clicked on the reference to this hymn, Philippians 3:10-14 and I enjoyed verse 13 and 14, "Brothers, I do not account of myself to have laid hold; but one thing I do: Forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before. I pursue toward the goal for the prize to which God in Christ Jesus has called me upward." Hallelujah for the goal which is the fullest enjoyment and gaining of Christ!!!</article>

No matter what our experiences,understanding,feeling,human relationship,condition,choice, point of view,conveniency,learning and background it will not affect to us 'coz the TRUTH IS THE TRUTH nothing but the TRUTH. This will be our stand, while we are waiting for the Lord's coming back press on press on toward the goal to gain the prize of God's high call.(pcv)</article>
