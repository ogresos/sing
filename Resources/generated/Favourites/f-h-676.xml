	<article author="Benalex" email="churchumbadba@yahoo.com" city="Guelph" provst="Ontario" country="Canada" month="11" day="21" year="2015">My God understands of my recent grief—my wife of 39 years has been suffering with paranoia, delusion and hallucination. 
Far too well thy Savior loves thee
 To allow thy life to be
One long, calm, unbroken summer—
 One unruffled, stormless sea;
He would have thee fondly nestling
 Closer to His loving breast,
He would have that day seem brighter
 When alone is perfect rest.</article>

Needful is each one for thee;
All thy tears by Him are counted,
One too much there cannot be;
And if while they fall so quickly
Thou canst own His way is right,
Then each bitter tear of anguish
Precious is in Jesus' sight.

Hallelujah!
Christ gives me strenght whenever I am weak. Christ is Victor.</article>
