1. “Eternal salvation” (Heb. 5:9).

We are saved once for all. Our salvation is not based upon our works or ourselves; instead, it is based upon the Lord and His work. We ourselves and our works can change and are not reliable, but the Lord and His work will not change and are eternally reliable. We cannot obtain the Lord’s salvation by our works, and we cannot lose the Lord’s salvation by our works. The Lord did not save us because of things that we have done, and He will not take away His salvation because of things that we will do. Since our salvation is apart from works, our works have absolutely no effect on our salvation. The Lord’s gift of salvation issues from the grace of His unchanging love and is based upon His eternal work of redemption which He accomplished on the cross. Therefore, it cannot be changed with respect to us because of our works. The Lord, His love, His grace, and His work are all eternal and unchanging. Therefore, the salvation He gives is also eternal and unchanging. Because His grace and His work have saved us, our salvation is once for all.</article>
