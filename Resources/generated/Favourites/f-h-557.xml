Habershon was born in Marylebone, England on Jan­u­a­ry 8, 1861. Her father, Dr. Samuel Osborne Ha­ber­shon, was a noted physician; her mother was Grace Habershon. She was raised in Chelsea, London, in a Christian home. In her twenties, she was a member of the circle surrounding Charles Spurgeon. She met Dwight L. Moody and Ira D. Sankey in 1884 during their preaching tour of England. At their urging, she visited the United States, delivering a series of lectures on the Old Testament that were later published.

Habershon's first foray into hymn writing came in 1899, when she wrote several hymns in the German language. She wrote her first English language hymns in 1901, while ill. In 1905, Charles M. Alexander and Ruben A. Torrey toured the UK, and Alexander asked Habershon to write hymns for use during this evangelistic tour. Habershon ultimately sent Alexander over 200 hymns.

Her best know hymn is the original "Will the Circle Be Unbroken". Modern versions of this song still use her chorus.

She also wrote many books, booklets and magazine articles, her favorite topic being the Old Testament types. - Wikipedia &amp; Songs of the Spirit by Martin</article>
