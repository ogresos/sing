	<article author="Rishie" email="rishie@dodo.com.au" city="Glen Innes" provst="NSW" country="Australia" month="2" day="3" year="2013">I love this verse particularly:
1 Lord, now I see,
You only want me to believe
Not to change.
In all my failures and defeats
To believe what You have done,
And not in what I see.

I think I've been focusing tooo much on trying to change some things about my life that I believe God wants me to do differently and not enough focusing on God Himself and all He has done. How awesome our God is that He just wants us to believe and enjoy him! O Lord my faith is so weak, help me to just believe and enjoy You. Forgive me for being so discouraged by my failures. Like Peter when he fell after walking on the water, I cry out to You to save me from the sea of depression , self-pity, anger and discouragement I have fallen into. Thank You Jesus that You are faithful. Amen. 
God is so good, He uses all kinds of ways to get our attention. He is worthy of all the praise. Amen!</article>

Many things happened that day, failures in projects and everything related to school just keeps on failing. Even when I was on my way to the meeting hall, it's as if Satan is just fond of keeping me away from it. But inside me, there was Someone speaking that I need to drink because my spirit is athirst. I don't know, when I enterd the meeting hall, this was the hymn. And I was touched by the message. And many more hymns I heard that is as if the Lord is talking to me through them. Praise His name now and forevermore!</article>
