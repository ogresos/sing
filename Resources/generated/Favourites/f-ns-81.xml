We're not reigning in a merely outward way. The true reigning is letting this One and His life reign in us! In all our situations and crossroads, it's not our being able to will-power or triumph over things...the true reigning is learning to depend on this life. This is awesome.</article>

Corporately in the church life, as we are being built up together in God's life, we as the Body shall crush Satan (Romans 5:17, 16:20). This is how Matthew 16:18 will be fulfilled.</article>
