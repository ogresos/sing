It was very touching. There were a lot of testimonies of how easy it is to see the signs that the Lord instituted, yet not see Him.</article>

I'm going to call it at our next table meeting!</article>
    <article author="Wesley" email="" city="Auckland" provst="" country="New Zealand" month="6" day="25" year="2012">The week before my sister passed away I was introduced to this hymn. How wonderful that when we are gathered into the Lord's name at the breaking of bread we can behold our dear Lord. He desires that we stop all our working and allow Him to minister to us. His riches are unsearchable!</article>
