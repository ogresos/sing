    <article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="11" day="16" year="2013">Christopher Wordsworth took after his father, a scholar, and his uncle, the famous poet William Wordsworth. Christopher became a school headmaster, church vicar, and eventually a bishop in the Church of England. As a Greek scholar, he wrote a commentary on the Bible. But his uncle's poetic spark was in him too, and he wrote more than 100 hymns for church use.
Wordsworth tried to combine teaching and poetry in his hymns. He wanted his hymns to teach about Jesus and to call those who sang them to praise Him. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown and Norton

There are additional stanzas:
6. Holy Ghost, llluminator, 
shed Thy beams upon our eyes,
Help us to look up with Stephen, 
and to see beyond the skies,
Where the Son of Man in glory 
standing is at Godâ€™s right hand,
Beck'ning on His martyr army, 
succoring, succoring, succoring 
His faithful band.
---------------
7. See Him, who is gone before us, 
heavenly mansions to prepare,
 See Him, who is ever pleading 
for us with prevailing prayer,
 See Him, who with sound of trumpet, 
and with His angelic train,
 Summoning the world to judgment, 
on the clouds, on the clouds, on the clouds,
 will come again.
----------------------
8. Raise us up from earth to Heaven, 
give us wings of faith and love,
 Gales of holy aspirations 
wafting us to realms above;
 That, with hearts and minds uplifted, 
we with Christ our Lord may dwell,
 Where He sits enthroned in glory 
in His heavenly citadel.
----------------------------
9. So at last, when He appeareth, 
we from out our graves may spring,
 With our youth renewed like eagles, 
flocking round our heavenly King.
 Caught up on the clouds of Heaven, 
and may meet Him in the air,
 Rise to realms where He is reigning, 
and may reign, and may reign, and may reign,
 for ever there.
------------------------
10. Glory be to God the Father, 
glory be to God the Son,
 Dying, risen, ascending for us, 
who the heavenly realm has won;
 Glory to the Holy Spirit, 
to one God in persons Three;
 Glory both in earth and Heaven, 
glory be, glory be, glory
endless glory, be.</article>
