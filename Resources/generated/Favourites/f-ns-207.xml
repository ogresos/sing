    <article author="M.O." email="" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="6" day="24" year="2010">This song really touched me, it explained my feelings within which I could not understand. As a young person in the Lord's recovery, I cannot do the things or be the way that others can, because I have been bought by the Lord. Some days I feel like having the Lord is simply a burden. But I only need to realize how beautiful and tender He is, I only need to fall in love with Him again. Praise the Lord!</article>

Yet, could someone share more on what does it mean with the last two lines in stanza one? "Could You ever break through within us if we give You a part?"</article>
