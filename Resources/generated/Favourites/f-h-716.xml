	<article author="Ruby Tagoe" email="" city="Accra" provst="" country="" month="4" day="8" year="2014">I have sung this song for so many years being a methodist. Now I attend a charismatic church because that's where my husband fellowship. But this song came to me so strongly as I showered this morning. The message it brought, I haven't had that throughout my 30 years of being a methodist. It's such a blessing. Thank You Jesus.</article>

Is heavy and tart
I wonder and think
Why I must be part
But then I remember
He gave me His all
So I like my Jesus
Will answer God's call</article>
	<article author="Adedayo James" email="dayo4excellence@yahoo.co.uk" city="London" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="8" day="25" year="2013">What a wonderful and inspiring song. I have known it since my childhood and it has been a refreshing companion ever since. The words of it - how heavy, how spiritual, how true! The composer, like many Hymn writers, truly had the precious Old-Time faith, which our present fast-paced and light world lacks.   How I love the song!</article>
	<article author="Joseph Ato-biney" email="" city="Winneba" provst="" country="Ghana" month="5" day="4" year="2013">What a hymn! Very poetic to the core! The words of this hymn give much assurance that when I listen to it my eyes are filled with tears. I have been through many trials and temptations like any true child of God will have to experience, yet this hymn has been a favourite and I give the Almighty, Omnipotent God, the El-Shadai all the glory for the writer of this song, that is, a British, John Newton. I like the rendition of the Winneba Youth Choir. It is very moving!</article>
	<article author="Kingsley" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="2" day="1" year="2013">A very encouraging hymn. It is fast becoming my favourite. I have sung it 10x already today.</article>
	<article author="Belinda Johnstone" email="belinda123j@hotmail.co.uk" city="Bromley" provst="Kent" country="United Kingdom" month="12" day="9" year="2012">To remember that God is always near, gives us such great relief. The words of "Be gone, unbelief, my Saviour is near" is a constant reminder of why CHRIST died for us all especially for my family and I. So when troubles come make a conscious effort to smile at the storm.</article>
	<article author="Akosua Achiaa" email="" city="" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="11" day="18" year="2012">The word of God tells us that in this world there shall be tribulations. But we must be of good cheer for He has overcome the world. This hymn sums it all up and I sing on relying on the unfailing assurance my Lord Jesus has given me.</article>
	<article author="Tom And Corinne Palmer" email="" city="Sanford" provst="Florida" country="United States" month="8" day="14" year="2012">My wife and I have sung this remarkable song for many years, both in times of discouragement or times of joy. It has spoken to us and encouraged us many times to be looking to Him and not to our seemingly impossible circumstances in our missionary work in Papua New Guinea. I am not sure of the author, or where we learned it, probably from our British co-workers. I think it is of British origin.</article>
	<article author="alan labor" email="" city="freetown" provst="" country="Sierra Leone" month="5" day="16" year="2009">Hymn singing is a favourite hobby amongst the Christian inhabitants of the city of Fretown in Sierra Leone (one of the oldest cities of western civilization and Christianity) with their long history of slavery and freedom. Begone unbelief is quite popular, it speaks of assurance each stanza of it! What a lovely hymn, one of my grandmother's favourite! With tears of joy I sing it always and it indeed strengthens my faith especially when things go wrong. Let us sing on!</article>
	<article author="Brenda Deleveaux" email="" city="Nassau NP" provst="" country="Bahamas" month="3" day="31" year="2009">When I awoke on 03/30/09, the Holy Spirit brought this song to me very forcefully all I knew was the first line and it was very encouraging and uplifting at the time.</article>
	<article author="James Osborne" email="" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="6" day="16" year="2008">The tune of this song seemed so familiar.  Then I realized that it was the same tune to "O Worship The King."  It does make a very regal statement when sung and played.</article>
	<article author="Adenike Odunuga" email="" city="Abuja" provst="" country="Nigeria" month="3" day="8" year="2007">This song comes with a forceful command to unbelief, a crippling foe that often clings to us to go away. I like the force with which it comes when I am sometimes in doubt. It comes with affirmation and assurance that gives doubt itself no doubt that you know what you are saying. It is either you do not sing it or you sing it and be filled with faith.</article>
