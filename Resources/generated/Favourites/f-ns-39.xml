    <article author="C.F." city="" provst="" country="Canada" month="12" day="4" year="2009">Lord, I'm not strange, I just can't change
It's not from lack of effort though
The more I try, the more I find
I need for You to grow.

Where I have failed, Lord You've prevailed
The secret of success I know:
That all I need is life indeed,
I pray for You to grow.

As I go on, daily I see how much I lack, how much I fail, how much I really need to be transformed. But praise the Lord that all I need is Him! I just need life! I feel I always try so hard to change, but I really enjoy that what the Lord is saying to me is not "you need to change" but "you need to let Me grow in You!"; this is the secret. Lord, I pray for You to grow! I just need YOU.</article>

I now walk in Him, talk in Him. in Him i will surely grow!!!</article>
