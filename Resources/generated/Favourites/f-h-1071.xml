I am glad Jesus died for me. He saves me from all my sins. As many that comes to Him, He will not cast away. Jesus can still save you. Come to Him believing and He will save you from all your sins.

I love playing all these old "come all yas!" a term we use for these singy hymns! Im a Methodist and this is a classic Methodist Hymnbook. And if this was in the top 40, it would be high up! I also like the words and the promise of eternal life, that even if you're a Christian who sins, God loves you and forgives you which is really great! Cracking hymn!</article>
