	<article author="" email="" city="Toronto" provst="ON" country="Canada" month="9" day="22" year="2002">Hallelujah! This song tells us that our song can be of Jesus!  This song has always been special to me, because I'm the type of person who gets absorbed into music very easily. This means that whenever I hear or sing a song, I immediately fall into its mood, whether it's sad or happy.

I used to listen to the radio very frequently in the car, and because the Lord made me so that I get engrossed in music, I felt spiritually dead every time I listened to the radio. The music really brought me into myself, and caused me to feel empty. I'm sure that for some people, it's listening to music, but for others, it may be watching movies or television.

One night when I was in the car with my dad, driving to the Saturday night young people's meeting, I was busy switching radio stations until I could find a song I liked. Because I was concentrating on which station to go to, I didn't realize that we were going to hit a bus. If I hadn't been so busy concentrating on the radio, maybe it could have been prevented.

Fortunately, the damage was very minor. None of us got hurt, and the car wasn't beaten too badly either. The next time I was in the car listening to the radio, I felt very uneasy. Eventually I stopped listening to it completely.

When I look back, that accident could have been the Lord telling me something. Soon, instead of listening to worldly music, I turned to listening to hymns on tapes. My enjoyment of the Lord really increased, because I listened to them every time I was in the car, and each time, I was filled with more of the Lord.

In Hymn 165, I really enjoy the parts, "He fills my cup with blessings, And tunes my heart to praise" and, "My song shall be of Jesus, Whatever ill betide; I'll sing the grace that saves me, And keeps me at His side."</article>
