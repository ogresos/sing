Thy Word is like a garden, Lord,
With flowers bright and fair;
And every one who seeks may pluck
A lovely cluster there.

A garden versus a storehouse is really different. The more I get into these variations, I cannot help but appreciate the labor of the brothers before us to present hymns that are more in line with truth and therefore are more meaningful. Praise the Lord!</article>
