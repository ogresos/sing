    <article author="Paul" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="6" day="28" year="2013">The Spirit of Christ always leads us to live a crucified life, conforming us to the death of Christ. In Philippians 3:10 Paul said that He desired to know Christ, the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death. The wonderful Spirit works to conform us to the death of Christ.
The cross of Christ is applied to us by the Spirit (Rom. 8:13b). In the Spirit, there is the killing element of the cross. When we live by the Spirit, the Spirit within us will kill all the negative things, such as sin, Satan, the world, me, the old man, and all the differences due to ordinances. We need to apply the cross of Christ to our flesh with the passions and the lusts through the cooperation with the Spirit (Gal. 5:24).
The experience of the cross of Christ issues in the abundance of the Spirit of life. According to Galatians 2:20, the more we experience the cross of Christ, the more Christ lives in us. John 12:24 shows that the Lordâ€™s death as a grain of wheat issued in much fruit. When we experience the death of Christ, the issue is the multiplication of life. Furthermore, we boast in the cross of Christ (Gal. 6:14a). The cross was really an abasement, but the Apostle Paul made it his boast.
The Spirit brings us to the cross. If we take the cross, the cross will issue in more of the Spirit. Before Christ went to the cross, the Spirit was always leading Him. This leading Spirit always led Him to the cross. The entire life of Christ was a life led by the Spirit to the cross. Christ lived a crucified life, a life under the cross for thirty-three and a half years. Every day of His life, He was being crucified by the Holy Spirit. Even when He went to the physical cross for six hours, He went there by the eternal Spirit of God and offered Himself to God through this Spirit (Heb. 9:14). Therefore, the Spirit comes first and then the cross. When we were saved, the first thing we received was the Spirit. Then from that time onward, this Spirit leads us to the cross. We have to undergo the process of being crossed out all the time by allowing the Spirit to bring us to the cross, so that the cross can issue in more of the Spirit.

    <article author="Frank Pytel" email="" city="Chicago" provst="Illinois" country="United States" month="11" day="7" year="2010">In our early revelation of Christ as seen in the Song of Songs, we see Him as one moving upon the mountains and the hills (2:8). We only see with appreciation, but have so little experience. There comes a point when we need to be with Him, in His experiences. Who He is and what He has done is no longer something distant, but we enter until every shadow in our life disappears (4:6). The negative shadows or the positive ones flee away and we have Him with His death and His resurrection! We begin to match Him!</article>
