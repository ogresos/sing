This is a great little site! Thank you Steve for your insightful comments. I grew up in the Detroit area and my father was the song leader at our church. And yes, to all the other comments, it's awesome to be redeemed!</article>

At the age of 20 he became a traveling singing teacher establishing singing schools. He was associated with a southern evangelist, Sam Jones. Excell was recognized as one of the best song leaders in his day, and it is said that he wrote and/or composed around 2,000 hymns and published 50 songbooks. He died at the age of 70 while assisting Gipsy Smith in his evangelistic campaigns. - Songs of the Spirit by Martin
-------------------
Excel'l's 1909 stanza selection and arrangement of "Amazing Grace" became the most widely used and familiar setting of that hymn by the 2nd half of the 20th century. The influence of his sacred music on American popular culture was substantial enough by the 1920's to garner a satirical reference by Sinclair Lewis in the novel Elmer Gantry.
