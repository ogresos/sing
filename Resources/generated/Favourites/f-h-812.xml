	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="31" year="2008">In our approach to the Bible today, we may be either in the 'day' or in the 'night.' By the Lord's mercy, we can testify that concerning the Bible we in the Lord's recovery are in the 'day.' As we read the Word of God, we experience sunrise, not sunset. But when many read the Bible, they are in the 'night.' As Paul said of the Jews, there is a veil upon their heart in the reading of the Scriptures (2 Cor. 3:14). They are veiled by their tradition and by their natural concepts. In their experience the Bible thus becomes a book of dead letters. Like the ancient Pharisees, scribes, and Judaizers, they handle the Word without directly contacting the Lord. Instead of exercising their spirit, they rely on their natural understanding. Furthermore, they are often zealous to maintain their religious tradition. But whenever we come to the Word, we need to contact the Lord. As we come to the Lord in the Word, we need to hunger and thirst for Him and seek to enjoy Him. This seeking after the Lord is well expressed in the lines of a hymn:
... [Stanzas 1 and 2]

In our reading and pray-reading of the Word, we should seek the Lord's glorious, radiant face. Then in our experience the Word of God will be a source of life supply and nourishment, and we shall be in the 'day,' not in the 'night.'
