	<article author="Mario Shaffer" email="marioshaffer@alumni.usc.edu" city="Lake Forest" provst="CA" country="United States" month="8" day="15" year="2016">I woke up this morning after attending wonderful blending conference with the California Churches in Anaheim, Fullerton, Yorba Linda, Riverside and Long Beach enjoying this hymn and remembering brother Howard Higashi's deep love for the Lord by singing this spiritual song and as I began to sing it, I became filled in my human spirit like it says in Ephesians 5:18 enjoying the divine life giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b) so I sent it to my friends so they could enjoy being one spirit with the Lord (1 Cor. 6:17). (I used to sing stanza four line four "Open your being to Him, just call and let Him in, Oh Lord Jesus, breathe in Jesus" thank You Lord for providing Hymnal.net as a vehicle to touch You.</article>
