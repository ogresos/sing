She wrote 107 hymns. - Songs of the Spirit by Martin

A young of­fi­cer in the Brit­ish ar­my turned away in hor­ror from the doc­trine of this hymn. His pride re­volt­ed, his self-right­eous­ness rose in re­bel­lion, and he said: “He would be a cow­ard in­deed who would go to hea­ven at the cost of ano­ther!” As the years rolled away this man rose to dis­tinct­ion and high rank in the ar­my, and he al­so learned wis­dom. In his last hours, as he lay on his death­bed, he re­peat­edl­y begged those near him to sing “O Christ, what bur­dens bowed Thy head,” call­ing it, “My hymn, my hymn!” - Sankey's Story of the Gospel Hymns</article>

How can one improve upon that? Unfortunately we in our church never sang this hymn, but our pastor, Al Martin quoted it the first time (for us) during his preaching through Mark's Gospel when he got to the part about Jesus being in the garden of Gethsemane (Mk. 14:36) and a few times after that during his sermons. Also, someone in the church had it printed on fancy paper and I got a copy of it to read some years ago. I was happy to find it here as I lost my copy of it.
What a blessing!</article>

When we gathered together to remember our Lord and Saviour round His table until He comes again.
Happy days of fellowship and sang the hymn to the tune "Rowan Tree".
God Bless who look for His return.</article>
