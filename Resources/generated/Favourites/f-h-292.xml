    <article author="Betty Bonn" city="Dunlap" provst="Illinois" country="United States" month="2" day="14" year="2012">Charles Spurgeon quotes this hymn in his devotional book, Morning and Evening. A beautiful meditation for February 13 precedes it, concluding with the following: "All the love and the acceptance which perfect obedience could have obtained of God, belong to thee, because Christ was perfectly obedient on thy behalf, and hath imputed all His merits to thy account, that thou mightst be exceeding rich through Him, who for thy sake became exceeding poor. Oh! how great the debt of love and gratitude thou owest to thy Saviour! Morning and Evening.</article>

    <article author="steward" city="Columbus" provst="ND" country="United States" month="11" day="27" year="2008">It is really mercy. And it is the Father's great love towards us, and His dear Son's obedience to the death of the cross, that this mercy has taken effect by the application of the Spirit, as we believe and as we receive the divine power to become the sons of God, which sons we are, and the whole creation is waiting for us to be manifested. What a mercy, that we sinners become the sons of God! Christ, the son of Man, has made the way for us, by His all-inclusive death upon the cross and by His all glorious, victorious resurrection. And it is in His ascension that He is bringing us into glory. Praise the Father! Praise the Son! Praise the Spirit! Praise our God, the Three in One!!!</article>
