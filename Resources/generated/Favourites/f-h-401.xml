That was the life of Anna, as she served God in the temple. We know little of this lady except that she was devoted to God. When pondering the great lesson of her life I remembered this lovely devotional hymn, learnt as a child and brought to mind by the Spirit at times such as these, when my activity need the fuel of praise and worship so that my motivation is Godly pertinent.</article>

It covers all we need to be to live a Christ-like life. Pray continually for a renewed mind and you will grow closer to Him and all He has in mind for you to carry out in His name. I pray God's blessings on all who read this. Amen.</article>

	<article author="Carol" email="fluffca@gmail.com" city="Kampala" provst="" country="Uganda" month="9" day="23" year="2014">We are studying the Life of Moses in BSF. I love how despite his past, Moses chose to leave it all and walk with the Lord every day. As I answered my lesson, I prayed to God that I would learn to walk with him EVERY SINGLE DAY, every hour, every minute. And as I finished answering the day's questions, this morning, this hymn crossed my mind. We learnt it in high school and it was a favourite hymn for me. So I looked it up to to remember all the words and I was blessed anew, by the words and all the comments too. May God teach us to walk with Him day by day...</article>

	<article author="Frank Alcamo" email="" city="Glendale" provst="New York" country="United States" month="1" day="31" year="2012">This hymn expresses the prayer of my heart perfectly that is why the apostle Peter calls our love for Jesus: "Like precious faith" or "the common salvation".
I am sure these sentiments are shared by millions of Christians all over the world.
Prais the Lord for such prayers as this.</article>
