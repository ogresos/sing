	<article author="Chris Newman" email="c_available@mail.com" city="Upper Hutt" provst="Wellington" country="New Zealand" month="5" day="9" year="2016">Praise God! What wonderful words! "Let goods and kindred go, ... The body they may kill also. God's truth abideth still" and will triumph through us. As we ponder these words how wonderful to know a living hope is there for us.</article>
	<article author="Pamelli SantAnna" email="poetoftherock07@gmail.com" city="Mozarlândia" provst="Goiás" country="Brazil" month="5" day="2" year="2016">This is my favorite hymn!!! Can someone tell me what is this version? I saw 2 or 3 english versions and I found this more easy to learn.</article>
	<article author="Tony Barker" email="tonyfisherofmen@gmail.co.za" city="Nelspruit" provst="Mpumulanga" country="South Africa" month="9" day="10" year="2015">The basis of the reformation was the "rediscovery" of two pillars of Christian faith, "solo scriptura", or Scripture alone and "solo fidei", by faith alone, which knocked the legs out of the Roman Church making him deeply unpopular. The hymn is a response to the plots and persecution that followed.</article>
	<article author="Eniesha Swaby" email="swabyeniesha@yahoo.com" city="Beckley" provst="West Virginia" country="United States" month="8" day="12" year="2015">These words should be song with might and power as it is to me a song of the ages. This is the song that the saints of the ruler and creator of the heaven and the earth will be singing through persecution as it was so through the dark periods before. Saints of God, I am urging us to keep the faith, the end is fast approaching.</article>

Like the grass that withers and the flower that fades, so shall we go the way of this earth and into eternity, but only to find the highest supremacy of His truth--TRUTH that exists with us, or without us.</article>

	<article author="Deb" email="kitcat51355@aol.com" city="Charlotte" provst="NC" country="United States" month="6" day="21" year="2015">When the 9 people were murdered during their Bible Study Class this week in Charleston, SC, I wrote a note and felt so helpless for words of comfort and then remembered this wonderful hymn and the words seemed so perfect to send to them. It's always been one of my favorites and I hope it will help bring healing to the loved ones of those murdered in Charleston.</article>
	<article author="Elvida Hildyard" email="elvida.eh@googlemail.com" city="Northampton" provst="Northamptonshire" country="United Kingdom" month="10" day="25" year="2014">My favorite song, sang it in 3 languages when I was growing up in rural Tanzania where the Lutheran church came to our village about 100 years ago. He has been my fortress till today in my 72nd year and will be so for eternity, Hallelujah. Thank You Lord for giving us Martin Luther who fourght for our faith in Jesus by Your Grace.</article>
	<article author="Arthur Sinkala" email="atksinks@gmail.com" city="Kitwe" provst="Copperbelt" country="Zambia" month="8" day="29" year="2014">Very inspiring and indeed encouraging. Only a close walk with God can cause one to write thus. I gues this is what is absent today. Luther had no other help but God. Like Christ Luther had nowhere to lay his head.</article>

In this darkness Christ becomes the only light. "This is good, and pleases God our Savior."</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="10" day="31" year="2013">After posting his 95 theses on the door of Wittenberg's Castle Church in October, 1517, Martin Luther faced many years of trials and persecution. And during the years of the ensuing Protestant Reformation, Luther came to know better than most the gracious power of God's sheltering hand. He confidently stepped forward to defend the truth he found in God's Word, despite excommunication from the Roman church, continual threats to his life and freedom, and times of intense spiritual battle.
In the comforting words of Psalm 46, Luther found the inspiration for this hymn that would become the battle cry of the Protestant Reformation. Many who suffered for their faith during that time found solid comfort in Luther's words of faith and praise. "A mighty fortress is our God!" - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton
-----------------
This hymn was sung at the fun­er­al of Amer­i­can pre­si­dent Dwight Ei­sen­how­er at the Na­tion­al Ca­thed­ral in Wash­ing­ton, DC, March 1969.
It may be that General Eisenhower was strengthened by this song during World War II, though he was not religious at that time, but he had Godly parents.</article>

The protestant reformation movement was built on three main tenets:
 1. The re-establishment o the scriptures.
 2. Clarifying the means of salvation.
 3. The restoration of congregational singing.</article>

	<article author="Jo Reitkopp" email="" city="Orange" provst="California" country="United States" month="11" day="13" year="2012">Both the melody and words are beautiful. Martin Luther lived in a terrible time in history where if one did not agree with the King or Queen, he could be beheaded or burned for their faith. God blessed Luther with the boldness to declare the truth of God's Word in a very dangerous time.</article>

	<article author="Adenike Odunuga" email="" city="Abuja" provst="" country="Nigeria" month="3" day="8" year="2007">This song gives a balanced view of the statuses of God, Jesus and Satan. It is childish to underestimate Satan and tragic to underestimate God and Jesus' rulership and dominion over the devil. God wishes us to know His power and likes to reveal himself to us for our good but Satan likes to hide and do as if he does not exist. He masqurades as angel of light. A child of God needs to know the potentials of God and of Satan to be safe.This song clearly states the means by which we can overcome the enemy -Satan, it is through the WORD.The WORD made flesh.</article>
	<article author="amen24" email="" city="Butuan City" provst="" country="Philippines" month="1" day="7" year="2006">God is mighty to our enemy but He is small for us to enjoy, hallelujah. I was touch this song and that is why i like to sing this.... hallelujah</article>
