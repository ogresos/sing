	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="3" day="13" year="2015">George Beverly Shea in "How Sweet the Sound":
When I was 5 years of age, there was an incident at our home in Winchester, Ontario, that my parents liked to recall, especially later when one of their sons became a gospel singer. One Saturday morning we heard a knock at the door. Standing there were 2 gentlemen who planned to hold evangelistic services at our church. Knowing Mother to be a fine pianist, they asked her to help them learn a song they said was new: "The Old Rugged Cross." They wished to sing it as a duet in the morning service. My parents would later tell how I stood by the piano with mouth wide open, listening to the voices of those wonderful singers!
I met the composer of the words and music in 1940 at a Bible conference in Cedar Lake, Indiana. What a joy. Rev. Bennard told us he was the son of a coal miner and would have followed in his father's footsteps had he not been called to become a minister and evangelist.
Asked how he came to write "The Old Rugged Cross," George Bennard told how he was thinking of the cross of Jesus one day. He had been composing music at the piano, and his mind seemed to want to dwell on the death of Christ. Then words came, an inspired answer to his own spiritual quest.
This is said to be the best loved of all 20th-century hymns.
God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. Galatians 6:14
If we ever have any doubts about Jesus' love, all we need to do is recall His willingness to leave "His glory above." He did this, knowing He would face a "dark Calvary" for you and for me. When we cherish the cross, what's most important is cherishing the One who gave His life for us on that old cross because He loved us so much.
The true beauty of the cross is visible only in the divine bloodstains of Jesus described in the 3rd stanza of this song. Even though Jesus knew He would have to endure the cross, He also understood the joy that would follow. One day He will be seated beside God the Father, welcoming those for whom He died (Hebrews 12:2).
How I praise You, Jesus, for the unselfish love that took You to the cross. You are the greatest treasure of all, and I cherish You. When I look at the cross, help me to see Your beauty. You are the Lamb of God, whose sacrifice pardons and cleanses me. I look forward to seeing You when You will be seated beside God the Father, welcoming me!</article>

Thank You Father. (I had a tough day yesterday. My marriage ended in divorce 12 years ago. I was a lonely child and adult. I found out Robin died.  I wonder what he was going through.)
When I was 15 years old I believed my value came from being perfect. To cope with the failure rejection and ridicule that came from trying to be perfect I smoked marijuana and slept a lot. Around that time I heard a Bible teacher say our value came from how God made us and what Jesus did for us on the cross, and if we trusted Him as our king we would receive forgiveness for everything we've ever done and experience true life. Since then I've realized I can't make myself more or less valuable, and that when I trust Jesus enough to follow Him (as my king) I experience true life.
Would you like to trust Jesus as your king so you too can experience true life?</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="3" day="13" year="2014">Bennard was born in Youngstown, OH, but raised in Iowa. Initially he was with the Salvation Army but eventually was ordained by the Methodist Episcopal Church. Here he conducted revival meetings throughout Michigan, NY and Canada. It was during a particular difficult time while he was in Michigan that he reflected on the significance of the cross and what Paul meant when he spoke of entering into the fellowship of Christ's sufferings. The result was this hymn. He wrote other hymns but is known mainly for this one. - Songs of the Spirit by Martin

To the old rugged cross I will ever be true;

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="3" day="24" year="2013">@David of Granger, IN 11/8/2010: The address of the church where this hymn was 1st sung is:
60041 Vermont Street
Pokagon, MI 49120
The hymn sing is the 1st Sunday (not Saturday) evening of each month, May-Sept.

The restoration of this historical church building (basically a barn) is being led by Dr. Melchizedek Ponniah, whose grandfather, the son of a Hindu priest, converted to Christianity in the early 1900's after hearing this song sung at a revival meeting in Tamil Nadu, India.

There is also an Old Rugged Cross museum in Reed City, MI, near George Bennard's home.

I have not been to either of these places yet, but hope to this summer as I live in Michigan.

"The inspiration came to me one day in 1913 when I was staying in Albion, MI. I began to write 'The Old Rugged Cross.' I completed the melody 1st. The words that I first wrote were imperfect. The words of the finished hymn were put into my heart in answer to my own need. Shortly thereafter it was introduced at special meetings in Pokagon, MI on June 7, 1913." - George Bennard

George Bennard had served with the Salvation Army before being ordained in the Methodist Episcopal Church. By this time he was carrying on revival services throughout the Midwest. After it's debut at Pokagon, the song was presented at an evangelistic convention in Chicago. Participants then took it back to their homes throughout the country. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>
