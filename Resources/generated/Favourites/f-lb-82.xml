Syrek" email="" city="Reading" provst="United Kingdom" country="" month="4" day="28" year="2003">Tonight" country="I have been typing an email where I was explaining to a young, seeking brother things and matters related to God's heart desire... I decided to quote this song in its entirety at the end of a lenghty presentation... When I started to type simultaneously listening to the tune something started to grow and expand within me and finally I just couldn't help but burst into tears of repentance and love to the Lord. I can say nothing but "Lord, I love you, I just love you so much..." This song has been giving me many moments like these in the past.

This song touches not only my heart, but I believe strongly, it touches God's heart as well... This song is a universal love story confined within few simple verses yet having the weight of the entire universe, conveying the content of God's eternal economy and the fulfillment of His, our dear Lord's heart desire... In these days when nothing seems certain, nothing seems to be sure - I have a strong and wonderful promise that nothing can change His love for me, to gain me, oh to gain me totally!!! Lord Jesus, come and claim Your Bride!</article>

It tells me that even though we are sinners, Christ pursues us to be His Bride. He died and rose to be life to us, so we may be the same as He, in life and nature, but not in the Godhead. Amen! We must all pursue Christ.</article>
