Often tears are upon my eyes when I sing this song before the Lord. Thank You Lord for dying for us on the cross and purchasing us with Your precious blood. We now belong to Him, He is our master, therefore we need to live not just for Him or by Him but To the Lord who purchased us. Lord Keep us loving You, pursuing You daily and being saturated with You daily to magnify You.</article>

It touches my whole being, it burn my spirit to love the Lord more than everything, it makes me feel that the Lord Jesus inside of me...how wonderful He is. Now I know He is the person whom I am longing for. I love you Lord.</article>

My favorite part of the hymn is "Lord, I really want to know this Person inside of me. Lord, keep my heart open to You." There's a real Person in our being who wants to take over us completely. It can only happen if we turn our face to Him and let the face of our heart behold Him and reflect Him. To turn our heart to Him is not a small matter; rather, it is a colossal matter because it causes us to know this precious Person in our spirit. I REALLY want to know Him, His preferences, His opinions, His way, and His perfect will by turning to Him and keeping my heart open to Him every moment!</article>
