This song came from a hymn book called Christ in Song don't know if it still is around. It is a wonderful hymn book with lots of old hymn's including this one.</article>

Theodore Monod was a French Protestant Pastor who initially studied law but then trained for the ministry at Western Theological Seminary in Alleghany, PA. From 1860 - 1863 he labored among the French Canadians in Illinois. He returned to Paris and his father’s pastorate in 1875. He was a popular speaker at the Keswick Camp meetings. Among the books he wrote are "Looking To Jesus", "The Christian's Cross", "Life More Abundant" and "The Gift of God". Some of his sermons are on the internet. - path2prayer
Mo­nod wrote the words of this song, in Eng­lish, dur­ing a ser­ies of con­se­cra­tion meet­ings in Broad­lands, Hamp­shire, Eng­land, in July 1874. At the close of the meet­ings, he gave them to Lord Mount-Tem­ple, who had them print­ed on a prog­ram card for a ser­ies of sim­i­lar meet­ings at Ox­ford in Oc­to­ber 1874. - cyberhymnal

The following is his sharing on Hebrews 8:10-12
We all need two conversions. First of all, we need to be converted from the natural man to the spiritual man, and in the second place, we need to be converted from the spiritual man to the natural man, until the spiritual man becomes a natural life, and the burden is opportunity and the bondage is delight.</article>

I want to comment that I am a young person &amp; using old terms like "thee" does not take away any meaning for me. Please share with young people :)</article>
	<article author="Pamela McLay-Hendeson" email="pjmclayhenderson@gmail.com" city="Melbourne" provst="Victoria" country="Australia" month="11" day="12" year="2014">Dear Katie, (Warragul Vic) et al.
I am an experienced teacher and I could not agree more with you!</article>
	<article author="Anonymous" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="9" day="25" year="2014">To follow up on what Katie has mentioned, linguistically speaking, "Thee" is actually the informal way of saying "You." Overtime, the English language has kept the formal and dropped the informal. But this just shows how close we are to the Lord, and what a friend He is to us!</article>
	<article author="Katie Peken" email="kpeken@gmail.com" city="Warragul" provst="Vic" country="Australia" month="12" day="13" year="2013">There is not much in this that young people can't understand. I suggest a quick explanation, that this song was written a long time ago by someone who loved Jesus as much as we do today, and back then a person talking to one other person called them 'thee' instead of 'you'. We mutilate a lot of beautiful hymns in the name of making them accessible, often the result changes the very theology not to mention disrespecting the hymn writer's intentions. I think younger people are more able to accommodate than we give them credit for being. And after all, you and I can understand 'thee', but it hasn't been in use in our lifetime either!</article>
	<article author="Dowsa" email="conductor@naracoorteuca.org.au" city="Naracoorte" provst="South Australia" country="Australia" month="11" day="25" year="2013">It's a terrific song, but we have made a commitment to avoid using words that don't make sense to younger people. We would never use the word 'Thee'... Does anybody know of an updated version of this song, rewritten for people of this era?

Lord thank You for Your mercy and Your grace.</article>
	<article author="Denis Ladbrook" email="denisladbrook@gmail.com" city="Wembley Downs" provst="Western Australia" country="Australia" month="9" day="8" year="2013">The movement from verse 1 to verse 4 of this hymn is, among other things, the most profound suicide-prevention policy in the world. Please make it yours.</article>

	<article author="Frank Pytel" email="" city="Chicago" provst="Illinois" country="United States" month="2" day="23" year="2011">It takes about three minutes to sing this song through, but I wonder how long it takes to get from verse one to verse four in my experience.
What will it take for Him to be all in all?</article>
	<article author="Salvador Z. Tarun, Jr." email="" city="Pittsburgh" provst="Pa" country="United States" month="11" day="10" year="2010">A hymn of Christ's love, mercy, grace ---'words fitly spoken, like apples of gold in settings of silver' (Proverbs 25:11). I deeply treasure this hymn. Thank you for making this song available to all of God's children.</article>
