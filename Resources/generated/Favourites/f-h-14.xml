Lord I know this is not what You called us to do my heart is sore I was one of them I ask for your forgiveness.They are ppl, You created them as You have created us. We are no better than them but we just keep on firing on them for no reason and stand tall like goliath instead of drawing them to You. Today make us what You called us here to spread the gospel (good news) That there is hope in You oh Lord. We are all sinners infront of Your eyes, we are no better .Give us all the spirit of obedience in Jesus name, Amen.</article>

INSPIRATIONAL 
This Song Brings Back Memories Of Sunday Schooling;
Back Then My Parents Encouraged Me In A "Disciplinarian" Way To Attend Sunday School üè´ 
Reading üìñ And Singing üé∂ Hymns, Digesting The Word Of GOD, Are One Of The Very Many Things We Do
BUT NOW I SEE THE BENEFITS OF KNOWING CHRIST THEN, HAS SET A "ROCK SOLID" FOUNDATION, WHICH NOW MAKES ME:
*FEARLESS IN SUFFERINGS, TORTURE etc
*MORE THAN A CONQUEROR IN CHRIST
This Is Why The Scripture Says:
"BRING UP YOUR CHILDREN IN THE WAY OF THE LORD AND THEY SHALL NOT DEPART FROM IT"
PROVERB 22:6
‚ÄúTrain up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it‚Äù
THE WISDOM IMPERTED THEN {over 30 years ago} IS STILL HELPING ME DEAL WITH A "HATEFUL" WORLD
"WEAPONS OF OUR WARFARE" HAS HELPED ME DEAL WITH ALL FORMS OF "CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY"
"FRUITS OF THE SPIRIT" HAS HELPED ME IN HUMILITY AND HOW TO LOVE THOSE WHO CONTINUE TO SHOW HATRED
"SONGS &amp; HYMNS" HAS HELPED ME TO SING PRAISES TO MY "ANCIENT OF DAYS" AND GIVING HIM THE HIGHEST PRAISE, HALLELUJAH üôå</article>
