Now my heart its love and praises render,
 Tasting all the sweetness of Thy name.

We refuse to have nothing else but You. Lord we want to come back to our first love. Oh Lord Jesus save us moment by moment. We refuse to go back. We never go back to Babylon. O Lord we want to have a more subjective experience of You. The pathway may be drear but Lord we accept and move on only through You. Lord Jesus we cry out to You because we need You. You give us the radiancy to shine. You empower us to live a normal life. We are not alone, we have the Body, the saints, our dear brothers and sisters. Lord Jesus we yearn to see Thee face to face. We recognize our offering is not adequate, but Lord accept our offering.</article>

	<article author="Tom Smith" email="" city="Lake Forest" provst="California" country="United States" month="4" day="16" year="2012">This hymn shows how the beginning of love in us toward the Lord is a vision of His wonderful person. I especially enjoy the part in stanza 2 that says, "Lord when first I saw Thee in Thy splendor...Now my heart its love and praises render." It's only by seeing the excellency of Christ that we can love Him, even with the best love.</article>

When I sing this song, to me a prayer, I am subdued by the One, who Loved the greatest, with the sole desire that I may enter into that love, and Live!!!!! Yes live, and of a truth until you have tasted and seen that the Lord is Good, you have not lived.</article>

	<article author="Ed" email="" city="Fremont" provst="California" country="United States" month="7" day="16" year="2009">What beauty captures the human heart? All of creation is only but a shadow of the great Creator, and even then, one cannot fully know him without His word and His light. This beauty that captivates us, moves us, and turns our gloom to song, is not outward physical beauty that we can see with our eyes, but our Lord Jesus. Look away unto Him – not with these human eyes that are so easily corrupted – but with the eyes of our human spirit.

A blind sister loved the Lord Jesus and pursued Him with her whole heart. She received treatment for her eyes and immediately gained her sight. Yet as soon she saw how terrible this world had corrupted from original creation, she sought for her blindness once more.
A dear brother took a bus to reach a certain destination. As he sat on the bus, he saw many things pass by him outside the bus, and he grieved at the world situation. When he got off the bus at his stop, he realized, his spirit was dead, and he was full of the feeling of deadness.

This world has no true beauty to offer man. Temptations and traps laid by the evil One ensnare us and cause us to pursue earthly things. We are often drawn away and drift from Him who saved us. Yet, if we pray for the Lord for blessed blindness, if we glance at the Savior, if we simply turn to Him, all other things fade away. Nothing can come in comparison to his beauty; we must believe this.

Generations of brothers and sisters who followed the Lord throughout Church history have “wasted” their lives before the Lord. Those in the world see such sacrifice as a waste of golden futures and prosperous riches. These ones, who “waste” their lives away to seek the Lord, drawn by his beauty, who pursue him, these are the ones who have laid for themselves treasures in the heavens. Like them, I want to “waste” myself upon the Lord. At first, it grieves me and causes me to weep to lose the things I hold on to in this world. But then, I realize, nothing I give to the Lord, my time, my belongings, my achievements, my heart is not a loss to me, but gains; It is a freedom and a joy to have the Lord alone. All I have, I offer to the Lord, knowing it is nothing, expecting nothing in return except for the Lord Himself to saturate and fill my entire being.</article>
	<article author="Livingstone" email="" city="China" provst="Zhe Jiang" country="" month="5" day="6" year="2009">This song is my favorite. Every time singing it makes me satisfied, brings me to this lovely Person-Jesus. Jesus loves me without measurement, how could I measure the depth of His love! just stop everything to enjoy Him. this love is actually Himself. The more love the more Christ Himself, I long to be immersed in this love forever. Lord Jesus, I love You! Nothing and no one in this universe is valuable to us to pay attention to. How much we need to be filled with You!</article>

	<article author="Jason" email="" city="Miami" provst="FL" country="United States" month="4" day="10" year="2008">A dear sister from our locality recently passed away, and this was one of her favorite songs. As we sang this song at her memorial service, I was overwhelmed by the love our dear sister had for the Lord and for the saints. This is song certainly her testimony. Oh, Lord Jesus! Not alone do I adore Thee, but with all the saints as Thy dear Bride! Lord Jesus, quickly come! Our love is waiting for Thee. And Thou wilt be satisfied!</article>

	<article author="Filip S. Syrek" email="" city="Reading" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="9" day="30" year="2002">This song is one of my favourite hymns. I find it so sweet and personal yet very much Body-oriented... The experience of Christ as such an attracting and beautiful One brings a lot more appreciation of this wonderful Person! He is the One to whom we are being attracted and drawn day by day as we go on enjoying Him in His sweetness. And He is the only One we seek after... What a precious and intimate Christ we have!!!</article>
	<article author="Stephanie Smith" email="" city="Redding" provst="CA" country="U.S.A." month="9" day="15" year="2002">I am 12 years old and I like this song because it makes me feel great. I like it when I am in church and we (the church) get to sing 1159. It just brings joy to everyone in that room. The thing I like the most about this song is the words. I think the words make you relax.</article>
	<article author="" email="" city="Toronto" provst="ON" country="Canada" month="9" day="10" year="2002">Each time I sing this song, I'm once again captured by the beauty of the Lord and my love for Him is renewed. When I'm in love with the Lord, I feel like I can just open my whole heart to Him! I want to be constantly reminded about how great it is to love Him in such a pure way. Too many times, I get caught up in my mind and feel like I need to do many things for Him. But coming to this song I realize that sometimes I just need to forget about all religious duty and to just enjoy remaining in His presence each moment simply because He is such a wonderful Person and so worthy to be loved. Spontaneously, as I love Him, I am filled by Him and what He desires becomes so clear to me.

Matthew 5:8 says "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God." Loving the Lord with a pure heart enables us to see Him clearly. It's so true that in my experience, when I love the Lord and care for His interest, the 'sky' above becomes so clear because I realize that He's the One on the throne, that He's sovereign and He's wise and as long as He's in control, everything will be all right. Furthermore, seeing this wonderful Person washes away all of my self. I can just praise Him because He's so wonderful and whenever something comes up, I just turn to Him by calling on His name, "O Lord Jesus!"

As our love for Him grows, He becomes so precious to us that we are willing to pour out so much on Him. Just like Mary who poured out costly ointment from an alabaster flask to anoint the Lord Jesus, we would be able to give up what is precious to us because we've realized that He's much better! In my experience this could be small things like our time and our education to consecrating our whole life to Him. The Lord is so lovely and so worthy that the sacrifices we have to make are but small in comparison to the satisfaction we gain from loving Him.

Eventually, it will be our love for the Lord that will bring Him back. As lovers of the Lord, we are built up with the other saints to become the Bride of Christ. May He be satisfied with our love and what we have to offer to Him that He can come back quickly! "Dear Lord, draw us and attract us to Yourself each day. May we flee all youthful lusts and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on You out of a pure heart. We desire to love You with such a pure heart that satisfies your heart's desire and brings you back."</article>
