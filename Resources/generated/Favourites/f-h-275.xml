The original hymn is quite different and does not have a chorus:
------------------------
1 Thy Holy Spirit, Lord, alone,
 Can turn our hearts from sin;
 His power alone can sanctify
 And keep us pure within.
--------------------
2 Thy Holy Spirit, Lord, alone
 Can deeper love inspire;
 His power alone within our souls
 Can light the sacred fire.
-------------------------
3 Thy Holy Spirit, Lord, can bring
 The gifts we seek in prayer;
 His voice can words of comfort speak,
 And still each wave of care.
----------------------
4 Thy Holy Spirit, Lord, can give
 The grace we need this hour;
 And while we wait, O Spirit, come
 In sanctifying power.</article>
