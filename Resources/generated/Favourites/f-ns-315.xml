I was touched to take the Nazarite vow to consecrate my being to the Lord. From this day forward, I will not partake of the product of grapes or cut my hair. Dear saints, I ask that you hold me to this word! Ecclesiastes 5:5 says "It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay."</article>

	<article author="Andrea" email="dreeanderson@gmail.com" city="Washington" provst="DC" country="United States" month="11" day="2" year="2013">I love this song! I also never knew there were four verses- only used to the first 2. I was touched this time that The Lord will not return until we take Him as our King. Each day we need to enthrone Him in our thoughts, actions, and in our being. We need to lay the tracks and fear offending Him, really fear doing anything to lose His presence. Oh Lord we are not absolute. Make us Your absolute ones!</article>
