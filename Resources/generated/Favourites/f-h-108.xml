	<article author="Innocent" email="" city="Port Harcourt" provst="" country="Nigeria" month="6" day="12" year="2015">When we imagine the contradiction our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ suffered in our hands before and at the cross we see Divine Love demonstrated. So much love rewarded with intense rejection and hatred. But love conquered, divine mercy triumphed over deserved judgement. Hallelujah! what a Savior!</article>

	<article author="Barbara Hobbs" email="" city="Kojonup" provst="WA" country="Australia" month="3" day="31" year="2014">I am using this hymn this Sunday when our congregation will be concentrating on the rejection, bullying, injustice and being abandoned by many that Jesus encountered during Holy Week. We tend to concentrate on the suffering on the Cross - but Jesus suffered all that we suffer in our daily lives - so fully understands our suffering. Truly the Son of Man - as He called Himself as well as the Son of God.</article>

	<article author="Michael" email="" city="San Gabriel" provst="CA" country="United States" month="9" day="29" year="2013">As I was meditating on I John 3:16 - "Â  In this we know love, that He laid down His life on our behalf, and we ought to lay down our lives on behalf of the brother." - this song came to mind! What a wonderful Savior! As we look and consider what He did in laying down His life for us, "we know love." May the Spirit continue to teach us and lead us into full understanding and knowledge of His love - His laying "down His life on our behalf."</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="4" day="19" year="2013">Paul Bliss was one of the most prominent hymnwriters in the heyday of gospel hymnwriting. Bliss grew up working on a farm and in lumber camps, but eventually became a music teacher. He sold his 1st song at age 26 and later worked for a hymn publisher. D. L. Moody urged Bliss to become a singing evangelist, and so he did beginning in 1874. This hymn was published in 1875. In 1876, while traveling through Ohio, Bliss and his family were involved in a train wreck. Reportedly, Bliss went back into the fiery train to save his wife, but they both died. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>

	<article author="Steve" email="steveaa@gmail.com" city="Minneapolis" provst="MN" country="United States" month="12" day="15" year="2012">While street preaching, I often sing this song to the multitudes. It's my all-time favorite song!

Matthew 9 
 36 But when he (Jesus) saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.
 (KJV)

For a wonderfully inspiring impact, go up a partial octave on each stanza, and build to a great crescendo on the final stanza. Simply beautiful!</article>
