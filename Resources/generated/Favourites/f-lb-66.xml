	<article author="J H" email="jason709394@hotmail.com" city="" provst="" country="Canada" month="1" day="7" year="2013">In relation to the first two lines of the last verse: "One little turn and You were there, waiting for me with Your loving care."

The point here is this: the Savior knows where the sinner is. He knows the sinner's true situation. The Lord Jesus went to the well, sent all of His disciples away, and sat by the well, waiting until the woman came. If you look back into your salvation, you will realize that, to some extent at least, the same principle was operating. You did not go to heaven - the Lord came to you. He came down to the very place where you were. I was born in China, but the Lord Jesus went there. One day He was waiting for me at a certain place, and I was caught by Him. What about you? You did not go to meet the Savior, did you? The Savior came to you. Some have been saved as a result of an automobile accident. Nevertheless, they must realize that before the accident occurred, the Lord Jesus was already waiting to meet them. We all were saved in this way. This is marvelous.

ĐK: Vì cớ sao chết thế tôi, Kẻ từng chống nghịch con Trời? Vì Tôi Chúa chịu làm nên rủa sả. 
Ồ quá cao sâu tuyệt vời! Chúa Trời chết thay con người, Dù Tôi đã thù nghịch Ngài Chúa ôi.
Tình Chúa chinh phục chính Tôi, Kẻ từng chống nghịch Con Trời, Tìm tôi với một tình yêu vô đối.
Điều đã khiến tôi đỗi thay, chính tình ái xót thương này. Tình yêu bắt phục, tình yêu lớn thay!

2. Lòng Ngài đầy mến yêu vô bờ, Dịu dàng và đầy thương xót, lòng này đâu ngờ. Ô sao Jesus yêu kẻ như tôi từng là tội nhân, Dù cho Tôi chống nghịch Ngài bao lần.

3. Lòng Ngài hằng trìu mến tôi lâu rồi, Tình Ngài nồng nàn tha thiết trường tồn muôn đời. Tuy tôi bao năm xa cách, chỉ xem thường Ngài, từng gièm chê, Ngài cầu thay, vẫn mong chờ tôi về.</article>
	<article author="Indiara" email="" city="London" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="3" day="23" year="2011">This hymn touches me profoundly. It exposes our condition before the Lord gained us, we were His enemies. But such a mysterious love constrain us and there is nothing more we can do but surrender to the Lord Jesus. Amazing LOVE, GRACE and MERCY for all!
"If a man has committed a sin deserving of death, and he is put to death and you hang him on a tree, his body shall not remain overnight on the tree, but you shall surely bury him that day, so that you do not defile the land which the Lord your God is giving you as a inheritance; for he who is hanged is accursed of God." (Deuteronomy 21:22-23) Jesus Christ on that cross was accursed for us, He died on our place, so let's all in one accord give praises to the Almighty God for His ultimate sacrifice for us on that tree. JESUS CHRIST IS LORD!!!</article>

O, we were once sinners. We rebelled, even mocked and cursed Him. But only His great, great love and His mercy could change us. He died for us, His enemy, and even saved us!

These words continually encourage and supply me every single day. The Lord speaks these words to me in every situation I face. We all need to be constantly reminded that all it takes is ONE LITTLE TURN and He is there waiting to care for us. All it takes is that one little turn and He is able to work Himself into us more. This is all He requires of us, to be open and to turn to Him in every situation. Praise the Lord, He does the rest!</article>
