	<article author="Gareth Sinclair" email="gsinclair777@gmail.com" city="Rugby" provst="Warwickshire" country="United Kingdom" month="5" day="9" year="2015">This ministry, the Apostles ministry is truly, truly anointed. 
I am brought so close, so intimate with the Lord. 
The hymns are so beautiful, so full of Scriptural truth and life. 
I am so touched when I read the comments written by saints who are so obviously enjoying Christ as Life! What is so pleasurable is that I know that God is pleased. Isn't our salvation wonderful brothers and sisters?
I love You Lord Jesus. 
We will all meet face to face one fine day in the presence of The King of Kings. 
Bless you all.</article>

I really enjoy how it is not us that need to become better people in order for God to come, but that we should let God move our will and direct our way. Praise the Lord that we can go out to all of the earth to boast of our precious salvation!</article>

	<article author="Lovely Granada" email="" city="General Santos City" provst="" country="Philippines" month="6" day="7" year="2003">I was really impressed of this song even of its title. I am 13. Of my very young age, this hymn made me realize that God really loves me. God loved me for even before the foundation of the world, He had chosen me. In His humanity He died on the cross, was buried, resurrected and became the life-giving Spirit that I may have His life and live Him. He is now the processed Triune God who can dwell in me.  He made Himself humble and closer to me. AMEN.</article>
	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="26" year="2008">The fifth step is the turning. For example, after the remembrance of the Lord, we need to turn to worship the Father. Sometimes the Lord's table has not reached the point of worshipping the Father, but a brother selects Hymns, #33; sometimes a brother selects Hymns, #101 immediately after the bread and the cup have been passed. Both are inappropriate. Hence, there is the need of a sixth step for correction. Sometimes a meeting may be quite long. For example, when a great number of saints gather together, it may take a longer time for the bread and the cup to be passed. If this is the case, there may be the need to maintain the spirit through a hymn or some prayers. This is the seventh step, maintaining the spirit for the meeting. Even though we use hymns and prayers to maintain the spirit, there may still be the need to fill up the time with more prayers and singing. This is the eighth step. Then toward the end of the meeting comes the ninth step to sing a concluding hymn. Sometimes even though the meeting has ended, there is still a lingering air; thus, we may select another hymn to send the saints off. This is the tenth step. This can be compared to sending off a friend who has visited you by walking a distance with him.
