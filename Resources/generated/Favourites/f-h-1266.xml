Christ and the burning church! It is not Christ and the word, hay and stubble church. 

It is Christ and the burning, shining, golden lampstand church in this age, which age is the church age.

Christ and the burning church my home sweet home, where the brothers are strong in Christ, and the sisters are strong in Christ, and all you see is Christ, Christ, Christ. 

Yes, in the burning church, Christ in us, burning, shining, shining, shining ....building us up together in love. 

Christ and the shining church. Shining, shining...New Jerusalem shining!!!</article>

    <article author="lea aldiano" email="" city="mandaue city" provst="cebu" country="phils." month="2" day="18" year="2008">1  Burning, burning, we are burning, ever to our spirits turning, One for Thine eternal purpose, in spirit one; On the ground of locality, We express our unity - Many members, but one Body, Christ as our Head.

Christ and the local church,
Christ and the local church,
Christ and the church, our reality and life, Hallelujah, Hallelujah!
Lord, we've given our lives to You, For the building of Your Body, For the building up in love.

2 Breathing, breathing, we are breathing, With each breath new life receiving, What a transformation from the old to the new;
Breathing out the old life from us, Breathing in new life and oneness, We are breathing in of Jesus, we are breathing in of life.</article>
