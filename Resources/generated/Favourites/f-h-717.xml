	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="28" year="2008">Once you sing like this, your coldness will turn to zeal, your deadness will turn to life, your weakness will turn to strength, and your sorrow will turn to joy. Therefore, you should memorize the hymns thoroughly. At the same time, you need to be filled within. If there is no filling, there will be no overflow.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="24" year="2008">As we enjoy this hymn, it is as refreshing as eating ice cream, especially for the older brothers and sisters when they come to verse 3:

O let us rejoice in the Lord evermore,
When sickness upon us is stealing,
No cordial like gladness our strength can restore,
For joy is the fountain of healing.

As you fellowship with the Lord this way, you may say to the Lord, "No cordial like gladness my strength can restore, for joy is the fountain of healing." Then you will surely have a desireâ€”"I will go to the meeting."
