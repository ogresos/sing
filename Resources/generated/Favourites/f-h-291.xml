	<article author="Jumoke Smith" email="jumokesmith1@gmail.com" city="Newark" provst="NJ" country="United States" month="5" day="17" year="2016">This song was composed by the inspiration of The Holy Spirit.
The same way The Holy Spirit inspired me to sing it this morning as an assurance for me that Jesus loves me and my children and "Nothing" can separate us from the Unconditional Love of Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior. 
He has promised "Never to leave us nor forsake us"
This is the assurance we have that indeed " It is well with us "
THANK YOU JESUS!</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="4" day="14" year="2016">I think it was in June, 1870, that “Jesus Loves Even Me” was written. Mr. and Mrs. Bliss were at that time members of my family, at 43 South May street, Chicago [Illinois]. One morning, Mrs. Bliss came down to breakfast and said, as she entered the room: Last night Mr. Bliss had a tune given to him that I think is going to live and be one of the most used that he has written. I have been singing it all morning to myself and cannot get it out of my mind. She then sang over to us the notes of “Jesus Loves Me”. The idea of Bliss in writing it was that the peace and comfort of a Christian were not founded his loving Christ, but upon Christ’s love to him, and that to occupy the mind with Christ’s love, would produce love and consecration…How much God has used this little song to lead sinners and doubting Christians to look away to Jesus, eternity alone can tell. - 'Memoirs of Philip P. Bliss' by Daniel Webster Whittle
-------------------
Mr. Bliss said that this song was suggested to him by hearing the chorus of the hymn 'Oh, how I love Jesus', repeated very frequently in a meeting which he attended. After joining in the chorus a number of times the thought came to him, Have I not been singing enough about my poor love for Jesus, and shall I not rather sing of his great love for me? Under the impulse of this thought he went home and composed this, one of his most popular children’s hymns. - 'My Life and the Story of the Gospel Hymns' by Ira David Sankey
----------------
There are 3 additional stanzas:
4. Jesus loves me, and I know I love Him;
Love brought Him down my poor soul to redeem;
Yes, it was love made Him die on the tree;
Oh, I am certain that Jesus loves me!
------------
5. If one should ask of me, how can I tell?
Glory to Jesus, I know very well!
God’s Holy Spirit with mine doth agree,
Constantly witnessing Jesus loves me.
------------
6. In this assurance I find sweetest rest,
Trusting in Jesus, I know I am blessed;
Satan, dismayed, from my soul now doth flee,
When I just tell him that Jesus loves me.</article>
