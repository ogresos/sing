	<article author="Sis LC" email="" city="" provst="" country="New Zealand" month="10" day="23" year="2009">It is so sweet to hear this song again. the Song of Songs is truely a portrait of the believers' experience in Christ.

There was a period of time this year when I was singing this song over and over again. It was after a very dark period of time. It was my lowest valley, but the Lord drew me away. He told me to rise up, He called me 'my love', I was to Him the 'beautiful one'. He told me to come away. He told me that winter is past. Really, Lord? Has winter really past? He reassured me, again and again, that winter is past, the rain is over and gone.
 
I couldn't believe how the Lord loved me. After hating myself so much for what's been going on, after seeing how ugly I am and how disobedient I am, the Lord told me to come away. He didn't condemn me for what was going on. He just told me to come away. My Beloved is really sweet. He shepherded my soul in a very gentle way.

I learnt not to despise my low valleys. I will not question again whether that experience was necessary. It was a dark time. I was hopelessly veiled, and seemingly I have lost the Lord's presence. But also because of that the Lord became close to me. It was in this valley that the Lord became so sweet.</article>

	<article author="Jenny" email="" city="" provst="" country="Malaysia" month="6" day="17" year="2009">The Lord is encouraging us, in His appreciation of us, to rise up and come out of our low situation (our introspection of the self) to be with Him. The time of dormancy (winter) and  trials (rain) is over and the time of resurrection (spring) is coming. Oh, rise up and come away! (Footnotes from RcV)</article>
