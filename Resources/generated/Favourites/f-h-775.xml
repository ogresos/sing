	<article author="C. L." email="" city="Toronto" provst="Ontario" country="Canada" month="6" day="2" year="2010">Praise the Lord! We have the mighty name of our Lord Jesus in us! I've enjoyed this portion - (excerpt from HWMR "The Prayer of the Age" Week 4 â€“ Day 3 pp. 68-69; reference: Watchman Nee, The Prayer Ministry of the Church pp. 49-52, 55-59):

"The Lord is bold enough to commit His name to our hand, and He is allowing us to use this name. The Lord trusts us to the extent that He dares to commit His name to our hands and allow us to use this name. This is the meaning of being in the name of the Lord Jesus. Being in the name of the Lord means that the Lord Jesus has given Himself to us and that He is willing to acknowledge everything that we do in His name. He is willing to bear all the consequences of us doing things in His name. 

Today He has ascended to the heavens and is sitting on the right hand of the Father, waiting for the enemy to be His footstool. He is there as the High Priest, and He is praying there. This is His job. As to His work on earth, He has committed it to the church. Therefore, the church has the authority to use His name today. Consequently, the Lord has to take responsibility for the church's use of His name." Amen!</article>

(The best way to touch the Lord Jesus, to enjoy the Lord Jesus, to share something of the Lord Jesus, is not to say very much, but to go to the Lord and call, "Jesus! Jesus! Lord Jesus!" call on the name of Jesus and you will taste something.) Life-study of Matt.</article>
