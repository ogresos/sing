Praise the Lord!
"How wonderful to have Him as our Paraclete: In Greek, parakletos denotes someone alongside who takes care of our cause, our affairs. It is composed of two words: a preposition that means with and a form of the word for call. In ancient times a paraclete was a HELPER, ADVOCATE, COUNSEL, or INTERCESSOR. A paraclete is someone who served a particular person by taking care of his needs. As one who is always present, a paraclete may be considered a WAITER, a helper, and also an ATTORNEY. In a note on John 14:16 Darby says that a paraclete was “one who carries on the cause of any one and helps him.” In his translation of 1 John 2:1, where the same Greek word is used, Darby says that we have a “patron” with the Father. Then in a note he explains that he uses the word patron in the sense of the Roman patron, who maintained the interests of his clients in every way. We may say that the Spirit today is our PATRON. He is with us to take care of our entire situation.
