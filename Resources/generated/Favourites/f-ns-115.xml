	<article author="Jason" email="" city="Houston" provst="TX" country="United States" month="11" day="9" year="2009">When I was a younger brother in the Lord, the brother that brought me into the church life taught me this song. Little did I know that this song was one of the few things the Lord used to keep me. I fell away for 15 years only to come back home and continue to run the race and pursue righteousness out of faith. In my dark time away from the Body the Lord used this song to keep my heart soft so it can be used only for His purpose. God became a man so that man might enter into the joy, rest, and the expression of divinity. What a God we have that sent His only begotten Son into the restriction of human-living and the suffering of the cross. The cross is only a bad thing if you are eating of the wrong tree. Pray that the Lord would keep you close to His heart so that the cross would always be a blessing to you. Praise the Lord we have such a God. We now can be one with Him in life, essence, and partake of the full enjoyment of His divinity.</article>

	<article author="Dora Yao" email="" city="Long Island" provst="New York" country="United States" month="2" day="20" year="2009">Yes! Good morning Lord Jesus!!! Thank You for a new day...thank You we can pray and give thanks. Your mercy is new every morning.  Such a simple song...so renewing to sing first thing in the morning.  We need to humble ourselves to the mind of a child to love the Lord in a simple way. Sometimes we make turning to the Lord so complicated!  When we sometimes just need to say - thank You Lord! Thank You for my spirit! Thank You I can pray! To You, I love to sing!</article>
