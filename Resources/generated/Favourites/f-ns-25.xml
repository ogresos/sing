	<article author="Tom Smith" email="tom@holdingtotruth.com" city="Lake Forest" provst="Ca" country="United States" month="12" day="7" year="2013">This short spiritual song is awesome! It's simple in experience--telling the Lord we love Him, we're attracted and charmed by Him, and that calling on His name makes us satisfied. Yet, it is so profound in its revelation--Christ's riches are unsearchable, we're joined and mingled with Him in a divine-human incorporation, as a foretaste of the holy city, New Jerusalem. May we see that our simple moment by moment enjoyment of this unsearchably rich Christ is ushering us into this awesome incorporation that fulfills God's purpose and makes us the holy city for eternity.</article>
