1 Chron. 29:16 O Jehovah our God, as for all this abundance that we have prepared for building You a house for Your holy name, it is from Your hand, and all is Yours.</article>
	<article author="A. B. L." email="alvinboazleong@yahoo.com" city="Manila" provst="Metro Manila" country="Philippines" month="7" day="7" year="2016">1 Chron. 21:18, 24; 2 Chron. 3:1; 1 Chron. 22:5, 14, 19; 28:20; 29:1-3, 5-9, 14, 16
"...I will surely buy it for the full price, for I will not...offer up burnt offerings that cost me nothing." (1 Chron. 21:24)
"...the house that is to be built to Jehovah must be exceedingly great in fame and glory throughout all lands; I will therefore make preparations for it..." (1 Chron. 22:5)
For the threshing floor where the temple eventually stood (2 Chron. 3:1), David paid the full price. For the house that was eventually filled with God's glory (1 Kings 8:10), David prepared in abundance (1 Chron. 22:5) and gave all (1 Chron. 29:3). Like him, may we have such a spirit that we will not offer offerings that cost us nothing; and for the house that must be great in glory, we too will therefore make preparations in abundance, and give our all!
Like him, we have to pay the full price. The price may be big, or it may be small; but what's important is, it has to be the full price. Like him. we too must prepare, even in affliction (1 Chron. 22:14). We have to be willing to give our private treasures (1 Chron. 29:3). It could be our ease, our, wealth, our time, our strength, our future, our love. Whatever it be, Lord, we willingly consecrate (1 Chron. 29:5) because we set our affection on the house of our God (1 Chron. 29:3). We now set our heart and soul, even our body, to seek after You, and arise and build (1 Chron. 22:19)!
The work is really great because the palace is not for man but for God. (1 Chron 29:1) However, we should all be strong, be bold and build, not be afraid or dismayed, for our God is with us until the completion of all the work for the service of the house (1 Chron. 28:20)!
Lord, like David and the people, we know that it is You who've strengthened us to offer so willingly; for all are from You, and from Your hand we have given to You (1 Chron. 29:14). Now we rejoice, for with our whole heart we've offered all to You!
"...the people rejoiced... for with their whole heart they offered willingly to Jehovah..." (1 Chron. 29:9)</article>

Of whate’er on Thee we’d bestow?
All’s from Thee; from Thine hand we give them back,
Borrowed treasures returning most gladly."
