The more I get into the lyrics, the more I can sense the deep feelings of the author, a true Nazarite. No more wandering in the wilderness, because He has revealed His dream to us! We seek, love, and pursue the Lord, voluntarily consecrating ourselves to Him, living in the reality of His dream by abiding in the vine (Jn. 15:4-5), allowing His transforming life to flow in and through us, even through His sanctifying Word. May we continually offer ourselves on the altar to be burnt as a satisfying fragrance to Him, and be reduced to ashes so that His dream will be realized through us! Praise the Lord!</article>
