Who will deliver us from the body of this death! Hallelujah! Jesus shed His blood for us. Now He is our life our portion measureless.
Could we ever stop thanking the Lord for what He has gained and obtained for us? Never! From eternity to eternity we would love Him! What a precious One!</article>
    <article author="Frank Pytel" email="" city="Chicago" provst="Illinois" country="United States" month="7" day="5" year="2010">This hymn brings out the sorrow and pain we have in the war in Romans 7, and the longing to be released. We all make mistakes in our actions, and the blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin. Yet here we are captives to something within that is stronger than ourselves. It seems like we can never find freedom in certain areas, even after repeated struggles to be right. This situation can last for years! Romans 7:7-25 uses "I" (27 times), "me" (12 times), "my" (5 times), and "myself" (1 time)to describe all my resources. Christ is only mentioned at the end of the struggle (v.25), wih no mention of the Spirit. How wonderful when Christ is revealed! It is "through Jesus Christ our Lord" (7:25)! It is "in Christ Jesus" (8:1)! It is "Christ in you" (8:10)! "All my trust and all my hope is in Jesus Christ my King!"</article>
