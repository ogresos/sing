	<article author="Chioma" email="ckagomo@yahoo.com" city="Lagos" provst="" country="Nigeria" month="5" day="19" year="2015">I learnt this song as a primary school pupil in my local dialect - Igbo- in the early 1960s. It had such an impact on me, just knowing that it was for me that Jesus came and died. Tonight, I decided to look up the English version online. oh what joy to know even at 64, that this song, whether sung in my native tongue or in English, has not lost its power. What joy, it will be to sing it at my Saviour' s feet, when I see Him face to face. O how wonderful, my blessed Saviour came seeking for me.</article>
	<article author="Kenneth Brandie" email="" city="Aberdeen" provst="Aberdeenshire" country="" month="1" day="19" year="2015">This song reminds me of an old saint who was a great example to me. On her deathbed dying with Cancer, covered in bed sores and her bones protruding from her, she was belting out "Oh it is wonderful blest be His name..."
This always comes to mind when I hear extreme prosperity, health wealth preachers saying stupid things like "if you have sickness you lack faith!" 
My friend in her dying hours exhibited a stronger faith and a closeness to God I have never seen before! She is now in that place where there is no sickness, tears, sorrow or death. I guess she'll be singing this one at the feet of her wonderful Saviour! "Oh it is wonderful, how can it be? Dying for me for me"</article>
	<article author="John" email="" city="Kuala Lumpur" provst="" country="Malaysia" month="7" day="6" year="2012">This is the song that my late father taught his young sister in Kerala India in the early 20th century. I was born in Malaysia in the 1950s and had never met my aunt. I heard this song for the first time, from my aunt when I visited Canada in 1980's with my mum to see my uncle. My aunt came from New York with her son who had migrated to New York to see us. My aunt impressed me of my father by singing this song that she had learnt from him as a young girl. She passed away recently aged 100 years old and would sing this song frequently in perfect English. The amazing thing about is that, she could not speak a word of English and yet she as an old woman, could still sing this song very well in good English, just as my father had taught that young girl all those years ago.

To me this is truly the power of God in this song!</article>
	<article author="Thomas Owende" email="" city="Winnipeg" provst="Manitoba" country="Canada" month="5" day="13" year="2011">This song came to my mind today when I recalled it was a Set Piece song for Music Competition for Primary Schools in Kenya in the late sixties. I was not in the main choir but in the Junior Choir at the time. The song is so powerful and brings new spiritual thoughts about the love of Christ Jesus. Oh praise be to Jesus on such times in our lives with floods, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, crimes in our cities etc. Great song.</article>
	<article author="Brionna Brydie" email="" city="Salibury N,C" provst="East Spencer" country="" month="2" day="12" year="2009">I like this song because its a song about JESUS and it's a very slow, calm song and when I hear it I think about JESUS.</article>
