------------------------
There are 2 additional stanzas, usually omitted, which follow stanza 2 above:
Thou art a port, protected 
from storms that round us rise;
 A garden, intersected 
with streams of paradise;
 Thou art a cooling fountain 
in life’s dry, dreary sand;
 From thee, like Pisgah’s mountain, 
we view our promised land.
-------------------------
Thou art a holy ladder, 
where angels go and come;
 Each Sunday finds us gladder, 
nearer to heaven, our home;
 A day of sweet refection, 
thou art a day of love,
 A day of resurrection 
from earth to things above.</article>
    <article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="2" day="25" year="2013">"It is the first duty of a hymn," said Christopher Wordsworth, "to teach sound doctrine and thence to save souls." He opposed the trend of 19th century hymnists to write about personal experiences. As the nephew of the noted English poet William Wordsworth, he might have been expected to be a poet as well. But after distinguishing himself as a scholar and athlete at Cambridge, he went into the ministry, eventually becoming a Church of England bishop. He was a recognized Greek scholar and wrote a commentary on the entire Bible as well as a hymnal including 117 original hymns. The 2nd stanza of this hymn is a good example of the way Wordsworth used his hymns to teach doctrine. On the 1st day of the week God created light; on the 1st day of the week Christ arose; and on the 1st day of the week the Holy Spirit was given. Thus Sunday is a day honored 3 times. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown and Norton

The 1st verse and 1st half of the last verse are a bit different in the original:
1st verse:
O day of rest and gladness,
O day of joy and light,
O balm of care and sadness,
Most beautiful, most bright:
On thee the high and lowly,
Through ages joined in tune,
Sing holy, holy, holy,
To the great God Triune.

1st half of last verse:
New graces ever gaining
From this our day of rest,
We reach the rest remaining
To spirits of the blest.</article>
