Cushing was born in Hingham, Massachusetts. He was a successful pastor of Disciples of Christ churches for more than 20 years. After the death of his wife in 1870, he was forced to retire from ministering due to ill health. He then began to write hymns. He eventually wrote over 300 hymns. Concerning this hymn he says:
“‘Hiding in Thee’ was writ­ten in Mo­ra­via, New York, in 1876. It must be said of this hymn that it was the out­growth of ma­ny tears, ma­ny heart-con­flicts and soul-yearn­ings, of which the world can know no­thing. The his­to­ry of ma­ny bat­tles is be­hind it. But the oc­ca­sion which gave it be­ing was the call of Mr. Sank­ey. He said, ‘Send me something new to help me in my Gos­pel work.’ A call from such a source, and for such a pur­pose, seemed a call from God. I so re­gard­ed it, and prayed: ‘Lord, give me some­thing that may glor­i­fy Thee.’ It was while thus wait­ing that ‘Hid­ing in Thee’ pressed to make it­self known. Mr. Sank­ey called forth the tune, and by his gen­i­us gave the hymn wings, mak­ing it use­ful in the Mas­ter’s work. (Sankey's Story of the Gospel Hymns) - Songs of the Spirit by Martin</article>

Born and raised a preacher's kid, I grew up with this hymn and many others. As a child, living under the roof of the security of my parents' spiritual passion, I did not realize as a child how much I would need these songs as a refuge in my adult years. This is priceless!!! It's unfortunate that this current generation aren't being introduced to the old hymns as much. I pray that today's contemporary music will have enough spiritual substance to carry them through the tough times we all experience, learning all the while to trust and depend on God. He's an amazing Savior!! :)</article>

Always feeling blessed with this song. TO GOD BE THE GLORY!</article>

They are disturbing me, how to answer the assurance that God is able to cope while they are undergoing catastrophic eruption is very sad.
With this song I was given inspiration, passion and certainty. Thank God.</article>

	<article author="Mark Lee Inman" email="mark.inman@aims.co.uk" city="Brentwood" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="8" day="27" year="2013">This was my late father's favourite hymn. Sadly, it has fallen in popularity and is excluded from most post 1960 hymn book collections. A shame, because it is a great hymn of comfort and assurance.</article>
	<article author="Lynelle W" email="ldwatford@gmail.com" city="St Joseph" provst="Michigan" country="United States" month="11" day="27" year="2012">I was thinking of Psalm 61:2 (From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I.) for the past few days and last night thought of this song, but couldn't remember much of it. So happy to have found it here! The words and the scripture it is based on brings comfort to my heart. So grateful that God is a refuge that can never be shaken.</article>

It's a song that assures me of an ever present Saviour even in my lowest moments. I hold on to Him since it's Him and Him alone who can offer peace that passes human understanding. Thank You Jesus.</article>

While in Madras at home my dad would teach my mom songs from Golden Bells as he played the organ. We would gather half an hour before Friday prayer meetings. Mum had a beautiful voice. She would start on the right note. Glorious Days! Childhood memories. Both of them are with the Lord. Thanks to Google.</article>
