This hymn flows up my mind. He is my beloved Shepherd. When I am lost He comes to lead, when I am being defeated, He is there I am not afraid but proclaim my victory. But all is for His name. I thank the Lord, He is so loving, faithful in His shepherding work. Lord, make me the same as You that I can also be there with the weak ones. Lord, duplicate me to be Your faithful servant.</article>
