	<article author="John MacDonald" email="" city="Dunedin" provst="Otago" country="New Zealand" month="4" day="25" year="2012">What a wonderful hymn this is. May we all sing this hymn to the Lord. What a revival so many could have by making this their honest prayer and longing before God. 

Brother Lee wrote this hymn for the sake of those in the church who are weak, backsliden or cold, in order to help them. (See Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 4, p.157)

Lord Jesus, may we no londer remain in such a state. Make this prayer our prayer Lord Jesus, that we would follow You.</article>
	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="10" day="6" year="2009">Hymns, #471 uses an 8.8.6.8.8.6. metrical form; that is, the words in each stanza are in two lines of eight syllables and one line of six syllables, which are repeated twice. The sound is very regular and rhythmic. I mention this hymn because I want to stir up an atmosphere of seeking out our brothers and sisters. Stanza 1 says, "How can I ever stay away / And grieve Thy Spirit all the day / While Thou dost wait for me? / I now am willing to return, / And wait no longer, for I yearn / Henceforth to follow Thee."

The last line of the first stanza says, "Henceforth to follow Thee." As we sing, our spirit will be stirred up. As we sing another verse, our spirit will go forth. As we continue singing, we will desire to seek out people, just as the Lord Jesus did, who after being incarnated in the flesh, was willing to go to the cross because of His deep desire to gain man.
