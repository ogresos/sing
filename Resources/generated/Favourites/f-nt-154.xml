	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="25" year="2008">Some hymns may be in the same category and of the same subject but have a different feeling. Every hymn has its feeling. For example, "It passeth knowledge, that dear love of Thine" (Hymns, #154) is a hymn for remembering the Lord and has the Lord's love as its subject. The feeling of this hymn is fine, sweet, and tender. The feeling of other hymns may not be as fine as this one, even though their subject is the Lord's love. Some hymns have a fine feeling and are also poetic. Other hymns, however, may not be poetic. In learning the hymns, we need to know their categories and subject so that we can further distinguish them according to their feeling.
