	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="" month="4" day="18" year="2014">Mr. H. D'Arcy Champney, M.A. of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, was ordained as a Church of England clergyman. He was gifted in preaching, especially the gospel, but despite the fact that there was a large field of labour open to him in Cambridge, he resigned his clerical post to throw in his lot with the 'brethren'. Subsequently he started a school for the sons of brethren at 51 Bateman Street, Cambridge. Mr. Champney was only 36 in 1890 – and living in Cambridge – when he wrote his 'Letter to the Saints Gathered to the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ', in which he skillfully chronicles the malicious and vicious opposition to Mr. Raven and the truth and touchingly appeals to those in danger of being led astray by the partisan and divisive actions of some prominent persons. 

His initials often appear in readings with both F. E. Raven and J. Taylor. - mybrethren

The chorus and stanzas 2 &amp; 3 above were not in the original. Stanza 4 above is the original 2nd stanza. There are 2 more stanzas:
------------------
3 "Lord, what is man?" we would break forth exclaiming;
Jesus, the crowned One, the Lamb that was slain!
Joyful we own Thee, Thy praises proclaiming;
Death Thou hast vanquished by rising again!
----------------------------------
4 "Lord, what is man?" Yes, with deep adoration,
Gladly prolong we this wonderful theme;
Jesus, divine One, Thou Head of creation,
Head of Thy church, which Thou cam'st to redeem!</article>
