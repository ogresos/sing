Praise God. Christ is in the midst of His church; each church an angel - what does your angel report to the Lord you did last Sunday? Bicker? Gossip? Want the Pastor out? Can't forgive that sister? What does your angel see you do? Are you dead, thinking you are alive? Is it all work and no substance? Are you wedded to the world, because "that's how it is TODAY"? 
OR will you stand firm and stand up for Jesus?</article>
