I have heard it so many times and every time it touches me the same like the first time... this certain man robbed, beaten, lefted almost to death is me... and is you. And this precious Samaritan, the very Triune God came to become a human babe... to the good Savior just to save us from such condition... I did nothing! I deserve nothing! I deserved to go to hell for eternity but this wonderful person took this way, enter to humanity to reach me.. what a story! what big love, no word in this world would describe such mercy and unfailing love. And yet.. brought me to the inn... the church life, to be healed, nourished, feeded, ... oh God. Thank you. Forever thank you! I just want to be in the church life and never let go!</article>

We are allmuch less love by others
With GOD'S merciful and loving heart
He seeks us and saves us
With His divine life.
He as the Man-Savior
With His humanity 
And His divinity
He cares for you and me.
