The "lily" is mentioned twice, and is located in two places or two situations. She is "in the valleys" or "among the thorns". Valleys are plural as well as thorns! The trusting, loving lily is either in the valleys of low, obscure, hidden places constantly looking to Him; or among the thorns piercing her, yet driving her into more intimate union and fellowship with the Beloved, Christ!</article>
