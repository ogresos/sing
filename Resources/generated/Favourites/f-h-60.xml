In 379 he was invited to Rome to become part of the emperor's staff. He was fascinated by Rome with its new Christian churches and the tombs of the martyrs. Christianity had been legalized earlier that century and was now the official religion of the empire. 
Despite his early enthusiasm, Prudentius soon grew weary of public life. He felt he had become too self-centered, so, in 395 he forsook his worldly position and entered a monastery. There he wrote several devotional and practical works. A few fragments like this have been translated and set to music. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>

Between stanzas 1 &amp; 2:
-------------------
At His Word the worlds were framèd; 
He commanded; it was done:
 Heaven and earth and depths of ocean 
in their threefold order one;
 All that grows beneath the shining
 Of the moon and burning sun, 
evermore and evermore!
-------------------------
Before the last stanza:
------------------------
Righteous judge of souls departed, 
righteous King of them that live,
 On the Father’s throne exalted 
none in might with Thee may strive;
 Who at last in vengeance coming
 Sinners from Thy face shalt drive, 
evermore and evermore!
---------------------------------
Thee let old men, thee let young men, 
thee let boys in chorus sing;
 Matrons, virgins, little maidens, 
with glad voices answering:
 Let their guileless songs re-echo,
 And the heart its music bring, 
evermore and evermore!
-----------------------------------
He is found in human fashion, 
death and sorrow here to know,
 That the race of Adam’s children 
doomed by law to endless woe,
 May not henceforth die and perish
 In the dreadful gulf below, 
evermore and evermore!
-----------------------------
O that birth forever blessèd,
 when the virgin, full of grace,
 By the Holy Ghost conceiving, 
bare the Savior of our race;
 And the Babe, the world’s Redeemer,
 First revealed His sacred face, 
evermore and evermore!</article>
