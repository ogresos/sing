	<article author="Ken Oswald" email="" city="Seattle" provst="Wa" country="USA" month="3" day="7" year="2008">Our creator is so deeply relational with His creation, that He gave Himself the name, Father. Abba Father...best translation is,"Daddy".  We all have earthly fathers.  Some of us are lucky enough to have had a daddy, who sweetly loved us and, through their faithfulness toward us, launched us into the world.  Our heavenly Father,  with the Holy Spirit, birthed us into His eternal family, as His beloved children.  Our fathers here may, or may not have loved us, but our Heavenly Father loves us now and into the eternal dwellings He and Christ is preparing for us.  How great is our salvation.</article>

After calling on the Lord one day, I was led to cry from deep within, "Abba Father". The Lord still has so much to accomplish so He can return. In my prayer to the Lord, in showing the Lord what has not been done, He was so sweet to lead me to cry to Him in this way! Abba Father! Abba, we Love You! Abba we need You! Get what you are after in me.</article>
