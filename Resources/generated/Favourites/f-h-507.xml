	<article author="Tom" email="" city="Milwaukee" provst="" country="United States" month="7" day="13" year="2014">As rays of light from yonder sun,
 The flowâ€™rs of earth set free,
So life and light and love come forth
 From Christ living in me.
What a lovely image! Christ within frees me. He frees me to truly live, to be filled with light and to love those around us to the uttermost. Does this verse include a single thing for me to DO? No, not one. We are the vessels made of clay, and we just enjoy this indescribable gift, Christ living in us. Oh receive it, my soul! Oh take this gift as your own, dear reader and hymn enjoyer! God has removed every requirement and every obstacle by fulfilling them in us and for us. My soul, stop your struggles to do what has already been fulfilled in you! Foolish and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken! Is this gift too great for you to believe it could be given? Is it too good to be true? Yes, too good to be true, but "no eye has seen, no ear has heard, nor has the mind of man imagined the things that God has prepared for those who love Him."</article>

	<article author="tim" email="" city="Dunedin" provst="" country="New Zealand" month="4" day="7" year="2008">Two functions of the truth are to free us and to sanctify us (John 8:32; 17:17). Since Adam's fall, men are further and further away from God, but through Christ's accomplishment, we become near to God, Christ in us is continually freeing us daily. I enjoy the line "but in God's Word the light I found', this is the truth freeing us from everything Christ crucified with Him on the cross.</article>

	<article author="Hymnal.net" city="" provst="" country="" month="12" day="5" year="2013">In the church meetings, we may enjoy singing, "Christ liveth in me, Christ liveth in me." However, when the meeting is over, we are the ones who live, not Christ. Instead of Christ living in us, our inward being is occupied with ourselves. But if we see the vision of Christ living in us, we shall stop all our doing. How blessed it is to do nothing and to let Christ live in us! The Lord does not want us to try to improve our behavior. He does not want us to try to be a good husband or wife. The Christian life is Christ living in us. In such a life, we and Christ have one life and one living. Christ lives in our living. Oh, we desperately need to see this vision! We need to pray, "Lord, show me the vision that God only wants one Person. He wants Christ to live in me." This vision will spontaneously terminate all of our efforts and doings. It will turn us from our trying to the indwelling Christ.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="4" day="1" year="2008">I appreciate the fact that Christ lives in us. There is even a hymn in our hymnal with this chorus:

Christ liveth in me,
Christ liveth in me;
Oh! what a salvation this,
That Christ liveth in me.

However, simply to say that Christ lives in us is to be too objective. We also need to experience living in Christ and doing all things in Him. What a salvation it is to live in Him! If we live in Him, we shall enjoy His salvation day by day. This salvation can be compared to riding in a car. As long as we remain in the car, we enjoy salvation. When I ride in a car, I am not worried about what direction I am going or anything else. I may rest, pray, or enjoy sight-seeing. I simply rest and enjoy myself. In like manner, when we are in Christ, we should simply rest and enjoy ourselves. We should enjoy the life in Christ.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="31" year="2008">The burden of this ministry is to produce Christ in the believers. This means that the goal of this ministry is not to teach you to be humble or merely to glorify God in your behavior. Rather, the goal of this ministry is to "inject" you with Christ, to impart Christ as an "antibiotic" to you. The more we receive such an injection, the more we will be able to sing, "Christ liveth in me,/Christ liveth in me;/Oh! what a salvation this,/That Christ liveth in me" (Hymns, #507). On the one hand, this injection of Christ will kill our old man; on the other hand, it will make us producers of Christ, those who minister Christ to others.
