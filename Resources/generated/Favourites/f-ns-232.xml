All things in the world are vanity. The Lord wants to have a bride for His counterpart. May we be those that gain Him everyday and every moment. Amen.</article>
	<article author="Betty" email="bettynoonan@gmail.com" city="Wickenburg" provst="AZ" country="" month="6" day="15" year="2014">How true that 'everything under the sun is vanity like chasing after wind so emptily! But praise God, He has put within us eternity. God created us for His eternal purpose, not for the vanity of the world! Lord, I want to live in You, for Your heart's desire, 'til Your city we become eternally.</article>

	<article author="Anonymous" email="" city="" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="3" day="8" year="2011">God's desire is not that we suffer but that we rejoice in what He has done. The 2 greatest commendments are "love God and love your neighbour". Jesus came for the lost and the sick, and through us, His body, He continues to love the lost. If we reject the lost people in the world the life of Christ cannot be in us.</article>

He had the realization that God is the reality, and that man can only be satisfied with the eternal things. We all should have this realization!</article>
	<article author="Gloria Ting" email="" city="HAMILTON" provst="" country="New Zealand" month="6" day="20" year="2009">I enjoy this hymn, esp where it says "Everything under the sun is vanity:
its like chasing after the wind, so emptily *so true*
You have put me Lord so eternity" :)</article>
	<article author="Joey" email="" city="London" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="1" day="21" year="2009">Working in a hospital especially for elderly patients, I can't help but to wonder: is this all our life about?

Daily, as I look at the patients' wrinkled faces, I thought to myself: these are the faces who once were as wrinkle-free as mine; but what have they achieved?

We are all ageing. At the end of days, what matters is how much we know the Lord. We all need to be confronted with this question: How much have I enjoyed the Lord? And how much am I constituted with Christ? And how much have I loved the church and cared for the Body?

Apart from Christ, everthing is vanity of vanities. No wonder the most glamarous man in the world cried, "Everything under the sun is vanity." What is the point of gaining the whole world but losing Christ? 

We don't have much time left. Every second of worldly enjoyment amounts to every second of losing Christ. May we all be wise virgins: to pay the price that we may have oil in our lamp when the Lord comes back.

Much grace, a brother in Christ</article>
