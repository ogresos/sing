To Christ, the Lord, let every tongue
 Its noblest tribute bring
 When He’s the subject of the song,
 Who can refuse to sing?
----------------------------------------------
Survey the beauties of His face,
 And on His glories dwell;
 Think of the wonders of His grace,
 And all His triumphs tell,
-----------------
The following 2 stanzas follow the hymnal.net stanza #2
He saw me plunged in deep distress
 And flew to my relief;
 For me He bore the shameful cross
 And carried all my grief,
 ------------
His hand a thousand blessings pours
 Upon my guilty head:
 His presence gilds my darkest hours,
 And guards my sleeping bed,
---------------
Line #1 of hymnal.net stanza #4 originally says:
To Heav’n, the place of His abode,</article>
