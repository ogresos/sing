To me it is so amazing that there is such a High Priest in heaven caring for us; we are always on His heart, and He cares for us so much all the time. Why should we be fearful or anxious when we have such a lovely person supplying us?</article>

    <article author="Helen" email="" city="" provst="" country="Canada" month="10" day="2" year="2004">The Lord has touched me this morning with this hymn.  My most vulnerable aspect in the "self" is my anxiety and pride.  This past week was full of worries and procastinating that I was apart from the Lord and became a prey to the evil one.  Coming across this hymn, He reminds me to just abide and rest in Him.  I praise the Lord for exposing my weakness because of my lack of Him.  Praise the Lord that "In the Church of Jesus, there's always a place us!".</article>
