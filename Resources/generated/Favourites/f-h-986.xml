    <article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="12" day="23" year="2008">The chorus of Hymns, #986 says, "What a wonderful Savior is Jesus, my Savior; / What a wonderful Savior is Jesus, my Lord!" The word wonderful can also be replaced with trustworthy, lovely, or precious. There is no other Savior like Him under heaven or among men. He is both God and man; He is both the greatest and the least. He died for us, bearing all our sins and solving all our problems.

Many people who receive Jesus change immediately because Jesus has entered into their life. The Lord Jesus is not an objective Savior to them; instead, He enters into them as their subjective Savior. He is their life, light, heat, and power; He evens communicates with them. As a result, people who believe in Jesus are enlivened. The Lord Jesus, as both God and man, is our Savior. He is the greatest and the least; therefore, He is able to care for us in the most detailed way, and He is also omnipotent. He not only died for us but also enters into us to live for us. This is the wonderful Savior who is spoken of in Hymns, #986. He is trustworthy and lovely; He is so precious. May we all receive this wonderful Savior.
