	<article author="Alademomi Alfred" email="geomfred@yahoo.com" city="Lagos" provst="" country="Nigeria" month="11" day="25" year="2015">Indeed, this is a devotional song, full of inspiration and life. It's a song that every heaven desired Christian must keep like a mirror before their lives every moment to enable them check thoroughly their daily walk and relationship with God. Since I listened to this song, it has opened my eyes and humbled my heart. It has been to me like Jacob's ladder that reach from earth to the glorious heavenly home. May the Lord give all the listener of this song the enabling grace to apply all its wordings upon our lives daily so that nothing of the world and its pleasures will stand between us and God all the remain time of our sojourn here in this sinful world. Blessed be the Lord for the inspiration given to the composer of this song. We as the remaining soldier of the cross, wave the banner back to heaven that we will by the grace of God triumph over the world and its allurement and be in heaven to enjoy eternal fellowship with the Lord who died for us.</article>
	<article author="Mike Moore" email="revmikemoore@me.com" city="Morris Chapel" provst="TN" country="United States" month="10" day="20" year="2015">I first listened to this hymn 45 years ago. My father, who was a pastor had accepted a call from a very rural Baptist church on the eastern boarder of West Temnessee. I was 14 years of age and had drifted far from my previously blouse walk with God. We moved from the flourishing and affluent area of Biloxi, MS to this backwoods area. The church was the same denomination as that which I had been a member since I was saved but oh so much different. I could always memorize hymns very quickly and they had always been a vital portion of my worship to God. One of the first things I noticed was that this church sang different hymns. It took me a month or so to memorize all of those new hymns, but today I am so thankful the Lord led me to do that because today, they continue to live on in my heart and mind as rare treasures, and this one is among the most rare in value! The Lord leads me to it often for I need to be reminded of its challenge, "Keep the way clear let nothing between!</article>

	<article author="Akanyi" email="simeon345@yahoo.com" city="Benin" provst="Edo" country="Nigeria" month="3" day="4" year="2015">This song remained in my heart since I hared it sang in a meeting, it shows the victory of the saints and it keep challenging me every day to keep nothing between me and the Savior as I follow, I pray to You Father that keep men on the narrow way with nothing between till they reached the glorious end to send me help from above so I will end with nothing between me and You in Your glory in Jesus name.</article>

	<article author="Anne Ogutu" email="anne.ogutu@gmail.com" city="Irving" provst="Texas" country="" month="4" day="7" year="2014">Nothing between my soul and the SAVIOR!! Not even the greatest dream of this world should ever come between me and the SAVIOR Who did not allow anything to come between HIM and my salvation, not even HIS angels could come between HIM and my salvation. When I think of my SAVIOR I wonder what kind of love HE has for me a sinner? No human words can explain or express it "Behold, what manner of love the FATHER hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of GOD: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew HIM not." 1 John 3:1. I knew this hymn while attending Elizabeth English SDA church in NJ between 2004-2009. It made such an impact in my life and so... I pray "LORD help me never to allow anything to come between me and YOU my LORD and my SAVIOR'. Pastor Jeddy Hooker loved it so much. It is my sincere prayer that our children and grand children before CHRIST comes back again to take HIS saints to heaven they may be given a chance to know this hymn and many other hymns that are hardly heard in our churches today. LORD have mercy on our generation. Thank you for putting it online. Be blessed.</article>

	<article author="Samson Akinwale" email="samson.akinwale@gmail.com" city="Lagos" provst="" country="Nigeria" month="4" day="17" year="2013">I first listened to this all-time soul refreshing song about nine years ago. I've never recovered from its influence ever since. Same song flooded my soul for the past three days now and I purposed to google to sing all the lyrics over again on-line. Jesus be blessed because He's the essence of the untold sweetness behind both the lyrics and music. All glory to God. Appreciation to the composer.</article>
	<article author="Jana" email="" city="Potchefstroom" provst="" country="South Africa" month="11" day="16" year="2012">What really stands out for me in this song, is that no "habits of life, though harmless they seem" should prevent me from receiving the blessings the LORD wants to pour out over me. And also the last verse - will I be willing to stand "though the whole world against me convene"? The only way I'll stand and triumph is by "watching with prayer and much self-denial" - what a blessed song this is! Glory to Jesus!</article>
	<article author="Janice Trostle" email="" city="New Providence" provst="Pennsylvania" country="United States" month="8" day="16" year="2012">Years ago when my father pastored a church, he would often lead the prayer meeting with this song.

	<article author="Saint Levinus Nwabughiogu" email="" city="Abuja" provst="FCT" country="Nigeria" month="5" day="10" year="2012">I have sung songs. I have listened to many renditions. I have also taken part in many congregational hymns both in and outside the church but on this day when this hymn was rendered in the church, I was moved. Even close to tears. Then I said a silent prayer for God's Grace upon my life. He is the only One I have got. There is nothing between, by His Grace.</article>
	<article author="Pastor Kolapo Oluseye" email="" city="Abuja" provst="FCT" country="Nigeria" month="12" day="12" year="2011">This song is so so refreshing.
I remember my days at the University in Ibadan Nigeria, we will sing this song in the Choir again and again.
It is one of my favorite hymns. It keeps the Love for God burning with a new intensity on the altar of our hearts, little wonder we were able to impart the University Community so much with the Glorious Gospel that was committed to our trust.</article>

	<article author="Louise Lockett" email="" city="Warminster" provst="PA" country="U.S.A." month="4" day="14" year="2004">I like this song because the author expressed his complete faith and loyalty in the Lord Jesus. He was born a black slave, but was self-educated as a child and was determined to serve the God whom had been with him throughout the early difficult years of his life. The music is beautiful.</article>
