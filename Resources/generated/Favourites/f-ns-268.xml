	<article author="Anil" email="akgjunk@gmail.com" city="Toronto" provst="Ontario" country="Canada" month="3" day="22" year="2013">This is different from the version I grew up on:

Search me, O God,
And know my heart today;
Try me, O Savior,
Know my thoughts, I pray.

See if there be
Some wicked way in me;
Cleanse me from every sin
And set me free.

I praise Thee, Lord,
For cleansing me from sin;
Fulfill Thy Word,
And make me pure within.

Fill me with fire
Where once I burned with shame;
Grant my desire
To magnify Thy Name.

Lord, take my life,
And make it wholly Thine;
Fill my poor heart
With Thy great love divine.

Take all my will,
My passion, self and pride;
I now surrender, Lord
In me abide.

O Holy Ghost,
Revival comes from Thee;
Send a revival,
Start the work in me.

Thy Word declares
Thou wilt supply our need;
For blessings now,
O Lord, I humbly plead.</article>

	<article author="Barry" email="" city="Halifax" provst="Nova Scotia" country="Canada" month="5" day="7" year="2012">The current tune playing on this site is not the one I am familiar with. 

I am referring to the original tune which was first heard in New Zealand as the "Maori Farewell Song" in 1911, and has since been done by many well known secular artists such as Bing Crosby and Vera Lynn, and many others.</article>

	<article author="Jenny" email="" city="Caldwell" provst="ID" country="United States" month="4" day="26" year="2011">I have sung this only at ladies' Bible Studies and family camp for one particular church we attended and loved it from the start!
I have been looking for it for a long time! If anyone has a vocal version that I could put on iTunes, please tell me where to find it!! Please, please!
As far as singing it on my own in my own devotions, I am not quite sure how it starts, so I need a vocal version to sing along with.</article>
