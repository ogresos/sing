    <article author="Ifeanyi Ukwuoma" city="Delft" provst="" country="Netherlands" month="4" day="6" year="2012">I heard this hymn for the first time in Lagos, Nigeria...It was a Lord's table meeting and the spirits of the saints were so refreshed and living...We sang this hymn over and over again. My greatest impression concerning this hymn is that it is a prayer...a deep prayer to the Lord to carry out His work of transformation...It tells us God's Intention and also how to enter and participate in God's Intention..Saturate us with Thy Spirit...Hallelujah</article>
    <article author="L. C." city="San Juan" provst="M.M." country="Philippines" month="11" day="18" year="2009">Transformation takes place through the renewing of the mind, emotion and will (Rom. 12:2). These basic inner parts of our being need transformation. This transformation will make us stones for God's building. ~ LS of Genesis 87</article>
    <article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="31" year="2008">The Lord also promised the faithful ones at Pergamos that He would give them a white stone on which a new name is written (Rev. 2:17). If we do not follow the worldly church but enjoy the Lord in the proper church life, we will be transformed into stones for the building of God. There are millions of Christians today, but it is difficult to see any one of them built up together with others. We are not built up with others because we all have our peculiar traits. This is why there are many separations and divorces among husbands and wives. The husband and wife cannot be built up together because of their peculiar traits.

In like manner, we cannot be built up together in the church life because of our peculiarities. We all have our particular, peculiar traits. This is why we need to be transformed. It would be helpful for us to sing the following hymn (Hymns, #750) on transformation with our heart and with our spirit.
...
We need such transformation. Then we will no longer be natural, and we will be able to be built up together. God desires a house, not individual pieces of material. God wants all the individual material to be built together to be His house, to be His Body. Therefore, today our urgent need is to be transformed.

    <article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="31" year="2008">Before we were saved, we were merely physical beings in a physical world, but one day Jesus visited us privately in a spiritual way. We received Him and He regenerated us privately, secretly, and spiritually with God's divine life. From that day we became spiritual, but just partially, in our spirit. The rest of our entire being still remained untransformed in the physical world. Stanza 2 of Hymns, #750 says: 'God hath us regenerated / In our spirit with His life; / But He must transform us further—/ In our soul by His own life.' After regeneration God works to transform our untransformed part, our soul.

    <article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="24" year="2008">Romans 12:2 says that we are to be transformed by the renewing of our mind. The mind is the main part of our soul. The second part is the emotion, and the third is the will. To transform us is to metabolically change our soul. Verse 2 and the chorus of hymn #750 (Hymns) say:

God hath us regenerated
In our spirit with His life;
But He must transform us further—
In our soul by His own life.

Lord, transform us to Thine image
In emotion, mind, and will;
Saturate us with Thy Spirit,
All our being wholly fill.

First, God regenerated us and now He is transforming us by the renewing of our mind, emotion, and will.
