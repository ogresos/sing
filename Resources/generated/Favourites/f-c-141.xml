	<article author="Anne" email="jimnannehealy@bigpond.com" city="Newcastle" provst="NSW" country="Australia" month="2" day="7" year="2014">I first heard this song as a teenager in New Zealand when some brothers were teaching us the guitar. I have since then always come back and gained encouragement from the words which reminds me that our function is just to shine! - To be a vessel to contain God's life - a mirror beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord. May we be so simple not to care for 'knowing' or 'striving' so much - to simply feed on Him and He will take care of us.

I have been searching for all the verses and am so happy to have found them.</article>

	<article author="Joan Bodeman" email="joanbodeman@gmail.com" city="Aptos" provst="CA" country="United States" month="7" day="8" year="2013">I have always appreciated this small song, especially while I was uncomfortably pregnant with my daughter. All I could do was trust the Lord, and sing Him this song in simplicity was a big help. I had forgotten all the stanzas, so I'm thankful to the Lord that Jamal shared them. 

I appreciate that the Lord has called the saints to create this website reference and use it often. Thank you.</article>
	<article author="Ira Hsu" email="" city="Eugene" provst="OR" country="United States" month="10" day="12" year="2011">This song is a good reminder of our position before the Lord... to be a simple, open vessel, turned toward Him every day! Lord Jesus, make us poor in spirit and willing to receive whatever You have in store for us today.</article>

	<article author="Jamal" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="5" day="21" year="2010">1. I'm just a little flower with open face; 
I'm fully turned to God, receiving grace.
I don’t know how to try. This is my case
I’m just a lily trusting God

2. There’s nothing on this earth that I desire. 
There’s no experience that I require.
I only want one thing that I aspire
To be a lily trusting God.

3. If when I trust in God I’m put to shame; 
If when I walk with God I come out lame;
These things don’t bother me; I’m not to blame
Since I’m a lily trusting God.

4. With all your worrying to clothe yourself; 
So many lies you’ve told to gather wealth;
And though you’ve gotten rich, you’ve lost your health
Just be a lily trusting God.

5. It seems you know so much, But yet you fall;
And though you talk so much, yet you won’t call;
So what’s the use of it, for after all
Just be a lily trusting God.

6. So please don’t bother me with all your fears; 
You strive and try so hard with sweat and tears.
Have faith in Jesus Christ. He’s always near! 
Just be a lily trusting God.

7. Yes, please don’t bother me, I’m growing fine. 
Oh please don’t share with me what’s on your mind.
I may not know so much, but still I shine. 
For I’m a lily trusting God.

8. And please don’t bother me with all your cares; 
Don’t make me listen to your begging prayers;
Our God is very great—He really cares! 
Just be a lily trusting God.

9. It seems that I don’t care so much for you; 
But if you knew my heart, I really do;
Yet lilies don’t know how to fret and stew
I’m just a lily, How ’bout you?</article>

	<article author="Sarah" email="" city="sydney" provst="" country="Australia" month="4" day="7" year="2008">When i came across this song, I got so excited because when I was a little girl this song was my favourite, so much so I made my mum sing it to me all the time. As a child I was a bit sensitive and found solace in the fact that no matter what I can trust God in all things. Actually no matter how old you get you can never graduate from trusting God. Actually at the moment I'm at a cross roads in my life and it is still nice to know that whatever I do, just trust in God. Just be a lilly trusting in God.</article>
	<article author="Fred R Balsabas" email="" city="San Antonio Heights" provst="Sto. Tomas" country="Batangas" month="9" day="19" year="2007">I am a young person with a lot of hope, dream, and ambition. One day the Lord came and dealt with my situation. Everything changes abruptly, until I confess that all my hope, dreams, and ambition are just a piece of vanity. Only on Him we should settle our hope, dream, and ambition. Only in Christ we found a perfect peace and rest.</article>
