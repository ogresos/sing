I treasure these words because they remind me there is no despair with the risen Jesus. He can and does wipe away the darkness within me.</article>

	<article author="Regan Ryan" email="" city="Dunedin" provst="" country="New Zealand" month="3" day="12" year="2013">God was moved with love to send His Son to die for us, and Ephesians mentions that we are saved by grace, but the foundation of our salvation is righteousness. Because of God's righteousness, even if He stopped loving us, or decided to withhold His grace, He is bound by His righteousness to forgive us.

We sinned, and because of God's righteousness, God could not forgive us.
He died, and because of God's righteousness, God *must* forgive us. 

The gospel is the power of God unto salvation, because the righteousness of God is revealed in it.</article>

I prefer that tune for this hymn. It is a very famous tune, I recommend you search for it on Google. It is not available on hymnal.net as far as I know.</article>
