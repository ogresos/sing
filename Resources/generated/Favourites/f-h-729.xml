We need the sun as well as the rain in order to grow in life in a healthy way, so the Lord in His care and mercy sends us both at the proper time. Too much sun is sure to wither us, so we also need the rain. Praise the Lord that the clouds are there to do a work of transformation in us! May we not shy away from them, for they are a true blessing.</article>
