There were several thousand saints gathered on the UGA campus. As the Bread and Wine were passed around and we sang this hymn, I saw the Body of Christ as a reality. This is one of if not the greatest hymn on the church every written.</article>

	<article author="Helen" email="" city="Mississauga" provst="ON" country="Canada" month="12" day="16" year="2003">This hymn describes what the "church" is, not a physical location where the saints meet, but "Christ's own Body" which are the saints. In verse one, it says, "The gathering of the called ones, God blended with man's race". What a revelation that we are one with God, in one spirit with the saints.

Praise the Lord! That also through the process He has undergone, we have inherited the Spirit of God, the life of God and the position of God, as His sons. Thank you, Lord!</article>
	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="27" year="2008">In the table of contents of our hymnal there is a category called "The Church." It covers the church as the mystery of Christ, the increase of Christ, the fullness of Christ, the vessel of Christ, and the lampstand of Christ. It also covers the church's general definition, course, faith, unity, foundation, building, attraction, coordination, and fellowship. Hymns, #824 is on the general definition of the church, whereas #852 is on the attraction of the church. Perhaps many of us have been in the church life for a number of years, yet we are still not clear about the definition of the church, nor do we know what kind of price we need to pay when we are attracted by the church. These two hymns reveal to us these two aspects of the truth. I hope that we all can earnestly study the truths contained in our hymns.
