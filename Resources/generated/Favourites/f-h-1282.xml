The need to march on. We must be those who are like the advancing God always marching on. We should not be ensnared by what we have acquired in the past that was good, nor our doctrine or experiences. We must enjoy the seven Spirits of God and be strengthened to come out of the past.
We should be in the present truth, the present revelation through the fresh speakings shining with more light.
This marching on.</article>
