"Looking away unto Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross despising the shame, and has sat down on the right hand of the throne of God.
"The wonderful Jesus who is enthroned in heaven and crowned with glory and honor, is the greatest attraction in the universe. He is like an immense magnet, drawing all His seekers to Him. It is by being attracted by His charming beauty that we look away from all things other than Him. Without such a charming object, how could we look away from so many distracting things on this earth?" Footnote in Recovery Version, p. 779</article>
