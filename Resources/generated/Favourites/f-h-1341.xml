	<article author="Shell Hickin" email="" city="Ballarat" provst="Victoria" country="Australia" month="4" day="13" year="2016">Wow, this song came to me today, not surprisingly actually, as I've been having some down moments &amp; this has lifted me! You may wonder where I remember it from, well it was back in the early 80's, at church, where it was a very lively &amp; catchy song. I think I will pass it on to a few others, &amp; see if my folks remember it! The good thing I remember about church songs back in the 80's is, they seem to be directly from the Bible verses, which I feel is amazing! Some songs these days aren't really what you would imagine biblical songs to be like. I know God knows our hearts. God bless to all. &lt;&gt;&lt;</article>
	<article author="Laurice Cox" email="pilgrimlc@sbcglobal.net" city="Milam County" provst="Texas" country="United States" month="3" day="28" year="2016">I was led by the Lord this morning to Isaiah 35. When I read verse 10 I was struck by a portion of this melody--a song I sang many, many years ago, and not sure even where. I tried many variations of titles on YouTube but couldn't find it, and I checked hymnals and a few web sites. So glad to have found it here! It is such a joyful, God-honoring song, and will be on my lips and in my heart for days, I am sure. By the way, it's precious to read other people's comments, too. May God richly bless each of you brothers and sisters! I will see you one day in Glory!</article>

This song popped into my brain. I wondered why? Before any exams they need to find out about you. I told them I had brain surgery 12 yrs ago. They needed to see the xrays. Well I wasn't getting the MRI because I have a metal clip in my brain. God saves lives. And He saved me again. He's so great.</article>

The struggling we are going through now surely can't be compared to the glorious happiness awaiting us believers Praise be to His name. Amen.</article>

	<article author="Bruce" email="bkberryhill@msn.com" city="San Diego" provst="CA" country="United States" month="8" day="7" year="2014">I have recently returned to the Lord and began reading my Bible again. I came across the verse in Isaiah 35:10, it reminded me of this song but I couldn't remember the whole song. Thank God for technology! I googled what I knew and it directed me here. So for the time being, this song will be my anthem!</article>
