	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="7" day="16" year="2014">I think an improvement to stanza 4 would be to change "cheerful He" to "for the joy", which is true according to Hebrews 12:2 and keeps the intention of the hymn's author.</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="7" day="15" year="2014">Samuel Crossman was associated with the Bristol Cathedral in England and became its dean shortly before his death. He published a small book called "The Young Man's Meditation." This hymn was lost for nearly 200 years until it was revived in 1868 in the "Anglican Hymn Book." - Songs of the Spirit by Martin
----------------
In stanza 4, the word "cheerful" is not accurate to describe the Lord's emotions while being led to the cross. Some hymnals have changed it to "steadfast" (I think correctly).
-------------------
There is an additional stanza following stanza 3 above:
Why, what hath my Lord done?
 What makes this rage and spite?
 He made the lame to run,
 he gave the blind their sight.
 Sweet injuries!
 Yet they at these
 themselves displease,
 and 'gainst him rise.</article>

	<article author="Glenn" email="" city="Fullerton" provst="CA" country="United States" month="4" day="14" year="2012">This is another gem hymn on the Lord's dynamic complete suffering as a God-man, with the Father's compassion and forgiveness of the sins of all mankind. What a hymn of the divine and mystical truth signified by His all-inclusive and all-encompassing death on the cross. Amen!! Thank You Lord Jesus for Your marvelous accomplishment. You alone art worthy to be praised!</article>
	<article author="William Brown" email="" city="Corpus Christi" provst="Texas" country="United States" month="12" day="18" year="2011">It melts my heart to love the Lord despite my unworthiness. Such a lovely song of Love Unknown.</article>
	<article author="Tom" email="" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="12" day="7" year="2010">Sing verse 4 with "I" instead of "they". Before salvation, we were all prodigal sons, asking for our inheritance, considering our father/master as dead, and we were also dead to him. Yet He died to make us alive to Him. Very moving.</article>
