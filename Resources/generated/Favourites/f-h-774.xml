	<article author="BJ Williams" email="brinsongirl5@comcast.net" city="Lake City" provst="FL" country="United States" month="5" day="5" year="2016">I woke up this morning with my situations and circumstances on my mind, and while trying to trust THE GOOD MASTER THE HOLY SPIRIT brought this hymn to mind, which I had the privilege of being exposed to years ago. I could not recall all the words, so I got up and pulled this title up on line. PERFECT! I love the assurance and peace the words give. Very endearing! Thank GOD for the writers of old who penned it and the musicians who put music to it. Love it!</article>

	<article author="Jean" email="tsen.jean@gmail.com" city="St Paul" provst="MN" country="United States" month="11" day="5" year="2015">For a lovely new choral arrangement of this hymn, I recommend the Josh Bauder's arrangement from his album, "Grace Alone". It captures the heavenly picture so well. You can find it on Youtube under the title, "The Mercy Seat" (I am not allowed to paste the link here).</article>
	<article author="李 菲 麗" email="" city="" provst="NC" country="United States" month="10" day="22" year="2011">Praise the Lord for the "mercy seat". The mercy seat in the Old Testament signifies the place that God dispenses His grace. In the New Testament, all of God's grace is dispensed to us through Christ. Exodus 25:22 says, "And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel." Thank the Lord that there is the blood of the cross upon God's mercy seat today. Through the blood, we can look up to God's glory and live in His glory. Thank the Lord that His propitiation has put us in a position where we can behold God's glory with unveiled face. This is the meaning of fellowship. Fellowship is not spending half an hour to an hour studying the Bible or praying. Fellowship is beholding God's glory through the blood and having a life that is totally for His glory. (from: Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 37: General Messages (1), Chapter 16, Section 1)</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="7" day="18" year="2009">it is sweet and comforting.

In the original, the 3rd line of v2 says, "A place of all on earth most sweet," 

There is an extra verse before the last one:
Ah! Whither could we flee for aid
When tempted, desolate, dismayed?
Or how the hosts of hell defeat,
Had suff’ring saints no mercy seat?

The 2nd line of the last verse in the original says:
"And sin and guilt seem there no more,"</article>
	<article author="Brian Towey" email="" city="Durham" provst="NC" country="United States" month="11" day="13" year="2008">In the old "Southern Harmony" this text goes with a much bolder tune ("Mercy Seat"), plus several additional verses. This is good; that is even better. If You like this, you'll love that!</article>
	<article author="Jerrylou" email="" city="Yakima" provst="Wa" country="United States" month="10" day="18" year="2008">I love this hymn. I love all the hymns, especially the more experiential ones of loving the Lord, Comfort in Trials...who doesn't have daily trials!!!, and Spiritual Warfare and Prayer.  Did I already say, "I love the hymns, and I thank the Lord and His faithful servants for making this site more user friendly as time goes on. Thank you for your labor of love. Many times the hymns can touch my heart when nothing else or no one else can. I love the Word, but I can memorize the hymns more easily. Thank you again.</article>
