A few of her earliest pieces were contributed to the Sunday Magazine, 1876, and later. Her Manual for Holy Communion is entitled "Corpus Christi", 1884. Her hymn, "Drawn to the Cross which Thou hast blessed" (Consecration of Self to Christ) was written in 1880, and printed the same year in the Sunday Magazine. It was afterwards included in her "Corpus Christi", 1884. Alluding to this hymn (which was included in the Primitive Methodist Hymnal, 1881) Miss Irons has written "I always feel that hymn is part of me ... It contains expressions and allusions which to my mind are only capable of a Catholic meaning: but I am interested and gratified in knowing that the hymn speaks to the hearts of many who would probably differ from me on most points of doctrine." - Dictionary of Hymnology by Julian
---------------
This hymn is usually sung to the tune of "Just as I am".
-------------
The original last stanza is:
And then for work to do for Thee,
 Which shall so sweet a service be
 That angels well might envy me,
 Christ crucified, I come.</article>
