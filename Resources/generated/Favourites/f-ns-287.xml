	<article author="Heather" email="heatherruiz21@gmail.com" city="Fresno" provst="California" country="United States" month="7" day="18" year="2014">This hymn was given to my husband and I yesterday after losing our baby boy at 5 months of pregnancy. The hymn has been with me as I've reflected on what beauty has come of a dire situation already. The Lord knows so many things that we don't see and He knows what we need for us to be drawn closer to Him. Of course I am sad that I've lost my first born but I am reminded and I've experienced that EVERY situation is an opportunity to turn to the Lord and grow in Him.

So Your life I'll display 
In every way"</article>

We might be embittered and may not understand, but these are necessary for the breaking of our self. By the Lord's arrangement, one day we will realize that only He is precious and that our eyes should only be set to Him. Once we are dealt with by the Lord, we will realize that all those times, what He desired is for our hearts to be turned back to Him until we become absolute toward Him. May we all have an intimate, sweet, personal, and affectionate relationship with our Lord. May all our experience lead to praises to Him.</article>

	<article author="Chris Roca" email="" city="Orlando" provst="FL" country="United States" month="6" day="20" year="2010">I can really relate to the feeling being expressed here through the words. In the beginning it starts with "unanswered questions" and ends with "Lord, though I still don't understand, keep me enjoying You".

There are times in my life
When my heart is embittered.
There are questions unanswered,
Yet, You're drawing me
To enter
Into Your blessed sanctuary
And turning my eyes heavenward,
The questions of constant inquiry
Are changed to these Whom do I have in heaven
But You, dear Jehovah.
My flesh and my heart
Constantly fail,
But God's still
The strength of my heart and my portion;
To Him forever I'll draw near.
I've made Jehovah my sweet refuge.</article>

	<article author="Anonymous" email="" city="" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="4" day="20" year="2009">I was upset with the saints the other day and I left the meeting with tears streaming down my face. A brother, who saw what happened, chased after me all the way to bus stop and was literally trying all sorts of tricks to pacify me. It was hilarious - I would never imagine a brother trying to mollify another brother - it reminds me of a boyfriend trying to placate his girlfriend after upsetting her.
Even though we never ended up have a heart to heart talk (I jumped onto a bus despite his efforts), I really appreciate his sincerity and his apologetic way of finding out the reasons I got upset...</article>

	<article author="Regan Ryan" email="" city="Hamilton" provst="" country="New Zealand" month="10" day="31" year="2008">Who do we really have but Jesus? 
God is love and we are made in His image, so what every human being wants and needs is love. What every human being is scared of is a love that ends, is a love that is conditional. What I still find hard to get my head around (because it's so hard to understand from a human perspective) is that Jesus loves us, so much, and He will never stop loving us for all eternity no matter what we do. This love is amazing and when the world tries to hurt us we can hide in this love, because with this love what need do we have of the things in the world? How can the world satisfy us when we have the love of God, His grace, His peace? 
Truly there is no substitute. :)</article>
