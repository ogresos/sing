Here are the other verses: 

Alone with thee, amid the mystic shadows,
The solemn hush of nature newly borne;
Alone with Thee in breathless adoration,
In the calm dew and freshness of the morn.

Still, still with Thee! as to each newborn morning
A fresh and solemn splendour still is given;
So does this blessed consciouness awaking
Breathe each day nearness unto Thee and heaven.
