In Luke 9:23-24 the Lord says, "And He was saying to them all, "If anyone wishes to come after Me, he must deny himself, and take up his cross daily and follow Me. "For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake, he is the one who will save it.â€¦" We may be believers but not true disciples unless we receive and embrace this way of living and being. If our Lord and Master went this path we should not expect to do less. Oh, What a Savior!</article>

I avoided it in fact. Then I listened to the words on the Lord of Glory CD and because of my situation, my heart was open and willing to pray with the words because the verses of the song are a prayer. 

How the Lord would answer that prayer I do not yet know. I only hope that someday fragrance would diffuse, cheering wine would flow, oil would be bestowed, and the Lord would be pleased that it is so.</article>
	<article author="Michael Manzullo" email="mjmanzullo@gmail.com" city="Changshu" provst="Jiangsu" country="China" month="8" day="3" year="2013">It is not easy to explain in words how this hymn has touched me. I have listened to it more than 50 times, recently. Each time is fresh, living and more than "touching." Yet each time I sense our dear Lord Jesus is searching me deeper and working Himself deeper into me by graciously allowing my to experience the reality of these words, practically. His light infuses us with His light! Just Himself. As I sing the words, both alone and with other dear saints, I feel refreshed, watered, and "lifed." Amen!</article>
	<article author="Sis LC" email="" city="Hamilton" provst="" country="New Zealand" month="7" day="8" year="2012">Amen. What an encouraging hymn for times of hardship. "Each blow I suffer is true gain to me". Our situation is merely the pressure to produce the oil to anoint others. The crushing of ourselves is so that His fragrance can diffuse. The Lord has measured out the amount of sufferings we should take so that His ministry may be produced. We must praise the Lord! And not shrink from this portion. Thank the Lord and praise Him for our situations! Perhaps we praise with tears, but Lord, we want nothing else.</article>
	<article author="Boaz Leong" email="" city="Manila" provst="" country="Philippines" month="10" day="22" year="2009">"Thou hast made Thyself more precious than all else to me: Thou increase and I decrease, Lord - this is now my only plea." Be more precious to me...Do increase!

"In the place of what Thou takest Thou dost give Thyself to me." This line is so wonderful. He takes away but in return He gives us something more precious - Himself.</article>
	<article author="Isaiah Tor" email="" city="Sydney" provst="NSW" country="Australia" month="8" day="15" year="2008">The writer of this hymn portrays the crucified life in a most subjective way, without a hint of self-pity or introspection. The flavour of its utterance bespeaks the deeply wrought dealings of the cross to a degree that matches the Lord's heart for us to be conformed to His death in every single way. This hymn is not a dirge, but a detailed experiential exposition of the Christian life under the cross to a degree where the tone of the last verse is that of heartfelt praise and even boasting in the hope of fully expressing Christ. To enter into the sentiment of this hymn requires a full departure from and denial of the self, to the extent where our only interest is that Christ would be fully increased in us in every way, for the ministry.</article>
