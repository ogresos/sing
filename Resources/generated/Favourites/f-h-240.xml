	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="26" year="2008">We often have the sense at the end of the Lord's table meeting that everyone wishes the meeting could continue. At such a time, without waiting for the brothers to call a hymn, everyone may spontaneously begin to sing, "Glory, honor, praise and power, / Be unto the Lamb forever! / Jesus Christ is our Redeemer, / Hallelujah! Hallelujah! / Hallelujah! Praise ye the Lord!" (Hymns, #240). In this way, everyone leaves singing. This is an example of sending people off.
