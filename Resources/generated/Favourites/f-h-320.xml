	<article author="Paul Nicholas" email="pnpontour@gmail.com" city="Coolum Beach" provst="Queensland" country="Australia" month="8" day="29" year="2013">I own this song. It speaks my story in every way. Saved by His tender mercy and grace He lifted me from the miry clay and sinking sand of self and sin.
Loved singing it as a kid 60 years ago and love it more now after spending many prodigal years in the pig pen. God has lifted me to plains of light from drug addiction, adultery and other pig pen activities. O praise His name He lifted me!</article>
	<article author="Michael Moore" email="revmikemoore@centurytel.net" city="Morris Chapel" provst="TN" country="United States" month="7" day="21" year="2013">Each of the above comments do so reflect my own love for this beloved hymn. Until I found this page, I had thought I was alone and probably the only person who had such an affinity for this hymn. It is so meaningful to me, for it tells my own story of grace so vividly. Brother Eddie George Anderson was our music director at Woolmarket Baptist Church in Biloxi, MS during part of my father's tenure as pastor of that beloved church. He probably sang this hymn as much or more as a solo prior to Dad's preaching than any other selection. I was just a young boy during that time, not long saved and in the kingdom of the Lord when I first heard Brother Eddie sing it. However, from the first time I heard him sing it, it sounded to me as though the angel Gabriel was leading a heavenly chorus of praise to our dear Lord. I thought then how much those words fit my personal testimony. Little did I know then, some forty plus years ago, just how meaningful those lyrics and that heart touching melody would be to me through every valley and mountain I would pass through. I could never sing it like Brother Eddie or any of the gifted singers who have recorded this jewel of hymns. However, one day after awhile, I will, in my broken, cracked voice, sing it with pleasure and with a most grateful heart to my Lord, face to face as I kneel in humble adoration in His presence. I have sang it countless times to Him by faith here below, but someday, face to face. I only hope my humble rendition will be a fitting sacrifice of praise to our beloved Jesus! Thank you so much for adding this precious hymn to your collection.</article>
	<article author="Kofi Owusu" email="owusukofiowusu@gmail.com" city="Accra" provst="" country="Ghana" month="1" day="29" year="2013">This is one of my favorite hymns. It expreses to me exactly what Jesus has done for me. Somehow I normally I am unable to sing through all the verses without shedding a tear. O praise His name He lifted me and made me belong to His kingdom of priests and a holy nation. (Exodus 19:6).</article>

O, Love that Wilt Not Let Me Go
(by George Mattheson, the blind preacher)


O Love that wilt not let me go,
I rest my weary soul in thee;
I give thee back the life I owe,
That in thine ocean depths its flow
May richer, fuller be.

O light that followest all my way,
I yield my flickering torch to thee;
My heart restores its borrowed ray,
That in thy sunshine’s blaze its day
May brighter, fairer be.

O Joy that seekest me through pain,
I cannot close my heart to thee;
I trace the rainbow through the rain,
And feel the promise is not vain,
That morn shall tearless be.

O Cross that liftest up my head,
I dare not ask to fly from thee;
I lay in dust life’s glory dead,
And from the ground there blossoms red
Life that shall endless be.

God bless you all.</article>
	<article author="Sabina" email="" city="London" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="8" day="7" year="2010">I like this hymn so much. I can play it the whole day and it still sounds so sweet to me. It reminds me that at some time I was in darkness wandering away from God. Titus 3:4-5 says "But when the kindness and the love to man of our Saviour God appeared Not out of works of in righteousness of the Law which we did but according to His mercy He saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit.Praise the Lord we are regenerated in our spirit by the Spirit so that we now have the life of God in us in addition to our natural life. This is the proper and perfect salvation that God designed for us.</article>
