	<article author="Joseph Butler" email="bjokul@aol.com" city="Joplin" provst="Missouri" country="United States" month="7" day="26" year="2016">Your site is wonderful! This hymn takes me back to my childhood, growing up in a small town and attending the small church in which I accepted Christ as my Savior at a young age during a revival. That is a memory I will never forget. A friend of mine urged me to go down to the altar and after I was there, on my knees, I felt arms around me, and it was my earthly father, who was crying as I was, and he asked "Son, do you know what you are doing?" and I said yes. Though I strayed over the years, I have always known that God is with me, and that through the Holy Spirit He hears my pleas and prayers, and answers them in His Divine Will. Praise God, praise God!</article>

I have sung/hummed this hymn many times in the past. Yesterday after I had mulled around a problem for some days it swung into my mind. I took a close look at the lyrics and sang and played it on my keyboard. Just beautiful. Verse 4 is particularly inspiring but the hymn as a whole is a complete prayer of surrender and dedication to God.

God granted me my request - He did much more than I requested of Him.</article>

It all happened as we asked, and we thanked Him for these.</article>

I have heard and have responded to His call through repentance, baptism in water and the infilling of the Holy Ghost. I am His and He is mine.  Very soothing to the soul. Working and listening to this song brings me peace. Love the fact that the song is replayed and I do not have to keep returning to click replay. Turn it on leave. Beautiful.</article>
	<article author="Phillip Vietri" email="pfv@vodamail.co.za" city="Port Elizabeth" provst="Eastern Cape" country="South Africa" month="3" day="18" year="2013">I am a Catholic priest and choirmaster, but I have loved Fanny Crosby's hymns from my youth. I have always been moved by the story of her reply to someone who asked, if she had her life over, whether she would choose to see. As I remember her reply: "No, sir, I would choose to be blind; for the first thing I shall see, when I get to heaven, is the face of Him who died for me." Her blindness played a significant part in her hymn lyrics. For example, in Blessed Assurance: "Visions of rapture burst on my sight, or To God be the Glory: "...our wonder, our rapture, when Jesus we see!" And, of course, the present hymn: "...Ere thee face to face I see." What a love for the Divine Saviour she had, and to how many people has that love been communicated through her profound lyrics and the melodies of WH Doane.</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="3" day="14" year="2013">Fanny wrote this favorite hymn in Cincinatti, OH. She was visiting her friend and collaborator, William H. Doane, in his home. The sun was setting, and their conversation turned to the nearness of God. Crosby was touched by their talk and wrote the words of this hymn before she retired that night. Doane added the music in the morning. It may be that the "friend to friend" communion in the 3rd stanza is an allusion to Crosby's fine friendship with Doane. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>

How wonderful Christ can be in our lives, but our feeling is that we are still distant from Him. This distance is not because of sin, or something evil, but just the longing to pursue Him, to know Him further. May we treasure our longings for Him! "No one can come to Him, unless the Father draws him."</article>

I find joy in this hymn in that it encourages us to go on not just in denying the devil, but replacing the self in me with the Lord. I always pray that I am drawn closer and closer to the Lord and I do so I will be moved further and further away from the devil. Praise the Lord for these hymns, we should all strive to deny the devil and be drawn closer and closer towards our blessed Lord. Amen.</article>
