	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="6" day="23" year="2014">William Featherston(e) was born in Montreal, Canada, the son of Wesleyan Methodist parents. It is believed that he wrote this hymn in 1862 at the age of 16 right after his conversion. Information on William Featherstone is scarce. Apparently he sent this hymn to his aunt in Los Angeles, who encouraged him to have it published. Mysteriously, it appeared anonymously in "The London Hymnbook", published in 1864. It is reported that the original poem in the boyish handwriting is still cherished by the family. Featherstone died at the early age of 27. The simplicity of loving the Lord in youth is demonstrated in this hymn. - Songs of the Spirit by Martin
------------------
The original says "My Jesus" instead of "Lord Jesus" throughout.
In the 1st stanza the original said "follies" instead of "pleasures". 
The last stanza, 1st 2 lines says:
In mansions of glory and endless delight,
I'll ever adore Thee in heaven so bright;</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="6" day="23" year="2014">A Protestant Episcopal Bi­shop of Mi­chi­gan once re­lat­ed the fol­low­ing in­ci­dent to a large au­di­ence in one of the Rev. E. P. Ham­mond’s meet­ings in St. Lou­is. “A young, tal­ent­ed and ten­der-heart­ed ac­tress was pass­ing along the street of a large ci­ty. See­ing a pale, sick girl ly­ing up­on a couch just with­in the half-open door of a beau­ti­ful dwell­ing, she en­tered, with the thought that by her vi­va­ci­ty and plea­sant con­ver­sa­tion she might cheer the young in­va­lid. The sick girl was a de­vot­ed Christ­ian, and her words, her pa­tience, her sub­mis­sion and hea­ven-lit coun­te­nance, so dem­on­strat­ed the spir­it of her re­li­gion that the ac­tress was led to give some ear­nest thought to the claims of Christ­i­an­i­ty, and was tho­rough­ly con­vert­ed, and be­came a true fol­low­er of Christ.

She told her fa­ther, the lead­er of the the­a­ter troupe, of her con­ver­sion, and of her de­sire to aban­don the stage, stat­ing that she could not live a con­sis­tent Christ­ian life and fol­low the life of an ac­tress. Her fa­ther was as­ton­ished be­yond mea­sure, and told his daugh­ter that their liv­ing would be lost to them and their bu­si­ness ru­ined, if she per­sist­ed in her re­so­lu­tion. Lov­ing her fa­ther dear­ly, she was shak­en some­what in her pur­pose, and par­tial­ly con­sent­ed to fill the pub­lished en­gage­ment to be met in a few days. She was the star of the troupe, and a gen­er­al fa­vo­rite. Ev­ery prep­a­ra­tion was made for the play in which she was to ap­pear. The ev­en­ing came and the fa­ther re­joiced that he had won back his daugh­ter, and that their liv­ing was not to be lost. The hour ar­rived; a large au­di­ence had as­sem­bled. The cur­tain rose, and the young ac­tress stepped for­ward firm­ly amid the ap­plause of the mul­ti­tude.

But an un­wont­ed light beamed from her beau­ti­ful face. Amid the breath­less si­lence of the au­di­ence, she re­peat­ed:
‘My Jesus, I love Thee, I know Thou art mine;
 For Thee all the follies of sin I resign;
 My gracious Redeemer, my Saviour art Thou;
 If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, ’tis now.’
This was all. Through Christ she had con­quered and, leav­ing the au­di­ence in tears, she re­tired from the stage, ne­ver to ap­pear up­on it again. Through her in­flu­ence her fa­ther was con­vert­ed, and through their unit­ed evan­gel­is­tic la­bors ma­ny were led to God.” - Sankey's Story of the Gospel Hymns</article>

Although it is heart-wrenching, even chilling to imagine in some ways, what these faithful people endured, it is also awe-inspiring and greatly encouraging to consider their steadfast faith in the God who brought them through it, all the way, to His Kingdom in Glory.
It is also so uplifting to read the comments from brothers and sisters around the globe, in places far and wide. And to think, this hymn was written by a 16-year old believer! Lord Jesus, I love You!</article>

My Jesus I love Thee, I KNOW Thou art mine.. what a testimony - and to think we shall meet those who were martyred for their faith in glory.

	<article author="Elizabeth Phillips" email="" city="Spokane" provst="Washington" country="United States" month="8" day="3" year="2013">Norma C. Fay, thank you for sharing your story. I was deeply touched. What a beautiful witness for Christ these believers were!! Truly, they gloried Christ in death.... and loved Him to their very last breath: "....and say when the death-dew lies cold on my brow, 'If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus 'tis now!". The testimony you shared of their courage (given to them by the Holy Spirit's power in their lives) has encouraged me greatly to stand strong in Christ no matter what comes my way. WHAT A SAVIOUR WE HAVE!!!</article>

	<article author="Norma C. Fay" email="" city="Colorado Springs" provst="CO" country="United States" month="6" day="7" year="2012">My just deceased Aunt, Ella Ruth Hutson, who arrived in China in 1948, to begin what would be a 40 year career as a Missionary, tells the following story about this hymn. 
Although she was not present at this particular locale, when the Christian Missionaries were expelled from China at the time of the Communist take-over, she was told this story by missionaries who witnessed it. 
At one area, where there was a young, but thriving church, the missionaries and the Chinese Christians were rounded up and taken outside the city. The Chinese converts were given the opportunity to recant their Faith. I don't know if any did, but many did not. Those who did not recant were then forced to dig their own mass grave, while the foreign missionaries were forced to watch. Sometime in the labor, a Chinese Believer started singing " My Jesus, I love Thee, I know Thou art mine..." and it was taken up by the whole group of Believers. They sang this hymn over and over, as they completed the digging of their mass grave, and were forced into the pit, with women and children. Then, they continued singing it as the dirt was thrown into the pit to bury them alive. The last sound heard from the mass grave was this hymn being sung with the last breaths of the Chinese Believers who saw their Jesus that day.  
My aunt went on to serve the remainder of her career in the island of Taiwan, sharing the Gospel of Christ, and extending the Kingdom of God. She retired in 1991, from 40 years of service to her Lord. She went Home to be with Him Last Sunday, June 3rd, 2012.</article>
