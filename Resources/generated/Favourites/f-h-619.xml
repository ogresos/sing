	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="4" day="4" year="2014">Sir John Bowring was born at Exeter, England. He could speak fluently in 22 languages and carry on a conversation in 100. He was consul of Hong Kong (1849-1853) when the Opium War broke out and later was the Governor of Hong Kong (1854-59). Bowring was closely associated with the Unitarians. The following hymn, which appears in many hymn collections today, does not appear in modern Unitarian hymnals.
Nearly 33 years after Bowring's death, during the Boxer rebellion in China in 1900, many missionaries were killed. One incident that occurred in Peking during this time is related to this hymn. After the siege of Peking was over, the missionaries gathered in the Temple of Heaven, the shrine where only the Emperor was allowed to visit once a year. The missionaries gathered around the marble altar of the heathen temple and sang this song which gave expression to the spirit that had sustained them during the previous weeks of suffering. - Songs of the Spirit by Martin</article>
