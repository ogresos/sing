Wade became famous for his artistic calligraphy, and he had a knack for copying music as well. Scholars have debated whether Wade merely copied this hymn or whether he actually wrote it. But recent scholarship indicates that he did, in fact, write the hymn.
It was originally written in Latin as "Adeste Fidelis." Wade was a Roman Catholic, and all services in the church were conducted in Latin. In 1750 he slipped this hymn into a manuscript he was copying for the English Roman Catholic College in Lisbon, Portugal. Over 30 years later, in 1785, it was sent to the Portuguese chapel in London. The Duke of Leeds heard it sung there and included it in the repertoire of his own singing group. It soon became known around the world. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton

Child, for us sinners poor and in the manger,
 We would embrace Thee, with love and awe;
 Who would not love Thee, loving us so dearly?</article>

O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant,
O come ye, O come ye, to Bethlehem.
Come and behold Him, born the King of angels;
 
Refrain 

O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
Christ the Lord.

Sing, choirs of angels, sing in exultation;
Sing, all ye citizens of heaven above!
Glory to God, all glory in the highest; 
  Refrain 

See how the shepherds, summoned to His cradle,
Leaving their flocks, draw nigh to gaze;
We too will thither bend our joyful footsteps; 
  Refrain

Lo! star led chieftains, Magi, Christ adoring,
Offer Him incense, gold, and myrrh;
We to the Christ Child bring our hearts' oblations. 
  Refrain

Yea, Lord, we greet Thee, born this happy morning;
Jesus, to Thee be all glory given;
Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing;
 Refrain

God bless you all.</article>
