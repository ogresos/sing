I knew right then and there that God was calling my brother in law home... When I walked in the door my Brenda told me he had just passed away and he went ever so peacefully. Rest in peace George, you are finally home.</article>

When I was 13, this was the hymn that was playing in the background during a Sunday night church service back in 1976. At that very moment, I felt the tug at my heart from the Holy Sprint and walked to the front by myself to accept Jesus as my Savior. Within, 5 minutes I felt a hand on my left shoulder and it was my Mother and I felt a hand on my right shoulder and it was my Father. We all accepted Jesus as a family!

	<article author="Bec" email="rebkar18@gmail.com" city="Melbourne" provst="Vic" country="Australia" month="3" day="11" year="2016">Such a beautiful song, I first heard this sung by Elvis Presley and this in turn has led to me looking up the lyrics. He sung a fair bit of gospel and this is one of my favorite.</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="10" day="22" year="2015">This hymn has a very good melody. And when you listen, really listen, to the words you realize that there's also a wonderful message. "Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling, calling for you and for me..." When it's put like that, beautifully and simply, is it any wonder that so many people have responded to the hymn and answered that call? - Tennessee Ernie Ford (1919-91)
Tennessee Ernie's version has stanza #3 and stanza #4 interchanged in order, which may be more effective for altar call, but the original order is as hymnal.net has it. Ernie says it should be played not too slowly, flowing easily.

167 Is there any here that doesn't have the Holy Spirit, has never been filled with the Spirit of God, you're not sure of your standing? Raise your hand, say, "I haven't received the Holy Ghost, Brother Branham." Have you received the Holy Ghost since you have believed? If you haven't, raise your hands. Would you like to come and kneel right here now, and let us pray for you, receive the Holy Ghost? Come on now while we sing.</article>
	<article author="Frank Pytel" email="fpytel@sbcglobal.net" city="Chicago" provst="illinois" country="United States" month="2" day="28" year="2014">The wonderful God of mercy brought to remembrance that special time of His calling, as I considered this hymn today. I don't know if He has a limit to His calling before He would let us go our own way. I repeatedly resisted the Savior, when a believer faithfully brought the message to me. Then one night as I walked away from the gospel message, I had the question, "What if this call of salvation in Christ never comes to me again?" That thought really made me afraid. That night the tender call of Jesus' love softened my hard heart as I was led to repentance and faith in Him!</article>

	<article author="Carole Etim" email="etimbasseycaroline@yahoo.com" city="Port-harcourt" provst="Rivers State" country="Nigeria" month="10" day="23" year="2013">The words patiently and tenderly just rends my heart. Sometimes we refuse the love of God and hold on firm to sin. And when we get to the end and begin to pay for our sins, we run back to Him with fear wondering if we still stand a chance like the prodigal son. Just when we begin to walk towards Him He runs towards us with open arms and takes us in. No matter how far we go, He patiently and tenderly tells us we've not gone too far to come back home. I love the Lord. I want to fulfill to the letter all that is written in God's book concerning me. I'm tired of crucifying Him over and over again.</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="7" day="10" year="2013">Will Thompson was called the bard of Ohio. From his home in East Liverpool, Ohio, he went to New York City to sell some of the secular songs he had written. Music dealers picked them up, and soon people across the country were singing "My Home on the Old Ohio" and "Gathering Shells from the Seashore." He made so much money from his compositions that newspapers called him "the millionaire songwriter."
But Thompson, a Christian, soon began concentrating on hymnwriting and set up his own firm for publishing hymnals. Two million copies of his gospel quartet books were sold. Sometime around 1880, when Thompson was 33 years old, he wrote this invitation hymn. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton.
When the world-re­nowned lay preach­er, Dwight Ly­man Moody, lay on his death bed in his North­field, Mass­a­chu­setts, home, Will Thomp­son made a spe­cial vi­sit to in­quire as to his con­di­tion. The at­tend­ing phy­si­cian re­fused to ad­mit him to the sick­room, and Moody heard them talk­ing just out­side the bed­room door. Re­cog­niz­ing Thomp­son’s voice, he called for him to come to his bed­side. Tak­ing the Ohio po­et-com­pos­er by the hand, the dy­ing evan­gel­ist said, “Will, I would ra­ther have writ­ten “Soft­ly and Ten­der­ly Je­sus is Call­ing” than an­y­thing I have been able to do in my whole life.” - Living Stories of Famous Hymns by Emurian

	<article author="Vickey" email="" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="8" day="28" year="2011">I love this hymn. It's woven into my earliest memories as a child. What a blessing to have grown up in an extended family who loved the Lord and went to church - teaching me of Christ. This hymn moves me with its sweet way of speaking to 'grace'.</article>
	<article author="Stacey" email="" city="Birch Bay" provst="WA" country="United States" month="7" day="20" year="2011">I am amazed and quite saddened that people are growing up these days IN THE CHURCH and not hearing the hymns. They are timeless and speak to a close walk with Him in a way contemporary music does not. It's just really sad. I have been trying to find the hymns as He has renewed my walk with Him and I so long to have nothing but Things of Him in my life. There are too many distractions as it is in life without allowing things like music to be one of them. I'm just clearing the clutter off my Path. A narrower path makes more room for His blessings.</article>
	<article author="Wendy" email="" city="Rockford" provst="IL" country="United States" month="2" day="6" year="2009">I recently heard this song for the first time at a funeral, and it reminded me of the short time we have to take Jesus as a Savior and go home to Him at the end. It has renewed a desire to find Jesus that I had lost after finding no inspiration after attending one of the more "modern" churches. Even though I am young at only 26, I find these classic gospel songs move me so much more than the new songs sung in churches.</article>
	<article author="H P Harvey" email="" city="" provst="Texas" country="U.S.A." month="8" day="1" year="2006">O come home! I love this song because of the powerful words spoken of Jesus' soft and tender love towards man. The Lord loves you and I so much and desires that all man would come to him; for it is He who will truly give us rest from our weary condition (Matt 11:28). The Lord has helped me so many times in singing, "Softly and Tenderly Jesus is Calling" because I can always come to His wonderful love and recieve His abundant mercy. I pray that no matter what my life holds, I can say at the end that softly and tenderly Jesus is calling.</article>
	<article author="Janice Rines" email="" city="Pasadena" provst="MD" country="U.S.A." month="1" day="20" year="2003">This is my favorite song. I miss my hometown church and one of the fondest memories I carry with me was the hymns we always sang in church. I was always a member of the choir also. There is great comfort in the familiarity of these hymns I grew up with. I guess I'm old fashioned or set in my ways as they say but the new music just isn't the same. I am so glad I found your site because now I have my very own hymnal through this site. I am so happy to be able to hear these songs, as well as see the words too. Most I remember, but not neccessarily every verse. I'm not sure why exactly but Softly and Tenderly has always been my favorite since I was a little girl. It's the comfort of knowing that He's always there and I have always believed He does call softly and tenderly and is always waiting for us to come home. Thank you so much for sharing your site with me and others. I can't wait to share this with my neighbor. I'm sure she will be excited as well. Thank you again and may God bless you!</article>
