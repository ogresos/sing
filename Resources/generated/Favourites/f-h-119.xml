He Is Risen' was written in the South, in the spring of 1876, and was first sung by Philip Bliss on Easter afternoon, 1876, in the Court House Square of Augusta, Georgia, to an audience of 5,000 people gathered to hear the Gospel. None who were there will ever forget the radiant face, or the triumphant, ringing tones with which he sang. - 'Memoirs of Philip P. Bliss' by Daniel Webster Whittle.
---------
Philip bliss was born in a log cabin in Clearfield County, Pennsylvania. The story is told that Philip soon developed an interest in music. At the age of 10 he was thrilled to hear piano music for the first time in his life. Listening for a while, completely entranced, he entered the house from where the music had come and sat enthralled. When the music stopped, the child who hungered for music cried, "Oh lady, play some more." However her response was to have him escorted from the house!
Philip left home at the age of 11 to work in the lumber camps. In the evening, he attended what was known as a "singing school", conducted by hymn writer William Bradbury. In 1850, at the age of 12, Bliss made his first public confession of Christ.
In the early 19th century, music training in America was largely centered on these "singing schools". Classes were often held in schoolhouses, churches or town halls and were organized by a person who traveled from community to community. 
The schools were often known for their strong spiritual emphasis. Many of America's early gospel musicians started out as "singing school" teachers. For over 100 years these schools had a profound impact on the quality of congregational and choir singing in churches across America.
In 1858, Philip Bliss was living and working in Rome, Pennsylvania. He boarded with the family of O. F. Young, and while living in their home he met and fell in love with their daughter Lucy. They were married on June 1, 1859. A year later, he began his career as an itinerant music teacher. During the winter months he traveled from place to place with a small folding organ. Then, during the summer of 1860, Philip was himself a student at the Normal Academy of Music in Genesco, New York.
Bliss met evangelist D. L. Moody in 1869, and the 2 worked together over the following years. Bliss was fast becoming a great singer of gospel music.
Bliss had a natural ability for both writing lyrics and composing music. He is credited with writing more than 100 hymns. During his short career, Philip Bliss earned more than $30,000 (a fortune in those days) in royalties alone. But remembering the poverty of his youth, he gave all but a modest livelihood to worthy causes. - Cliff Barrows, Choir Director for Billy Graham Crusades</article>
