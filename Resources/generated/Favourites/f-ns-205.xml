We can begin the day by deeply inhaling in the Lord and this name echoes throughout our heart the rest of the day. We simply need to heed this echoing - the gentle reminder from the Lord to keep turning to Him!</article>

	<article author="Esther Lee" email="" city="Folsom" provst="CA" country="United States" month="9" day="26" year="2008">My heart echoes this song exactly right now. What's interesting though, is this song comes to me after fellowship with other believers. If you don't feel clear or this song isn't reality to you, I encourage you to have more intimate fellowship and prayer with saints who can lift you up--in person. =) The rest of the day, you'll be supplied. This is my experience.</article>
