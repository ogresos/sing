But that's not all
Christ lives in me 
I once was blind but now I see 
It pleased the Father 
to reveal the Son in Me
That I become the same as He
Christ now is being formed in me
Till all my death is swallowed up in victory.</article>

Here is your portuguese translation. It isn't that hard. I just copied the song and went to Google Translate.
On the left side I pasted the version I wanted translated, on the right side I clicked on Portuguese and this is what I came up with. 
Good luck and may God be with you.
R. Grosinsky.

Eu tinha uma dívida que eu não podia pagar,
Ele pagou a dívida que Ele não devia,
Eu precisava de alguém,
Para lavar meus pecados.
E agora eu cantar uma canção nova marca,
"Amazing grace" durante todo o dia,
Jesus Cristo pagou a dívida,
Que eu nunca poderia pagar.</article>

Each time I think of this wee chorus I always think of that first service I went to and realise how much the Lord loves me. Thank You Jesus.</article>

He paid the debt on Calvary
He saved my soul and set me free;
I'm glad that Jesus did all my sins erase.
And now I sing a brand new song
Amazing grace the whole day long;
Christ Jesus paid the debt that I could never pay.

Someday He's coming back for me;
I'll live with Him eternally.
Won't it be glory to see Him on that day?
And then I'll sing a brand new song
Amazing grace the whole day long;
Christ Jesus paid the debt that I could never pay.</article>
