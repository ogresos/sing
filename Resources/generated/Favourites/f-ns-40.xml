Lord, draw each and every one of us just one step further. Save us from the mud our foot is stuck in right now. We need You to draw us to take the next step. Lord, don't let whatever we are going through be wasted. We just need You Lord. Thank You for the Body, the one place we must always go to seek You. Lord, we love You no matter how far away we are right now. Lord, draw us one step further right now.</article>

	<article author="Kaitlin" email="" city="" provst="MN" country="United States" month="11" day="27" year="2010">Woah! I just googled "draw me near to the burnings of Your heart, as that's what I've been longing for, and this song came up. So precisely what I've been contending for. This is powerful. Hallelujah Father. For everyone feeling hungry in a desert season, Father I pray that Your Spirit would bestow upon them beauty for ashes! Joy for mourning! Praise for heaviness! O God! Show Yourself strong. Reveal Yourself as the Faithful and True Witness! Hallelujah! Maranatha! Amen! :)</article>
	<article author="Sasha" email="" city="" provst="" country="Ukraine" month="4" day="27" year="2010">I learned this song before but recently the Lord gave it to me anew as my prayer to Him when I didn't know how to pray. I like the last stanza very much. It's about realizing the Lord is always present with us as the Body. Our need of Him and His need is met more fully when we are moved by Him to experience the Body of Christ more. I will seek Him there always! This is very high but normal in our experience, isn't it?</article>

Praise Him for His sovereign mercy! This song portrays the prayer of a thankful person to the Lord. Whenever I sing this song to the Lord, I can really feel His presence drawing me. It reminds me that He is everything I need and that He is ever present all the time.</article>

	<article author="Kathy N." email="" city="" provst="CA" country="United States" month="12" day="5" year="2008">This song really expresses the deep experiences of Christ. When He speaks, He speaks so softly, yet at the same time He burns within, the only thing we can do is stop and listen to what He wants to say. Sometimes He touches me about my thoughts and self-ambition and pride.. He is slowly exposing and burning them away. Whatevers not of Him, must be burned away. His Spirit is transforming me and saving me day by day. Lord, I just want to remain open to Your spreading in my being.</article>
