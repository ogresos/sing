	<article author="Jon Evans" email="jlevans3@verizon.net" city="Perry Hall" provst="MD" country="" month="5" day="4" year="2014">I had sung this beloved hymn as a child and then forgot about it. The Lord brought it back to my mind last month after an interval of almost 60 years. I will soon be sharing it with our senior adult Christian fellowship, most of whom are in their 90s, and wouldn't be surprised that some of them would know it. I appreciate the humble text which expresses that without Him we are nothing. The melody is easily sung because it is mostly stepwise and has the range of one octave. Thanks to Jane Palmer Baker for her comments cited below from more than 10 years ago.</article>
	<article author="Samuel SARPANING" email="dampare_2006@yahoo.com" city="Prilly" provst="Vaud" country="Switzerland" month="1" day="20" year="2014">Really I need Jesus. I need Him, I want Him, I am glad He made me with wonderful plans and purposes for me and He is with me to see me through the accomplishment of His plans and Purposes for my life to the manifestation of His glory and greatness to the whole world for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it, Amen. I am glad I have Him. He is with me now and holding my hand as I write. Seek Him for He is very near to you. How soothing it is to have Him. God bless you all. Amen.</article>

He was singing this song, which I had never heard before, but it was very appropriate, as my sister just went home to Heaven after more than 50 years of fighting rheumatiod arthritis. The words "no friend like Him in times of deep distress" were especially telling. Thank you for making this available!</article>
	<article author="Boxley Boggs" email="" city="Rowlett" provst="Texas" country="United States" month="7" day="30" year="2012">In my devotion and prayer this morning a deep sense of my need of Christ to live a holy life today came over me and this song came to mind. I love its message and its tune. I was happy to read the comments of the person who knows the song in Haitian Creole. My wife and I lived in Haiti for 14 years and love the people and the beautiful Creole language.</article>
	<article author="Elisabeth" email="" city="Miami" provst="Fl" country="United States" month="6" day="20" year="2012">This song reflects what I am going through right now. Others may think that they can carry their load alone but I need Jesus. I went to church tonight and this song was sang in Haitian creole. It is uplifting and motivating. I didn't know the lyrics in English, but in the Haitian song book, it tells you the English titles of some of the song and I look it up on line. I hope to sing it in my church this coming Sunday.</article>
	<article author="David" email="" city="Kampala" provst="" country="Uganda" month="2" day="15" year="2012">This song is a reflection on Christ our Lord and King. I need Jesus is so valid because without Him life would be a waste of time. He brought me up and took me as His own through grace. His love is omnipotent and He is truly the reason we all live. I encourage those that dont know Him to buy a Bible or just download some sermons and try Jesus. Your life will never be the same.</article>
	<article author="jj" email="" city="sj" provst="" country="United States" month="4" day="23" year="2008">i like this song because the tone is very uplifted for young people. i need to confess that i need Jesus to the End. he is the beginning and he is the end. 
no one like him in this world could forgive our sins no matter how great it is. our we need to do is to turn to the Lord and call him name: " oh, Lord Jesus! I need you. forever... and ever Amen&gt;</article>
