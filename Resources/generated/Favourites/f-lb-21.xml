How we recall where we were so full of darkness and we had one environment and one final destination. We lived in death and were destined for death and without any hope inthe drunkeness of this world. Then, hallelujah, in comes God and not in an ordinary way but full of light and so beautiful. what does He comes doing : attracting, loving, dispensing and transfusing. Hallelujah for the God of glory!!!!!! He does not stop there He goes on further to become the expression out of us and makes us glorious (The glory is His). How grateful we are to have such a wonderful destiny. Hallelujah!!!</article>

The God of Abraham is the God of glory. Stephen told us that when Abraham was called by God in Ur of the Chaldees, God appeared to him in glory as the God of glory (Acts 7:2-4a). God's glory is God Himself expressed. If God hides Himself, there is no glory. If God appears, if God is expressed, that is glory. God's glory in His appearance might imply a kind of splendor, bright and shining.
The God of glory in His first appearing to Abraham with His first calling and His first speaking was as a vast magnet and great motivation to Abraham, which moved him to come out of the country of satanic idolatry (Gen. 11:31). No one could stand against such an appearing, calling, and speaking.
Abraham was attracted, but Genesis shows us that he did not answer God's call in an absolute and willing way. It was not Abraham that took the lead to initiate leaving the world of idolatry. His father took the lead, and he followed. Actually, though, God was the magnet and motivation which moved Abraham to come out of the country of satanic idolatry. Abraham would not have made this move if God had not come to him as the God of glory. That drew him, attracted him, and motivated him.
