4. I love my wife so dearly,
My ear has been bored through,
His concepts and intentions
Are with the Church in view.
His love for her is in us,
The factor to maintain
Our status as the slaves that
We ever would remain.
5. I love, I love my children
I pour out all for them,
As members of the body 
Of Christ - the one new man.
With a concern for others,
A sacrificing heart,
Humility in service,
Pressed grapes do life impart.</article>

I belong to Him and not to this world. I desire to let Him live in me for my service to Him. I am learning to no longer live to myself, but to Him. I also love the church and all of the believers throughout the earth!</article>
	<article author="Peter Kim" email="todayif@gmail.com" city="Duluth" provst="GA" country="United States" month="10" day="4" year="2014">[Deu 15:16-17 KJV] 16 And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from thee; because he loveth thee and thine house, because he is well with thee; 17 Then thou shalt take an aul, and thrust [it] through his ear unto the door, and he shall be thy servant for ever. And also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise.
This hymn makes me cry ... Thank You God for keeping me abreast even when I tried to run away. I will not go away, Lord.</article>
	<article author="Jason Au" email="jas.au@live.com" city="Markham" provst="Ontario" country="Canada" month="1" day="7" year="2014">I really enjoyed this hymn even more after reading the chapter on Consecration in the New Believer Series by Watchman Nee.

Our consecration should be the issue of the Lord's love and the Lord's purchase of us with His blood. I've never seen these two aspects in this hymn until reading that portion of the ministry. This hymn even presents the proper attitude of service and the honor and privilege that comes with our service to Him.</article>
	<article author="Susan" email="slcuevas1@gmail.com" city="Sun City" provst="Arizona" country="United States" month="8" day="7" year="2013">I have now been saved for close to 60 years. My life's road has not been an easy one, much pain, loss and suffering, but my Master has been faithful and He has taken me through all the mountains and valleys. He has never left me nor forsaken me and draws me with His cords of love. I would not leave his service, His only would I be. I love, I love my Master I will not go out free.</article>

	<article author="Tanya" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="12" day="28" year="2012">It's a privilege to lose our freedom to serve our Master. How sweet and what a peace it is when He is able to possess us wholly!</article>
	<article author="Ruth Giesner" email="" city="Chalfont St Peter" provst="Buckinghamshire" country="United Kingdom" month="7" day="28" year="2012">When I reached retirement age in Christian work, I had my ears pierced as a sign that I would not stop serving my Lord. It's a great life when you love your Master, be encouraged and keep going.</article>
	<article author="Rebecca Berglund" email="" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="7" day="9" year="2012">How wonderful that there were many dear, hidden, little serving ones in history, pouring out from their hidden storehouse their very lives, their very souls, upon their master whom had gained their hearts entirely through His own dear love poured out (Ephesians 3:17). Those writing hymns such as these by Frances Ridley Havergal still speak to our hearts to move the stubborn will by being persuaded and captivated by His own dear loving self. Truly, wherever the gospel is preached there is still that flavor of Mary's offering upon the Lord (John 12:3), through other's captivation, to us, an inexplicably captivating scent, a perfume of love, that opens our hearts to receive His very heart into every part of our own.

A good biography of this hymn writer, Frances Ridley Havergal is written here: http://havergal.wordpress.com/about/</article>
	<article author="Marlon Tecson" email="" city="Caloocan" provst="Ncr" country="Philippines" month="4" day="23" year="2012">This hymn reminded me to come before the Lord because He is my Master.</article>
	<article author="L.C." email="" city="S.J." provst="M.M" country="Philippines" month="8" day="28" year="2011">"And in the weariest moments
 He gives the truest rest."</article>
	<article author="Lydia O.Saw" email="" city="Yangon" provst="" country="Myanmar" month="8" day="28" year="2011">I love, I love my Master. Yes, for us to serve the Lord, first we need to love Him. For me, every time when I sing this song, it really touch my heart and all my tears come out because here it says, "He save me from the bondage of tyrant self and sin and He chose me for His service". He chose me to serve Him before the foundation of the world. That is why I was serving the Lord since I was 17 years old. Now I'm already 25 years old and married, but My heart is still for the Lord. I'll never leave His service. Although sometimes I have worries and am tired but He always give me the truest rest. Lord, I love You so much as my Master.</article>
