I Googled the title and this site came up. Looking at the words oft this inspiring and very challenging hymn and reading all the comments make me realise that I need to die to self and clear the channel to be a clean vessel fit for the masters use. Thank you for sharing and I pray we all are ready to be channels of Blessings.</article>

	<article author="Debbie" email="dbgood@comcast.net" city="Brentwood" provst="TN" country="United States" month="11" day="7" year="2013">This hymn came to my mind today when reading the devotional book "God Calling" edited by A. J. Russell. I was reading the entry for November 7. It makes the point that anything blocking our channel is only of ourself (self). We must keep self out and ask His Spirit to flow through. As a result, others will be helped and drawn to Him from coming in contact with us when we are unblocked channels. Others are helped and blessed by His Spirit flowing through us. And as said above in the comment for May 16, 2010, we have to realize that we are not the blessing, we are the channel, just as Jesus says "I am the vine and you are the branches."</article>

It seems as if I change the channel when God places somewhere. Dear God, help me to not be disobedient to the Great Commission. In Jesus name, Amen.</article>

	<article author="Frank Pytel" email="" city="Chicago" provst="Illinois" country="United States" month="5" day="16" year="2010">As I was singing this hymn I began to realize that I am not the blessing. I am the channel. He is the blessing, and I am called to channel this blessing into others. I am "blessed with every spiritual blessing...in Christ" (Eph.1:3). May there be no resistance or hindrance, whatever it may be, to Him flowing freely through me into the lives of others! Wherever He puts me, may I be "a fragrance of Christ to God in those who are being saved and in those who are perishing" (2 Cor.2:15).</article>
