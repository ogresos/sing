I learned it at church growing up in Jamaica over 40 years ago. My mother used to sing this song at home a lot. The hymnal I use now does not have the hymn. I am really happy to find the lyrics and hear the piano music. Thank you so very much. I am very grateful that I could have all the lyrics because I did not remember it all.
God bless your ministry.</article>

Jesus! let all saints proclaim
  Its worthy praise forever.</article>

	<article author="Mark Beckloff" email="" city="Oak Creek Village" provst="AZ" country="United States" month="5" day="26" year="2011">The name of Jesus is so sweet. The more you use it in gaining His presence, the more sweeter it gets. You would think you might be able to wear it out, but it just gets stronger the more it is used to enter into our loving Savior. Sometimes I think I call too much on the name; but you cannot. Calling on the name brings me deeper and deeper and deeper into my alloted portion in Christ! That is: All the riches of God are being poured into me. HALLELUJAH!!!</article>
