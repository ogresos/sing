I like it because He is enthroned in the praises of His saints Sing aloud your praises to the Lord of All, Now He is dwelling in Jerusalem, Tell among us His doings great and small, His throne, the heavens, yet He walks with men.
Oh, the Salvation out of Zion comes;
He brought us back from our captivity
now we rejoice and are exceeding glad
Now we rejoice and are exceeding glad.

 All His delight in ZION does remain.</article>
