	<article author="Matthew Hearne" email="matthewlewishearne@gmail.com" city="Oklahoma City" provst="OK" country="United States" month="3" day="10" year="2014">I just found this hymn for the first time in my home meeting. I could not get through it without welling up. These lyrics remind me of just how horrible life was without Him being my head. Only then, did I "really" began to experience that He has chosen me. Hallelujah He has found us!</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="10" day="12" year="2013">In brief answer to Matthew 3/2012, Greg 5/2013 and James 10/2013 on why "blood" was changed to "life": I am not a spokesperson for the editors of this hymn, but I am a long standing member of a church that uses this hymnal. I personally do not agree with the change, but I can understand it. The reason "blood" was changed to "life" is because there is no verse that explicitly says we are saved by His blood. Blood takes care of the negative things. His life adds the positive things. We need both to be saved.
Rom 5:9 says "being now justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him" - so we are saved from wrath by His blood. That is worth singing about. Rom 5:10 says that we are saved by His life, having been reconciled by His blood - so actually we are saved by both His blood and His life.
Since we need both His blood and His life to be saved, it is fine to say "saved through His blood" as well as "saved through His life". "Saved through His blood" is better in this song because it is a prerequisite to being saved through His life, and if you take "blood" away here, then neither the Lord's blood nor death is mentioned in the song. Abundant life is the result in the last verse.</article>

	<article author="hn" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="5" day="5" year="2013">Dear Greg, the change was made in reference to Romans 5:10: "...much more we will be saved in His life, having been reconciled".</article>
	<article author="Greg" email="pilgrimgsj@gmail.com" city="Omaha" provst="Nebraska" country="United States" month="5" day="5" year="2013">I am puzzled that the word blood was exchanged with the word life, in the chorus. It is by the shedding of His blood I am saved. 
I look forward to hearing from you.

	<article author="Annie Inventor" email="annieinventor@yahoo.com" city="" provst="" country="Philippines" month="2" day="16" year="2013">A song that fills my spirit and meditate right then. Praise God for His faithfulness!</article>
	<article author="Matthew" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="10" year="2012">Hey I just noticed that you substituted blood in the chorus for life 
and I wanted to know why you felt the need to do that? 
although it is true that we are currently being saved as we are being led to glory as He is not only the Author but the Finisher of our faith, but the song is more primarily speaking of the atonement which was wrought through His death by which our sins are forgiven. The blood is a very important doctrinal point which the apostles frequently refer back to in the epistles, namely Paul in Romans, the author of Hebrews, etc. I dont feel that it is necessary or appropriate to omit it.</article>

	<article author="Bro, Benjie T. Arroyo" email="" city="Ekklesia Sa Mandaluyong" provst="Metro Manila Phillipines" country="Philippines" month="4" day="26" year="2010">John 10:10 tells us that the Lord comes for us to have Him as life and have it abundantly. In John 6 the Lord fed the 5000 people showing that Jesus knows that we are longing for something that can satisfy us yet we do not know that only the Lord can satisfy us. Maybe we seek education, pleasure, money, success but still we are so dry. All of these cannot fill us; we are still unsatisfied. We don't have tomorrow we only have today. We need JESUS!!!!!</article>
