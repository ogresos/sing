	<article author="" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="9" day="15" year="2002">Hallelujah for the Lord's life in us! The Lord Jesus is so worthy of our praises! His life divine saves us to the uttermost, hour by hour, saving us from more than sin - from our self, our murmurings, reasonings, and everything both negative and positive that issues from the tree of knowledge!

I enjoy verse 5:
He's pledged to save us to the full,
His life is operating;
He's doing everything for us
'Tis all for our perfecting;
Our life's a failure at its best,
Only His life can stand the test:
His life brings full salvation!

I just have to praise the Lord - only His life can stand the test, only His life brings full salvation! Hallelujah - my life is a failure at its best! This is wonderful, although our life is a failure, His life can stand the test - Jesus is our victory! He is the wonderful One now operating in us and doing everything for us so that He may further perfect the mingled life within and carry out His full salvation which He pledged to us!

Oh Lord, may we put aside all our vain efforts and LET Your life operate freely in us. May we obey this wonderful, inner-operating God whose very life is fully able to save us to the uttermost! What a wonderful Saviour is Jesus Christ our Lord!</article>
