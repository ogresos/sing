O the joy of having nothing, being nothing, and seeing nothing but a living Christ in glory. Hallelujah~~~Amen!!</article>

But really we don't have anything. All we have is the Lord's Word. It told me that we really don't have anything. I am glad that Jesus Christ died for us. May God Bless you and keep you in all that you do.</article>

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="31" year="2008">Recently I read a biography of John Nelson Darby. On the first page he says, "O the joy of having nothing and being nothing, seeing nothing but a living Christ in glory, and being careful for nothing but His interests down here." This was a word spoken in his old age, in which he longed to be nothing, to have nothing, and to care for nothing but to have only Christ and care only for His interests on earth. What a joy this is! Hence, "Be not and He will be; / Wait and He'll all things give." Through the generations there were saints who experienced this. Today we should have this experience even more.
