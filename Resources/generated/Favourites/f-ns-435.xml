It was the story of the boy who leave his father. Praise the Lord He's a good Father. He saves us from sin, He lives and died in the cross and resurrected,
He will get inside to live in our spirit. Thank You Lord that I'm a believer since I was a baby child to nine years old.</article>

The Good Shepherd leaves the 99 safely in the sheep fold to find that one lost sheep entangled in the brambles that's crying out from the heart. Thank You Jesus! Who can measure Your mercy, if we just cry out and repent of our backsliding!</article>
