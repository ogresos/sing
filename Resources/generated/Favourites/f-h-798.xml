    <article author="Tamara De Hart" city="Oceanside" provst="CA" country="United States" month="2" day="14" year="2012">Our being broken and living before the Lord, His being built within us, and the church being the expression of Christâ€™s Body cannot be faked. People can sense this immediately when they meet with us. Similarly, the condition of our locality cannot be faked. It is cold or hot, poor or rich, in the flesh or in Christ. As soon as people touch us, they will touch the inward reality. Nothing is as real as spiritual matters; they cannot be faked at all.

Some people are in Christ, allowing Him to rule in them and to overflow out of them. They are persons who are broken, restricted, and ruled by the Holy Spirit. When we come into their midst, we are released and freed, regardless of how heavy a burden or how difficult a situation may be pressing upon us. As soon as we enter into a meeting with them, our entire being is released and freed. This is because there is freedom in the fullness of Christ. If the Son of God sets us free, we are free indeed. Of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace. If we live in Him and allow His fullness to be expressed, there will be something in us that sets others free.
Church as the Body of Christ, The, Chapter 11, Section 3

May the Lord have mercy on us, revive us, and make us persons who live not by ourselves but by another life which is the processed and consummated Triune God as the seven-fold intensified life-giving Spirit.</article>
