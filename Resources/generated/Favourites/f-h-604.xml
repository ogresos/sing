This hymn makes so much sense to me. I recommend it as an effective elevating tune for early morning worship. I was taught this hymn as a pupil in Army Children School, Uyo, more than 25 years ago yet it continues to edify my spirit each day till date. What are we teaching our children today in schools? May God open our eyes to see that man shall live only but by the word of God. Amen.</article>
