    <article author="Mario Shaffer" email="mariobrothers598@gmail.com" city="Stockton" provst="CA" country="United States" month="12" day="29" year="2013">This is the desire of my heart--to relinquish all control and give Him every right and let the precious Lord Jesus shine on all the things that are not Him and to live His divine life through my human life by allowing Him to come in more into every space in my heart that is currently occupied by "good" things such as my loves so He would make home in my heart! This way His economy to make me the same as He in life and nature (but not in the Godhead) so I can grow to the stature of the fullness of Christ and be full functioning member of His glorious Body.</article>
