	<article author="Richard J. Rodriguez" email="richardtmew@yahoo.com" city="Henderson" provst="Nevada" country="United States" month="12" day="8" year="2014">Before I met The Lord in Santa Cruz, California in 1972..... I was so lonely and full of unrest....then one night He came into my heart...He really did! It was a Friday night love feast.... I came because I was hungry .... The young sister who invited me told me to "come because Jesus was there". And He was.
Today 12/8/14. I still sing this song....He is my rest forever and ever, Amen.</article>

Every time I sing it it fills me with such joy and assurance of God's love for Zion and I am immediately filled with hope knowing that my rest comes no other way then through my dear Savior. I am spontaneously lifted from worldly things to my eternal destiny chosen for those that love Him. Truly reason to shout for joy!</article>

The Lord is seeking for such a place. Heaven is His throne and the earth is the footstool of His hands. But where is the place of His rest? In the Old Testament it was the built up temple, the glory of God resided there. The temple was built at the special place, the mount of Zion, the elevation, beauty, glory of Jerusalem. Today Lord is seeking such a group of believers who are the beauty, glory, elevation (not elevated over other believers) of the church. "Lord, to You be glory in the church."</article>

	<article author="Mike Zamora" email="" city="Meycauayan" provst="Bulacan" country="Philippines" month="6" day="3" year="2011">We can fully sing this song while we are in the place where we found rest, the church, but Zion is not just the church but the beauty, the peak of Jerusalem which are the overcomers, the ones who are in the reality of the Body of Christ, a group of a perfected God-men living in a corporate manner. We can also sing this fully when we found where in the Body should we be, that is where the Lord as the ruler of the universe, the sovereign, resurrected and ascended Head, planned, arranged, and desired us to be. "This is my rest forever, here will I dwell, for the Lord has chosen Zion, He has desired it for His habitation."</article>
