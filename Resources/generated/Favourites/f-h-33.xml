God's everlasting Covenant is the same yesterday, today and forever. Praise Him for drawing us to Himself in His time and Providence.</article>
    <article author="Paul Tetteh" email="pwtetteh@hotmail.com" city="" provst="" country="Germany" month="11" day="2" year="2013">I am touched by stanza 3:
Godâ€™s compassion is my story,
 Is my boasting all the day;
Mercy free and never failing
 Moves my will, directs my way.
This corresponds to Lamentations 3:22-23 : It is Jehovah's lovingkindness that we are not consumed, For His compassions do not fail; They are new every morning; Great is Your faithfulness.</article>
    <article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="26" year="2008">The fifth step is the turning. For example, after the remembrance of the Lord, we need to turn to worship the Father. Sometimes the Lord's table has not reached the point of worshipping the Father, but a brother selects Hymns, #33; sometimes a brother selects Hymns, #101 immediately after the bread and the cup have been passed. Both are inappropriate. Hence, there is the need of a sixth step for correction. Sometimes a meeting may be quite long. For example, when a great number of saints gather together, it may take a longer time for the bread and the cup to be passed. If this is the case, there may be the need to maintain the spirit through a hymn or some prayers. This is the seventh step, maintaining the spirit for the meeting. Even though we use hymns and prayers to maintain the spirit, there may still be the need to fill up the time with more prayers and singing. This is the eighth step. Then toward the end of the meeting comes the ninth step to sing a concluding hymn. Sometimes even though the meeting has ended, there is still a lingering air; thus, we may select another hymn to send the saints off. This is the tenth step. This can be compared to sending off a friend who has visited you by walking a distance with him.
