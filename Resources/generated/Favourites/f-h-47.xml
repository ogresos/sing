3. There in the purpose of Thy love
Our place is now prepared,
As sons with Him who is above,
Who all our sorrows shared.

    <article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="4" day="7" year="2008">I love hymn #44 in the Chinese hymnbook. The first stanza says that we bless the name of our Father as children taught by grace and we rejoice that because of His life we were brought back to the flock. This is exactly what John 10 says. Once His life comes into us, it causes us to return to the flock. We were formerly lost sheep; it was by His life coming into us that we became sheep belonging to the flock and being shepherded under the hand of the good Shepherd.

    <article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="25" year="2008">J. N. Darby, one of the Brethren, wrote #47 in Hymns. It is difficult to find a similar hymn of such quality. The first two stanzas say, "Father, Thy name our souls would bless, / As children taught by grace, / Lift up our hearts in righteousness, / And joy before Thy face. / Sweet is the confidence Thou giv'st, / Though high above our praise; / Our hearts resort to where Thou liv'st / In heaven's unclouded rays." The truth in this hymn is truly high, deep, and penetrating. We must note here that when Brother Watchman Nee translated this hymn into Chinese, he improved upon the original English. Although the hymn was already very good, it was not so clear in its meaning. After passing through Brother Nee's translation, it is clearer.
