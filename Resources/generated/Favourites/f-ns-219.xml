	<article author="Madelene I. Camacam" email="" city="Santiago City" provst="Isabela" country="Philippines" month="11" day="15" year="2009">We can't deny the fact that the world tempts us constantly to live our lives contrary to the Lord's will, but I PRAISE HIM FOR HIS FAITHFULNESS, LOVE AND MERCY for not allowing me to turn my back to Him, but continually consecrate myself to Him and live by Him everyday. "Lord I long for Your presence always."</article>
