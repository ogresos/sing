	<article author="Toby" email="golfcart777@gmail.com" city="Cincinnati" provst="Ohio" country="United States" month="5" day="12" year="2015">I played my trumpet in Church for the first time several weeks ago and this is the song that the Lord gave me to play. Hadn't heard it in years. Did I mention that it was played in a Roman Catholic Church? I was floored afterwards. An evangelical song about Christ's saving &amp; cleansing Blood in a Catholic Church? Maranatha!!! Even so, come quickly, Lord Jesus!!</article>

The spirit of Bro. William Cowper will rejoice to see how the work of Jesus Christ at Calvary, His resurrection and ascension have been glorified and kept fresh in the mind of people of goodwill all over the world.</article>

Now I am preparing to serve Africa, die for all African and their recovery. I am Korean. So the mission is easy to me and i'm very happy to be with it. Because our country had recovered from Japanese imperialism, poverty and darkness without gospel. Thanks America, your missionary saved many Koreans from the curse of hell.
Thanks this song and Will­iam Cow­per.</article>
	<article author="Sue Pembe" email="bibijdh@yahoo.com" city="Mombasa" provst="" country="Kenya" month="11" day="27" year="2014">According to the scripture that was given, the harps are indeed scriptural. Go read.</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="4" day="20" year="2013">William Cowper suffered from deep depression for most of his life. In 1764 he found himself within the walls of an institution for the mentally ill. There in the asylum, William Cowper found Christ through reading the Bible.
Despite his emotional pain, or perhaps because of it, Cowper produced literature of amazing insight. He is still renowned in literary circles as on of England's greatest poets.
This hymn written about 1770 is based on Zechariah 13:1. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown and Norton

The original 5th verse is the same words, but reverse order of sentences:
Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
I'll sing Thy pow'r to save,
When this poor lisping, stammering tongue
Lies silent in the grave,
Lies silent in the grave,
Lies silent in the grave;
When this poor lisping, stammering tongue
Lies silent in the grave.

The beginning of the original 5th verse connected very well to the end of verse 4. This was followed by a final 6th verse:
Lord, I believe Thou hast prepared, 
unworthy though I be,
For me a blood-bought free reward, 
a golden harp for me!
’Tis strung and tuned for endless years, 
and formed by power divine,
To sound in God the Father’s ears
no other name but Thine.

Many evangelicals probably do not like the 6th verse because of the "golden harp". Without the 6th verse, the original 5th verse would end the song with "lies silent in the grave". Not an uplifting way to end. So the sentence order in the 5th verse was reversed.

I like the revised song, but I like the original better. The 5th verse takes you low and the final verse fills you with a special hope. I also like that the verse 6 ending does not have the repeat. It makes for variety and a fitting conclusion. Besides, the overcoming Christians are given harps (I think symbolic, which is the meaning Cowper gives it also) in Rev. 15:2; 14:2; cf. 5:8.</article>

	<article author="David Beach" email="" city="Beltsville" provst="MD" country="United States" month="4" day="27" year="2011">The lyrics presented here in verse five do appear to be the ones that William Cowper published, according to several sources that I researched. Note: There are some publications that make a small change in verse four, with the first line starting as: "For since by faith..." rather than "E'er since by faith.."
There is also an additional verse, sometimes used, which is perhaps better forgotten, as it cites acquiring "a golden harp." Such an unscriptural verse detracts from the sentiment of the song. As published here, it seems to encapsulate the experience of a "saved one:"
Verse one: seeing our guilt; Verse two: being washed; Verse three: salvation; Verse four: Faith; Verse Five: Eternity!</article>
	<article author="Cilvia Henfield" email="" city="Syracuse" provst="NY" country="United States" month="4" day="26" year="2011">As a child, I remember singing the last verse of this song differently. I remember seeing it different in the old hymnals. "Then in a nobler, sweeter song, I'll sing Thy power to save, when this poor lisping, stammering tongue lies silent in the grave. Which is correct???</article>
