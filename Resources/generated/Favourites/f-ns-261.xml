Every blessing as you do so.</article>

	<article author="WM" email="" city="BK" provst="CA" country="United States" month="2" day="27" year="2012">I like this song because...At the end of 1992, I was invited to a college gospel mtg with students from Cal state Fullerton, UCI, and Santa Ana campus. I heard this wonderful hymn for the first time, and I felt to be at the right place, right time in my life. I didn't want the meeting to ever end. The words of this hymn were so compelling when you are looking for answers about your human life. Praise the Lord for such an enjoyable song.</article>
