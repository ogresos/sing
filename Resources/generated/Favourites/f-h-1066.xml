In these mountains, and surrounded with such beauty, some of our best hymn writers were born. My love of sacred song has taken me to the birthplaces and villages of some of these. P. P. Bliss was born at Rome, PA. Ira Sankey was born at Edinburgh, in Western PA. Eliza Hewitt was born at Philadelphia. The Reverend Elisha Hoffman, author of this and many other hymns was born at Orwigsburg, PA.
Elisha Hoffman was the son of a minister of the Gospel, so it was not surprising that he, too, felt the call to that field of service after his own conversion. He attended Seminary at New Berlin, in his own state, and obtained his degree in 1866. That same year he married a beautiful young lady, who had nearly attained her 22nd birthday. Both of them loved poetry, and both of them loved to write. I do not find any of the writings of Mary Hoffman; however in the year 1876 Elisha wrote this hymn, which he called "Glory to His Name". That same year they published a booklet called "Happy Songs for the Sunday School." It contained songs that both of them had written, including this one. This hymn became a favorite in evangelical circles and is sung around the world today wherever Christians love to give glory to their Savior. 
That same year that this hymn was given to the many who had entered into Christ, Mrs Hoffman passed away. She was only 32. It was scarcely 10 years since their wedding day.
Rev. Hoffman joined the Evangelical United Brethren and took a pastorate in Lebanon, PA. Here he labored many years." - Hymn Stories by Wilbur Konkel</article>

He was very active in church his whole life and Down at the Cross is one of those old hymns he and we used to sing all the time at church. Listening and reading the lyrics has brought a flood of emotions for me and what my Dad was about. Thank you for allowing God to use you for me this morning.</article>
