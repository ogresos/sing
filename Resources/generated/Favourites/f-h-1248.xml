Lord we pray that You will defeat us, defeat us every day! Let us have a single heart for You to fufill Your plan, let us not love ourselves. we just want to take even more of You into our being, so fill us up. O Lord come into us. Lord let me not associate with worldly things anymore but love only You. Please cleanse my sins and I thank You for all that You have done for us.</article>

We should realized that many saints is doubling their effort even tripling their efforts for Building the house of God because we turned our back to the Lord. I am guilty for this and yet after hearing this hymn again and reading some comments from the saints it is like Lord here am I, send me for Your building today is the time. You shall have Your Home today not tomorrow. Today is the time to build Your house with the saints... We should not sleep until Your home is finished. I love You Lord! I love you brothers and sisters... Let us all build together the house of Jehovah our God. Today is the time to gather all the precious materials which prepares by the Lord Himself for His building. Hallelujah for Christ!</article>
	<article author="Frances" email="frances.escobin@gmail.com" city="Aberdeen, Proving Ground" provst="Maryland" country="United States" month="6" day="29" year="2015">This is a very beautiful and touching hymn that reminds us that we should not delay the interest of our Lord Jesus on earth. Most of us sometimes forget because we still are focused on our own personal interest even though we know and have clearly seen the vision the Lord had shown us. May the grace and mercy of God be upon each and everyone of us that we all may be built up together so we may be His corporate expression and be His dwelling place....His Home....and our home. Saints...Let us focus on what the Lord desire and hasten His coming. Lord Jesus we love You!</article>

	<article author="Epaphroditus Enoch Gadzeti" email="gadenp205@gmail.com" city="Ho" provst="Volta Region" country="Ghana" month="10" day="18" year="2014">God should give me a mind to recall how David swore to build a house for the Lord. It is my turn to go up to the mountains to bring wood to build the house. I must not waste the time because the hours are few. If really we love the Lord, let's pay the price to go up to the mountains to bring building materials for God's building. Hallelujah!!!</article>

	<article author="Lauren" email="liu.lauren@yahoo.com" city="Toronto" provst="" country="Canada" month="10" day="27" year="2013">I just returned from a young people's retreat, and we sang this hymn on the final Lord's day morning. For some reason, I was brought to tears. I have known this hymn for a long time, but had never payed much attention to the lyrics. The Lord simply wants a home, a family, a bride. I imagine how many times I return home from school, or from being out in the world, and I know how good it feels to be home. And this is all the Lord is longing for, but so many times I am concerned with my own needs, and my own desires. 

We need to let the Lord make his home in OUR hearts. 
The Lord is waiting for US to build His home. 

Lord, break through, overturn us
Lord, build, O build in us!</article>

I was really touched with the first stanza where he swore before the Lord. what an unselfish prayer! May we be those who pray, "Lord I want nothing for myself. I want everything for You and for the Lord's recovery." 

OUR ENJOYMENT OF THE LORD IS FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE HOUSE OF GOD, FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST!!</article>

	<article author="madelene I. camacam" email="" city="santiago citty" provst="isabela" country="Philippines" month="9" day="14" year="2009">Every time I hear and sing this hymn it always refreshes my heart to love Him and to desire for His building and I can't help myself but to consecrate again and again my being for the church. My husband and I sang this hymn during our wedding as our consecration to the church and until now this song always reminds us to go on gaining materials for His building. This preserves our heart up to this time to love Him and the church, not to waste time but diligently, absolutely and faithfully fulfilling His hearts desire.

	<article author="Hans" email="" city="Bacoor" provst="Cavite" country="Philippines" month="4" day="14" year="2008">Hallelujah...

I attended the "tour of a lifetime conference" held at baguio City Philippines. This hymn touched me so much deep within...

This consecration song, led me to my deepest part of being and when we sung this many of us cried. there is a life flowing when we had this hymn.

As in the hymn we are for God's building, we need to build His house. Build His house with us as He is our precious material. May most of us be touched to be inspired for His building. 

We are no longer blind and we are redeemed by God and He will put a restless caring in us.... May our Lord grant us the light to build up His House. Amen.</article>
	<article author="Pat Crozier" email="" city="San Antonio" provst="TX" country="U.S.A." month="10" day="12" year="2007">Because this is a song that touches the heart and conscience. The words speak of seeking a vision with utter and complete surrendered consecration to the Lord Jesus. It is a summary of the whole Bible from beginning to end. From Genesis to Revelation, God has desired to have a building dwelling place with man. Where am I with the Lord and how much do I really see of His goal?   The lyrics are more than beautiful; as is our Saviour.  Every true believer should have and experience in reality the words to this hymn. I sing this hymn over and over again to the Lord. It brings sweet tears to my eyes. How wonderful and marvelous that we, mere fragile humans, can satisfy the heart of God as David did.</article>
	<article author="Jonathan" email="" city="Brooklyn Park" provst="MN" country="U.S.A." month="9" day="6" year="2005">One night, while fellowshipping with some brothers late at night, we sang this song to the Lord. It touched me so deeply that, so often, I'm blinded, shut in with what concerns me while God's house lieth waste. The Lord spoke in those lyrics to me that my life is truly not my own to live, but His. I have a very long way to go, but I know that the Lord is there, constantly breaking through and overturning me in His own time according to His economy. Praise the Lord!</article>
