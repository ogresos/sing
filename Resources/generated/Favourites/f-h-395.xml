	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="12" day="9" year="2014">This beautiful Swiss hymn was penned by the 12th child of a Zurich doctor. Johann possessed a gifted mind, and he eventually became a leading pastor in his native city. Unfortunately, Zurich became caught up in the trauma of the French Revolution, and in April , 1779, invading French troops deported some of the city's leading citizens. Johann protested this action from his pulpit, and as a result he, too, was seized and banished. He returned to Zurich on Aug 16, 1799, but 5 weeks later was shot by a drunken French officer. He never recovered from his wounds, dying nearly 2 years later, but he left behind a deeply meaningful body of hymnology (700 hymns), including this musical prayer for spiritual growth. - Near to the Heart of God: Meditations on 366 Best-Loved Hymns by Robert J.

This hymn is usually sung to the tune of "According to Thy gracious word" #214 with the chorus as the 2nd stanza. It is harder to sing to tune 214, but it gives a different effect, letting the prayers of each stanza stick with you.</article>

	<article author="Maisha Parkar" email="skills-4-living@live.com" city="Round Rock" provst="TX" country="United States" month="7" day="21" year="2014">O Jesus Christ, grow Thou in me (we), 
 And all things else recede;
My heart be daily nearer Thee,
 From sin be daily freed.
True captivity is to not know Christ. When we know, grow and flow Christ...then we experience true freedom.</article>

	<article author="Efren Mazo" email="mylifechoice@gmail.com" city="Sydney" provst="NSW" country="Australia" month="5" day="26" year="2014">“The birth of Isaac was the coming of Jehovah, which was the coming of grace (cf. John 1:17). Isaac was born by the strength of God’s grace, not by the strength of man’s natural life. This took place after Abraham had been circumcised and he and his wife, Sarah, had become completely deadened (Gen. 18:11; Rom. 4:18-19), signifying that the time of life, the time when Christ will be life to us, will come after our natural strength has been terminated. (Gen. 18:14, footnote 1)”
