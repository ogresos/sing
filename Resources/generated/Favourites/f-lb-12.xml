The Lord doesn't want us to do many things or anything for Him. He wants us to keep in contact with Him, dating with Him and be deeply in love with Him.

Although this song is simple and easy, but........ it means a lot to those who serve Him and love Him.

It reminds me to love Him more... "Lord, I love You. I just love You." Amen.</article>
