As I continue to sing read, pray-read and ponder I realise how much I have frustrated the Lord and the urgency of going the narrow to gain the Lord and meet His urgent need. Lord I unreservedly give myself to you to go the narrow way.</article>

Without the experience of blood, you will never have an experience of oilment. No skip steps! I listen to this song again and again this whole week, I really feel the spirit of the writer, how his experiences in the Lord, it is so deep so deep. And actually this is the way exactly how we can touch the Lord more and more and to be filled by Him.</article>
	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="4" day="8" year="2008">We know that the Holy Spirit is the reality of resurrection. When you are in the Holy Spirit, you are in resurrection. Although resurrection and the Holy Spirit are closely related, in our subjective experience resurrection is even more closely tied to death. Our natural being with its natural strength and natural views must pass through death before we can enter into resurrection. Hymns #279 says, "First the blood, and then the ointment, cleansing, then anointing comes; if we pass not thru Golgotha, ne'er to Pentecost we'll come." If we do not pass through the death on the cross, we can never receive the Spirit at Pentecost because the Spirit at Pentecost is the reality of resurrection. In order to have the reality of resurrection, we need to pass through Golgotha.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="4" day="1" year="2008">A stanza of a hymn in our hymnal says:

When we see the ripened harvest
Of the golden countryside,
We may know that many seeds have
Fallen to the earth and died.

Before there can be a harvest, many grains need to fall into the earth and die. But who is willing to die? Instead of dying, nearly everyone wants to receive glory. Thus, no life is imparted into others. It is easy to have a crowd, but difficult to impart life into others. To do this, we need to die. This is my burden in this message. In the Lord's recovery we do not need a crowd; we need the death that releases life. We need to experience this aspect of Christ's death.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="31" year="2008">The objective cross must become our subjective experience. We need to get into the cross and the cross must get into us. In this way we and the cross become one. Our oneness with the cross is our salvation. To be delivered from the self means to be saved from the self through becoming one with the cross. Every day we should be conformed to Christ's death by the power of His resurrection (Phil. 3:10). Without the oneness with the cross, we cannot be delivered from the self. I appreciate the chorus of the hymn which says, "Through the Cross, O Lord, I pray,/Put my soul-life all away;/Make me any price to pay,/Full anointing to receive" (Hymns, #279). We need to be willing to pay the price to enter into the subjective experience of the cross.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="25" year="2008">In our hymnal there is an excellent hymn with deep spiritual significance on the relationship between the cross and the Spirit (Hymns, #279). Stanza four of this hymn says that we must go through the Jordan before we can be anointed from above, that we must be baptized in death before we can experience the Dove. Here Jordan signifies death, and the Dove signifies the Spirit. If we pass through the river of death, we will receive the living Dove.
