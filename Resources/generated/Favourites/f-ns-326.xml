Thanks for sharing. We need more grace, truth and life so that I can love the Lord with all my heart. I can't do without the word of God added into myself so that our God can make home into my heart. Loving the Lord with all our heart is matter of rejecting our own fleshly desire worldly enjoyment. It means that we should deny ourself and giving God as first place into our heart whatever we do and decisions in life. The more we touch Lord in spirit in the word the more we love Him. No more self desire of loving worldly pleasure; He will become our all and all.: kindness, peace, love, mercy, all good virtues is in Christ Jesus who is the source of righteousness.</article>
