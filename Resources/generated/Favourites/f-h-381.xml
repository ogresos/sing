	<article author="John Hartley" email="vicar@stluke-eccleshill.org.uk" city="Bradford" provst="West Yorkshire" country="United Kingdom" month="12" day="31" year="2015">Came across this hymn whilst searching the internet for hymns on the theme of "vision" - I had never come across it before. Two thoughts: (i) it could do with a tune that plumbs the heights and depths of emotions a bit more; and (ii) compared to the other two verses, line 3 of verse 1 is a bit of a dampener - I think an honest acknowledgement that we all go through dark times is good in a hymn, but somehow this mood interrupts the rise of verse 1, and I would have preferred it to come somewhere else in the hymn.</article>

She was saved in her early childhood and eventually attended Moody Bible Institute. She married E. O. Christiansen, who was affiliated with Moody Bible Institute for over 40 years. Mrs. Christiansen wrote many gospel hymns as well as several volumes of poems.

If we all prayed this prayer through until it was fulfilled in our lives, what a wonderful world this would be. Lord fulfill Your Word in us! In Jesus Name I pray!</article>
