	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="Michigan" country="United States" month="11" day="19" year="2015">"As I understand it, this hymn was written especially for sailors. You can almost feel the stroke of the oars and the roll of the sea as a shipwrecked crew tries to make it safely to land. The appeal of this song, however, could no more be limited to sailors than, say, 'The Ninety and Nine' could be limited to shepherds. The message is for everyone. 'Jesus, Savior, pilot me over life's tempestuous sea ...' Life is a stiff voyage through a storm - so help me, Jesus, pilot me, take hold of my ship. With you to guide me ... I'll make it." - Tennessee Ernie Ford (1919-91)</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="10" day="10" year="2014">Born in New York City, Hopper became a Presbyterian minister. After pastoring 2 Presbyterian churches in New York, he pastored a small church [Church of Sea and Land] in the New York harbor, ministering to many sailors. It was while he was there that he wrote this hymn anonymously. When asked to write a hymn for the Seamen's Friend Society, he instead read this already published hymn. It was then that the people, who already knew this song, became aware of its author. - Songs of the Spirit by Martin

There are additional stanzas between stanzas 1 &amp; 2 above:
2. While th’Apostles’ fragile bark
 Struggled with the billows dark,
 On the stormy Galilee,
 Thou didst walk upon the sea;
 And when they beheld Thy form,
 Safe they glided through the storm.
-----------
3. Though the sea be smooth and bright,
 Sparkling with the stars of night,
 And my ship’s path be ablaze
 With the light of halcyon days,
 Still I know my need of Thee;
 Jesus, Savior, pilot me.
-----------
4. When the darkling heavens frown,
 And the wrathful winds come down,
 And the fierce waves, tossed on high,
 Lash themselves against the sky,
 Jesus, Savior, pilot me,
 Over life’s tempestuous sea.
-----------
The original last stanza is different:
When at last I near the shore,
 And the fearful breakers roar
’Twixt me and the peaceful rest,
 Then, while leaning on Thy breast,
 May I hear Thee say to me,
“Fear not, I will pilot thee.”

Major D. W. Whit­tle told me the fol­low­ing in­ci­dent in con­nec­tion with this hymn: “I went with Gen­er­al O. O. How­ard to hold meet­ings for the sol­diers at Tam­pa, Flor­i­da, and one day while go­ing through the camp I found a young man dy­ing of fe­ver. I knelt by his side and asked him if he was a Christ­ian. He re­plied that he was not, but said that his fa­ther and mo­ther were Christ­ians; and he asked me to pray for him. I did so, but no deep im­pres­sion was made up­on his heart. I went away with a sor­row­ing heart and prom­ised to re­turn ano­ther day. Two days lat­er I vi­sit­ed him again and, pray­ing with him, the Lord put in­to my mind to sing, ‘Je­sus, Sav­iour, pi­lot me.’ The dy­ing sol­dier said: ‘Oh, that sounds good; it puts me in mind of my be­lov­ed sis­ter in Mi­chi­gan, who used to sing this hymn for me be­fore I en­tered the ar­my.’ He want­ed me to re­peat it over and over again for him, and fi­nal­ly he asked: ‘Will Je­sus be my pi­lot in­to the ha­ven of rest?’ I told the young man that Je­sus would. ‘Then,’ he said, ‘I will trust him with all my heart.’ The next day I called to see him again, but his com­rade said: ‘He passed away dur­ing the night.’” - Story of Gospel Hymns by Ira Sankey</article>
