	<article author="Francis" email="badoomtshhh@yahoo.com" city="Matthews" provst="NC" country="United States" month="11" day="28" year="2012">This song has lifted me up and reminded me that a large part of why I am so exhausted and stressed is because I do not exercise my spirit in God. I address the physical side of my life and the emotional side but seldom take time to address the Spiritual side of my life. Yet, it is the most important! Thank you for this song!</article>

	<article author="Hymnal.net" city="" provst="" country="" month="12" day="6" year="2012">When we compiled the hymnal, we did consider this matter of the "rind" and the "flesh." Since a watermelon must have both rind and flesh, we kept the "rind" hymns. However, we must learn to eat the "flesh," because the essence and nutrients are in the flesh. We must not eat only the rind. The saints seldom call hymns on experiencing Christ as life, such as Hymns, #841 and #501, or hymns on Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit, such as #450 in the Chinese hymnal and Hymns, #612. Some may not even know the tune to these hymns. We do not call these hymns, because we lack a vision of the treasure within these hymns. These hymns are on the riches of Christ who, as the all-inclusive Spirit, is in us to be our supply. Regrettably, the brothers and sisters do not know how to appreciate these hymns. They prefer to sing "rind" hymns.
