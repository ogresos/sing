	<article author="C Sawyer" email="" city="League City/Galveston" provst="Texas" country="United States" month="4" day="1" year="2010">We've been really enjoying seeing how wonderful the Lord's table is and how He is the victor! And after reading Psa. 22:29-All the flourishing of the earth will eat and worship. All who go down into the dust will bow down before Him, even he who does not keep his soul alive.

This additional verse was written to this tune:
Eat My body, Drink My blood now.
Do this to remember Me.
Bread and wine to eat and worship,
Christ Himself we will receive!
World and flesh are gone forever!
He's our portion, rich and sweet!

Amen.</article>

	<article author="Alvin Lo" email="" city="Hong Kong" provst="" country="Hong Kong" month="1" day="20" year="2009">A couple of days ago, this hymn popped out of my mind when I woke up in the morning. I thus knew that the Lord wanted me to praise Him. That whole day I was praising Him with this hymn.

We are nothing; but the Lord has overcome, resurrected, and ascended. Hallelujah! We should praise the Lord every day. Praising Him fires up our spirit.

"Triumphed on Calvary!"
"He displays His victory!"
"He shall reign eternally!"</article>

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="7" day="15" year="2011">Here is another example. When we feel oppressed, we usually call on the Lord's name and pray. Initially, we may call with a quiet voice, but our voice gradually becomes louder. When we cry out, our spirit bursts forth, and the oppression vanishes. Many saints have experienced this. Sometimes when we go to a meeting, we have a sense that the atmosphere in the meeting is not released, and we ask the Lord to release the spirit of the saints. However, such prayers may not be very effective. It is better to sing an appropriate hymn, such as, "Praise Him! praise Him! Christ is Victor!" (Hymns, #124). When the saints sing, the chains will fall off, and the atmosphere in the meeting will be released. There are times when we need to call on the Lord's name loudly, but we also need to be considerate of others. If it is late at night, we should not call loudly, or we may disturb others. If the environment allows, we should call on the Lord in a released way. This will help us to touch the Lord and experience Him.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="7" day="14" year="2011">Hymns, #124 begins, "Praise Him! praise Him! Christ is Victor!" Christ won the victory over the enemy by being a man. Toward the enemy He lived as a man on the earth, He is now sitting in the heavens as a man, and He is coming as a man (Mark 16:19; Acts 7:55-56; Matt. 26:64). Toward us, however, He is also the Son of God. The Son of Man is for His victory over the enemy, and the Son of God is for His being life to us. During His ministry on the earth, the demons called Him the Son of God (8:29; cf. 1 John 4:2-3). The demons are not afraid of Christ's being the Son of God, but they are afraid of His being the Son of Man. One day all the demons will have to confess the name of Jesus, who as the Son of Man is Lord of all (Phil. 2:6-11). Today we who confess that Jesus is the Son of God receive the divine life, but the demons, who must confess that Jesus the Son of Man is Lord, receive condemnation. To us Christ is the Son of God for life, and to the enemy He is the Son of Man for victory.
