In 1956, 5 missionaries in Ecuador tried to reach a warlike tribe in the jungles of South America. No one had been able to reach this tribe without being murdered. These men desired to make contact with these people in order to bring them the gospel. As 10 men from the tribe approached them on a secluded beach, they sang this song together. A day later, the 5 missionaries were all murdered. Less than 2 years later, Elisabeth Elliot, widow of one of the murdered missionaries, and Rachel Saint, sister of another murdered missionary, were able to live with this same tribe and bring them the gospel. Elisabeth Elliot later wrote the book "Through the Gates of Splendor", which documents the life and death of her missionary husband, Jim Elliot. The title for this book came from the original 4th stanza, 3rd line of this song. - Songs of the Spirit by Martin

The original 3rd line of the 4th stanza says:
