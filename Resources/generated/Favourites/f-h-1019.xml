	<article author="Betty Jane Bonn" email="" city="Dunlap" provst="Illinois" country="United States" month="11" day="19" year="2012">Earlier today I posted a testimony of how I was born again. This evening as I was studying, I came across this testimony by Charles Spurgeon that sounded so like my own. Though he expressed it so much more eloquently, the reality of being born again was the same. 
"When the Lord first pardoned my sin, I was so joyous that I could scarce refrain from dancing. I thought on my road home from the house where I had been set at liberty, that I must tell the stones in the street the story of my deliverance. So full was my soul of joy, that I wanted to tell every snow-flake that was falling from heaven of the wondrous love of Jesus, who had blotted out the sins of one of the chief of rebels. But it is not only at the commencement of the Christian life that believers have reason for song; as long as they live they discover cause to sing in the ways of the Lord, and their experience of His constant lovingkindness leads them to say, "I will bless the Lord at all times: His praise shall continually be in my mouth."</article>
	<article author="Betty Jane Bonn" email="" city="Dunlap" provst="Illinois" country="United States" month="11" day="19" year="2012">This song reminds me of my own born again experience in 1955 when I was 14 years old. The pastor gave the invitation for those who desired to receive Jesus as Savior to come forward. I had never before heard an invitation and so I just sat there in my pew weeping and weeping. The Pastor saw me, came down from the platform and got me and led me to the prayer bench at the front of the church. We knelt together and he led me to the Lord. With my spiritual eyes, I saw something dark gray absolutely roll off and away from me! Later, I came across the words of a hymn ("At the Cross", I think) that said, "And the burden of my sins rolled away." That truly happened to me! I felt so free! The next day as I walked to school, the sky seemed bluer, the grass seemed greener, the air fresher, the birds sang more brightly! I was a new creature in Christ and all creation seemed to be rejoicing with me! II Corinthians 5:17 came to pass: "Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold all things are become new." May Jesus Christ, my Savior, be praised and glorified forever and ever!</article>

	<article author="Daniel Owor Onyanya" email="" city="Kampala" provst="" country="Uganda" month="1" day="27" year="2004">This song reminds me of Jesus' ever watshful eye that makes him available to his children at all times. It does not matter what time of the day it is or how dark your own life is made by your sins. As soon as you reach his presence, be assured of full time attendance to your very own needs.</article>
