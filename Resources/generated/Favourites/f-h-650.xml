    <article author="Kaitlyn" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="7" day="3" year="2013">The title of this song drew me in; the words are o-so-very-very timely. In the wrestling match of questions, in the aftermath of trauma, in the midst of "WHY? O DEAR LORD WHY?" , these lyrics from long ago bring comfort to me today. Thank you so much for including them.</article>

Yet singing it in the Lord's presence, it became so specific. It could point to my hidden sin, my worldly pleasures, my resistance to serve the Lord, or even to my unwillingness to mend things with another person. As I continued singing, I knew what I needed to settle before the Lord. "Lord, I give up the struggle, to Thee commit my way."</article>
