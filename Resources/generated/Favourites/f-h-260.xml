I am typing this on the very fifth night. 

After singing 
I know His name Isaiah 9:6
And remixes to: I use His name

And as songs came in....
At a special time the spirit sang this one:

Showers of blessings 

Of a truth
Nigeria is in for an experience
We must pray and wait......
2 Chronicles 7:14-15
"If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land. Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the prayer that is made in this place."</article>

Really my family and I need showers of blessings as well as every believer. God's blessing comes in so many forms but it is gratifying to note that even the mercy drops that fall on us is so great and refreshing. So as we pray for showers, God will surely rain it down on us and it will be a great year. May God's name be praised for this wonderful provision. Amen.</article>
	<article author="Banjo Olusegun" email="banjolusegun@yahoo.com" city="Ikeja" provst="Lagos" country="Nigeria" month="12" day="17" year="2013">This song preached to me that most times Christians seek for SHOWERS OF BLESSINGS but often times God tried us 1st with mercies &amp; drops of blessings round us to see how THANKFUL we are with LITTLE BLESSINGS but most times we are very UNGRATEFUL &amp; UNTHANKFUL yet we continue to pray, pleading for SHOWERS OF BLESSINGS that will never come to any UNTHANKFUL, UNAPPRECIATIVE, UNGRATEFUL CHILD OF GOD. 

Truly "Mercy-drops round us are falling,
  But for the showers we plead"

BE THANKFUL TO GOD 1ST 4 D MERCY-DROPS OF BLESSINGS ROUND YOU THEN "THERE SHALL BE SHOWERS OF BLESSINGS"...AMEN.</article>

	<article author="Pcvh" email="" city="Sinacaban-Evansville" provst="" country="" month="2" day="19" year="2010">Just like the children of Israel in Zech 10:1 "Ask rain of Jehovah / At the time of spring rain, / Of Jehovah who makes the lightning, / And He will give them showers of rain, / To everyone herbage in the field". Rain signifies blessings.To ask for more rain is to seek more blessing. Thus, in this verse the Lord is encouraging the children of Israel to seek more blessings while He would be favorable to them. While the Lord is so favorable to us, we should ask Him to send us even more favor. Since God is giving us showers of rain, we should ask Him for more rain. This indicates that we all need to pray for the Lord's abundant blessing.</article>
