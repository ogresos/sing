I'm not a Christian, but I still maintain my theistic belief and am grateful for all the positive things God had given to my friends and I. May all believers be blessed by our Creator Himself.</article>

We can't explain why God loves us; we just know that He does by His grace and mercy. I'm grateful for conviction by the Holy Ghost and salvation through Jesus! How wonderful that the chorus comes straight from the King James Version of the Bible!</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="7" day="15" year="2013">As a POW during the Civil War, Daniel Whittle began reading the New Testament his mother had given him as he marched off to war, and he committed his life to Jesus Christ.
After the war, Whittle was promoted to the rank of major and then became a successful businessman. In 1873 he began preaching in evangelistic services, and for a quarter-century he led revivals throughout the United States. He also encouraged some of the leading songwriters of his time and wrote many hymns himself, including "Showers of Blessing" and "Moment by Moment." Whittle penned this hymn in 1883, perhaps thinking back to questions he had asked during his imprisonment. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>

	<article author="Pcvh" email="" city="Sinacaban-Evansville" provst="" country="" month="2" day="19" year="2010">2 Timothy 1:12
For which cause also I suffer these things; but I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that He is able to guard my deposit unto that day. 

footnote 1 : cause
 The apostle suffered for a cause, a cause on the highest plane â€” the proclaiming of the glad tidings of the gospel of grace and life to establish the churches, and the directing of the saints. Such a cause must have been an encouragement and strengthening to Timothy as he faced the deterioration of the declining churches.

footnote 2: not
 So Timothy should not have been ashamed either

footnote 3: whom
The apostle believed not a thing or a matter but a living person, Christ, the Son of the living God, who is the embodiment of divine grace and eternal life. The eternal life in Him is powerful; it is more than able to sustain to the end the one who suffers for His sake, and to preserve him for the inheritance of the coming glory. The grace in Him was more than sufficient to provide His sent one with all he needed for finishing the course of his ministry unto a reward in glory (4:7-8). Hence, He was able to guard that which the apostle had committed unto Him for the day of His return. Such an assurance must also have been an encouragement and strengthening to the enfeebled and sorrowful Timothy. 

footnote 4: my
 Or, that which I have committed unto Him. The apostle committed his entire being with his glorious future unto the One who was able, through His life and grace, to guard his deposit for the day of His second appearing.

footnote 5: that day
The day of Christ's second appearing.</article>

	<article author="Chalya Princess Miri-Gazhi" email="" city="Hull UK" provst="England" country="United Kingdom" month="12" day="29" year="2008">I was about 9 or 10 years old when I first heard this music sang by a sister in my church and I immediately fell in love with the hymn and now at 33, I am still moved by the lyrics and the melody of this song. It simply reminds me that God is always in control of my life and come what may - esp in this stress filled financial times of uncertainty, there is someone looking out for me!

Cheers
