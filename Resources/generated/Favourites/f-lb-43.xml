	<article author="Steward" email="" city="Sri Aman" provst="Sarawak" country="Malaysia" month="6" day="7" year="2008">Yes, I fully agreed with this hymn. Our Triune God is really a mystery,He is not for our mind to understand and to figure out how He is and what he is , his being Triune is for our enjoyment. Praise Him, He is Triune- the Father, the Son, and the Spirit flows into us . Today, we can enjoy Him as everything in our mingle spirit.( Matt. 28;19,2cor. 13:14, Rev. 1;4~5)</article>
