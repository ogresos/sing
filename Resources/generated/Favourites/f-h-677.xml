My prayer is that I sink into His fulness and in trustful weakness lie, that my humbling failures save me from the strength that harms! And not me alone.....but all who call upon His name.....Amen.</article>

	<article author="Frank Pytel" email="" city="Chicago" provst="Illinois" country="United States" month="2" day="27" year="2010">When things are so bleak, and lonliness accompanies our sorrow, our way and support can only be found in Christ. He comes to us, and remains there when we can't go on. Somehow the touch of His hand or the holding strength of His arm does something to release us within. At times His supporting hand or arm comes in one of His members, who can be with us (1 Cor. 12:26a; Rom. 12:15b). Whether it is His direct touch when we are alone, or the loving touch of a member of His body, it is all Christ.</article>

When I have fallen due to my own failure or for another reason, it is wonderfully comforting to know that underneath me is something much better than any safety net - His everlasting arms. 

I especially like v3:
And we find our humbling failures
Save us from the strength that harms!</article>
	<article author="Jason Lee" email="" city="Anaheim" provst="CA" country="" month="4" day="7" year="2009">"Underneath thy deepest sorrow are the everlasting arms." - What a marvelous comfort for a child of God to discover that at the bottom of sorrow are His everlasting arms! Upon arriving at the end of our reach (underneath thee), we experience the endless of time (everlasting) arms! This hymn manages the element of surprise (trustful weakness, strength that harms) with the strong encouragement of His almighty, far reaching, and everlasting arms. After everything sinks, faints, fails, and (time) runs out, we but sink into His fulness, into His everlasting arms. It reminds me of another Simpson's hymn that we are "sinking into God."</article>

One time I was praying and and the bottom just opened up and all my sorrow just spilled out in tears to the Lord. The Lord really met me and carried me through the night.</article>
