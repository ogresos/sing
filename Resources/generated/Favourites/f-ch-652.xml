1. Wait not, always dreaming to do some great work someday, 
Wait not for light to shine far away,
You now have all sorts of duty to fulfill today,
On your own corner, you should shine.

On your own corner, you should shine!
On your own corner, you should shine!
When the going gets tough, brighter the saints’ light should shine,
On your own corner, you should shine.

2. "Let your light shine before men," this is the Lord’s order,
Him obey, your light do not cover;
Out of darkness into light needed to guide sinner, 
On your own corner, you should shine.

3. Look next to you, there are some believers wandering,
The lost sheep, no need elsewhere searching,
Exhort, restore, comfort, caring for the Lord’s feeling,
On your own corner, you should shine.

4. Fellowship with the Lord, behold His face constantly, 
Reflecting the radiance of glory;
Men will be touched if you love and serve the Lord truly,
On your own corner, you should shine.

5. The Savior as morning star is now near to present,
The Lord comes, His slaves’ reward present;
Save sinners, restore believers, while it is present,
On your own corner, you should shine.</article>
