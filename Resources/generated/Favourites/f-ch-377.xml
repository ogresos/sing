Hymn #377 in the Chinese hymnal is on Christ as life. The first stanza reads, "Glory! Glory! Christ is life to me, / Glory! Glory! The Spirit leads me; / Weakness turns to power, / Darkness turns to light; / Glory! Glory! Christ is life to me." This hymn is very simple, but it is on the central lane of God's economy.
