	<article author="Emmy" email="emilydjobe@gmail.com" city="Houston" provst="TX" country="United States" month="7" day="23" year="2016">This song is spiritual warfare. I learned this some time ago. Sing it when you are facing spiritual oppression-- especially in the form of anxiety or depression-- and the heaviness just lifts. Something about this song really puts agents to flight. Sing it regularly and really internalize the message; make it a sincere, personal pledge.</article>
