He pastored in Cully and Sainte Croix, then went to the Free Church at Vevey, near Montreux on Lake Geneva, where he served for thirty-five years. Along with writing original hymns, Budry also translated hymns from German, English and Latin into French. Some of his works were published in Chants Evangeliques, Lausanne, Switzerland, 1885. - songsandhymns
