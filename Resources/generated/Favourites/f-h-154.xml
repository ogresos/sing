I love it for it brings back my life and hope in the love Jesus shows us all. Indeed, it is beyond all knowledge.</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="7" day="20" year="2014">Mary Shekleton of Dublin, Ireland, was for many years an invalid, during which time she wrote several hymns. Several of these are given in "Chosen, Chastened, Crowned. Memorials of Mary Shekleton, late Secretary of the Invalid's Prayer Union, by her Sister", 1884, and are in common use. -John Julian, Dictionary of Hymnology
------------------------
Stanza 3, last 2 lines originally said:
Which brought an undone sinner, such as me,
Right home to God.
-------------------
The last stanza, 1st 3 lines is humbler in the original:
7. And when my Jesus face to face I see,
When at His lofty throne I bow the knee,
Then of His love, in all its breadth and length,
--------------------
I think stanza 5, 1st 2 lines is not true. It is an exaggeration to say that Christians brought not even 1 thought of love to the Lord. The whole song contains many thoughts of love that she brought to the Lord. She probably meant before we were saved and didn't have room to fit that thought in the stanza.</article>

	<article author="ER" email="" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="10" day="20" year="2011">Precious hymn, sweet, tender, poetic. This was one of the favorites of a dear sister who has not been meeting. One day we where singing it and as she found the hymn in her old hymn book she saw she had all sorts of hearts and stars around it, she realized she had enjoyed it much when she was a teenager. O Lord, "Yet I may come, and come again to Thee, with this the empty sinner's only plea, Thou lovest me." Lord, bring this sister and her husband back.</article>

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="25" year="2008">Some hymns may be in the same category and of the same subject but have a different feeling. Every hymn has its feeling. For example, "It passeth knowledge, that dear love of Thine" (Hymns, #154) is a hymn for remembering the Lord and has the Lord's love as its subject. The feeling of this hymn is fine, sweet, and tender. The feeling of other hymns may not be as fine as this one, even though their subject is the Lord's love. Some hymns have a fine feeling and are also poetic. Other hymns, however, may not be poetic. In learning the hymns, we need to know their categories and subject so that we can further distinguish them according to their feeling.
