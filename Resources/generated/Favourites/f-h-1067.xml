	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="4" day="4" year="2014">Born in Vermont, Mrs. Frank A. (Carrie E.) Breck moved to Portland, Oregon, after her marriage. She was a busy mother of 5 daughters with a strong love for the Lord. Most of her hymns were composed while she did housework. She would jot down whatever came to her as she was mending clothes, holding a baby, or even when she was sweeping the floor or washing dishes. She did not have a musical ear nor could she carry a tune, but she was able to write poetry. She wrote more than 2000 poems. - Songs of the Spirit by Martin
The original chorus says, "They are nailed to the cross!" instead of "They were borne on the cross." The title of this song is "Nailed to the Cross".</article>
