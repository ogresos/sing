    <article author="CF" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="6" day="4" year="2012">I'm so happy to know I can trust myself to the Lord Jesus. When nothing makes sense, when I cannot trust in anything I see or feel, when I can hardly see one step in front of me, I can say "Lord Jesus! I'm entrusting myself to You." My flesh and my heart fail, but God the strength of my heart and my portion forever! Blessed is the man whose trust Jehovah is!</article>
    <article author="PL" email="" city="Dunedin" provst="" country="New Zealand" month="10" day="20" year="2011">Such a sweet hymn, and this melody is beautiful too. I appreciate the words in verse 4: "when head or hand refuses to think or labor more". At these times, we can really lean on our sweet Lord. He is real and practical because He indwells our spirit! (2 Tim. 4:22) Our flesh may be weak, but our spirit is willing (Matt. 26:41).</article>
