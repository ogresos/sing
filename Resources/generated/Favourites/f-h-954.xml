	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="" month="4" day="12" year="2014">Born in England, Henry Burton moved as a child with his family to the U.S. where he was educated at Beloit College. In 1865 he returned to England and joined the Wesleyan Methodists. He traveled as a minister with the leading circuit preachers of the time. - Songs of the Spirit by Martin

This hymn is also sung to the tune "Autumn" by Francois H. Barthelemon, which tune is also often used for "Jesus, I my cross have taken". I prefer that tune because it is simpler for me to sing.</article>

	<article author="Lee" email="" city="Stellenbosch" provst="Western Cape" country="South Africa" month="9" day="13" year="2012">My dad was a Methodist minister. This was one of his favourite hymns which all the ministers sang at his funeral. Will never forget the sound of their voices.</article>
	<article author="Keith Bailey" email="" city="Ottawa" provst="Ontario" country="Canada" month="7" day="18" year="2012">it has been a favourite of mine since my 1940s boyhood in Rushden, Northants. The melody and words match just so joyfully! I have sung it several times as an Advent solo (here in Ottawa). This audio has a slightly different harmony from that in the 1930s' Methodist Hymn Book #256. Does anyone have info on Wostenholm and particularly his magnificent "Defiance" MHB #483 Â© Methodist Conference of 1912?</article>
	<article author="Peter Sincock" email="" city="Redruth" provst="Cornwall" country="United Kingdom" month="6" day="13" year="2012">As a methodist local preacher I was asked by a member of the congregation to preach on this hymn. It was so lovely to re-visit a hymn I hadn't sung for ages and be reminded of the great hope of the Christian faith that God is in control and that Jesus will return and establish His Kingdom of peace and joy forever.</article>
	<article author="Gertrude Warren" email="" city="Mississauga" provst="Ontario" country="Canada" month="5" day="6" year="2012">I feel the presence of the Lord with me. My son asked me to sing it for him after hearing me singing it all the time. But I could not find it in my hymnal. So I asked my friend to find it for me. My son is blessed with this hymn.</article>
	<article author="Marika" email="" city="Johannesburg" provst="" country="South Africa" month="4" day="21" year="2012">Is there any hymn more beautiful? I love it... The way it builds up to that fantastic climax - our church voices straining with the thrill and joy of it!</article>
	<article author="Andy" email="" city="Welingborough" provst="Northants" country="United Kingdom" month="1" day="10" year="2011">This was my dad's favourite hymn and speaks to me of his pilgrim heart and my childhood--always inspired by his faith.</article>
	<article author="Julia Moore" email="" city="Portslade" provst="East Sussex" country="United Kingdom" month="1" day="29" year="2010">Even though I've been a committed CHRISTian for over 30 years, I haven't heard of Henry Burton before. I love the words of this hymn and I will commit them to memory and possibly use them in the CHRISTian Round Robin to which I belong. Thank you.</article>
