The problem with so much "discipleship" these days is we are trying to prop up old Adam and make him look alive when he is actually still dead in trespasses and sins! When a man is truly born of God (Jn.1:13) he becomes a new creature in Christ (2Cor.5:17), old things pass away, and behold all things are become new! (the world has lost its charm). Intimate fellowship and communion once lost in Adam are restored in Christ Jesus, purchased by His own blood. It's good to be set free from the chains of sin and death, to see the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, to be alive from the dead, to have peace with God and the peace of God, to love Him with the love He put in me by the new birth! Hallelujah!!!</article>

And, so we see the lyricist of this lovely, melodious hymn include this verse in the chorus. 

Separation from the world must be taught from the get go as soon as person is born again, or he or she may fall into the worldly trappings that has ensnared many of the young people today, that is, they find themselves settled in the world again right after coming to the Lord Jesus. 

And, it is not their fault for not going forward into the divine things that pertain to Godliness, but it may be our fault. 
 
Are we spending time teaching these new ones, or are we absorbed by other things, than in taking time to teach these new ones who are in great need to be taught?

Or will we remain silent and let them all have it their own way. And, by letting them have it their own way, instead of the Bible way, we give them up to be taken into the strong tide of the end time apostasy, that is, the falling away from the words of God.

Now, the words of the Apostle John in that he said, "Love not the World" is falling on deaf ears, as the youth of today that have confessed Christ are drawn away to play hours of hours of video games, and to watch hours of football, and other sports, and entertainments on television.

If they do not pick up the plow to labour in the Harvest of the Lord now, who will be saved tomorrow? How many will go unsaved, because many of the present generation and past generation are slothful in the work of the Lord, which work is to disciple all the nations. 

I never thought I see the day that genuine born again believers refuse to take heed to the Apostle's teaching of not loving the world. As if loving the world take preeminence and has some actual worth, rather than loving our dear Lord Jesus Christ Who gave His own blood to wash us from our sins. He has loved us, and has made us kings and priests unto God and His Father. And, in view of this, many prefer to love the world, and the things of the world?</article>
