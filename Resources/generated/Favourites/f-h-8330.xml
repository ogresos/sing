    <article author="Teresa" email="" city="" provst="" country="New Zealand" month="1" day="9" year="2014">The Lord desires our absolute consecration to Him. I really enjoyed reading the excerpt of our brother's experience which led him to write this hymn (via hymns.net).

"As believers, we may seemingly commit much to the Lord, yet it is often the case that our deepest emotions, our tenderest, most cherished desires and feelings remain hidden from Him. We may pray to the Lord concerning many things, yet guard from Him the most secret chambers of our heart. Yet the Lord desires our full and complete consecration that He might make His home in each believer's heart (Eph. 3:17). He desires to fill and occupy our inward parts, that He might genuinely be our all in all (Col. 3:11). In this way, Christ gradually grows and increases within us until we are fully conformed to His glorious image (Rom. 8:29)."

This matter of consecration isn't one we commit to the Lord once in our lives; it is a yearly, monthly, daily, moment-by-moment matter. Things in our lives change and things that we once thought were not hindrances between us and the Lord can creep in at any moment. May we open up to the Lord concerning all aspects of our lives that He would be our single most desire!</article>

Guide me through every stage; 
Stand by and strengthen me to go 
Through this dark, evil age. 

Hallelujah we have such a marvalous Shepherd that guides us through every stage! Thank You Lord for Shepherding us out of so many things, and Lord continue to Shepherd us Until we could declare "Whom have I in heaven but thee? And there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee."</article>

As I go stage after stage in my Christian life, I confess that my soul--my mind, emotion and my will are occupied by a lot other than Christ. I pray that He make His home in my heart, replace everything that is not Him so Christ is my all and in all.
I am also touched about our dear brother Watchman Nee's testimony regarding this hymn:

Praise the Lord, what a pattern to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity [1 Timothy 4:12]</article>
