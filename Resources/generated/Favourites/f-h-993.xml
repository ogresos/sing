	<article author="Elizabeth (Lizzy)" email="aesst@icloud.com" city="Markham" provst="Ontario" country="Canada" month="3" day="31" year="2016">One of my favorite hymns. Sang with young people and children and they loved it too.
Christ’s ministry on earth : to save the sinful, heal the sick and lame; cheer the mourner, still the tempest, friend of sinners, seek the lost ones……
Hebrews 13:8
Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today, yes, even forever
RcV bible footnote: For a true and steadfast church life, we must hold on to the Christ who is the same yesterday, and today and even forever and must not be carried away by various strange teachings. Various and strange teachings are always used by the enemy to cause dissension and even division in the church.</article>
