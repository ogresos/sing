	<article author="Candace S" email="" city="" provst="Tennessee" country="United States" month="3" day="21" year="2016">I'm so thankful for the hymns inspired by God. A dear woman sang this at a previous church my husband pastored. There have been times when I have been completely overwhelmed with trials and heartaches, and even if you have a loving family, sometimes there is absolutely no one on earth who can understand us like our Lord. He's the One who knows our thoughts even before we think them and our words while they are still on our tongue, and what a comfort to know He is a friend who is closer than a brother. When it seems dark, Christ is my light...I must tell Jesus!!</article>

I'm so very thankful to have had parents who passed the face to me and my siblings. They took us to church and in church I learned hymns and I so miss them in the modern day church today. Though the music is good, there is just something about these old hymns. I hope and pray that I will never forget them, and that I can pass them down to my children.</article>
	<article author="Claudia Aeby" email="haaeb1@msn.com" city="Cornville" provst="Arizona" country="United States" month="7" day="10" year="2015">When in prayer or Bible study songs come into my mind and heart. When I was young our church sang many hymns and the Lord brings them to my mind. Today it was this song. I am 74 now so sometimes don't remember more than a line. Thankfully we can look them up on line even if it is just a phrase. I have Trigeminal Neuralgia a painful condition and the Lord brought this to me "I cannot bear my burdens alone - I must tell Jesus"</article>

	<article author="Frank Adkins" email="fladkins139@embarqmail.com" city="Ocala" provst="Florida" country="United States" month="2" day="17" year="2015">I have caught myself many times over the years when I might be experiencing stressful times or just feel like singing out loud at home or in the car. I would start singing the Hymn; “I Must Tell Jesus.” I often remember my mother, singing this hymn and many others as we (my Dad, Mom, brother and sister) worked together hoeing crops that were planted months before on our farm among the hills of West Virginia. For Mom, her singing may also be while milking the cows, or working in the kitchen preparing meals, or wherever. She wasn’t the most beautiful alto singer in the world, but she made her voice be heard within hearing range of her family, or whenever someone else who might venture into the range of her melodious renditions. Even with my mother’s passing years ago, I can still hear her singing. Even today as we gather for worship in church and hear the piano, the organ, other instruments, the choir and the congregation sing in unison the praises of our Lord, we realize how blessed we are to participate in vocalizing these words of praise to God. We also recognize how blessed we are that God has gifted many people with special gifts of music presentation, and Hymn writing. Once in a while a song leader may describe an event, or trouble, or tragedy which occurred that motivated the Hymn writer the scribe the delicate words that expressed praise of God even in difficult times. These gifted people are often led in sharing other songs that uplift us as we sing. I happened to be singing “I Must Tell Jesus” in my home the other day, and I begin to wonder what event or tragedy happened that motivated the Hymn writer to pen this beautiful Hymn. I found that the author of this Hymn (as well as 2000 more) was Eli­sha A. Hoff­man . Please visit sites hat explain how he came about writing that Hymn and other interesting information about himself. I hope you can take the time to peruse through the information.......God Bless and have a Great Day.</article>

	<article author="Tammy" email="mnt10rose@aol.com" city="Glendale" provst="CA" country="United States" month="10" day="17" year="2014">I knew my friend was putting a distance between us, but I didn't know why.  I am homeless at the time and have several health issues. She kindly offered me a room to stay in, so for my appreciation I have done all I can to be a blessing to her.  What had I done?  So, I inquired.  Well, she told me.  She could not handle my complaining and crying.  Of course I was hurt, but come to realize quickly, I was telling the wrong person my fears, my aches, my pains.  I must tell Jesus, I must tell Jesus, Jesus can help me, Jesus alone.</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="Mi" country="United States" month="12" day="8" year="2013">One day a pastor visited a troubled member. She faced many afflictions and was greatly discouraged. When the sister had unburdened herself to her pastor, she pleaded, "Brother Hoffman, what shall I do? What shall I do?" The pastor didn't really know what to say to her. To buy himself a few moments, he read some Scripture. Then he gave her the practical advice he could offer. "You cannot do better than to take all of your sorrows to Jesus," he said. "You must tell Jesus." Surprisingly, this off-the-cuff pastoral advice worked! The woman thought about it. She became focused on meditation. Then her countenance changed. And with great joy, she agreed with her pastor, "Yes, I must tell Jesus."
The pastor, Elisha A. Hoffman, soon returned to his study. But he couldn't get that sister's face out of his mind. Her words continued to ring in his ear. "I must tell Jesus. I must tell Jesus. I must tell Jesus." By the time Hoffman reached his study, he had crafted the words to this beloved hymn. - It Happens After Prayer by H. B. Charles, Jr.
