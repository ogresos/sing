You know why? - few of them recently "discovered" this beautiful hymn for me! I went much into the depths of it by researching the Bible to support every sentence with verses. This is wonderful experience of studying the hymns and a real exercise I enjoy! Oh, after doing this the hymn becomes so sweet and personal and the riches really flow from every word! This particular hymn caught me with its brightness, lightness and so beautiful a tune. Oh, He is working on us by shining, breathing, speaking and living in us so that all of His Person and possessions as the Life-giving Spirit could be wrought into us for our faithful service to hasten His return. Lord, grant us full days of the growth in life and may each day count in your economy!</article>
