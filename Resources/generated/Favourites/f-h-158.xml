    <article author="Hymnal.Net" month="3" day="25" year="2008">This hymn can easily touch the feeling deep within us. On the one hand, it gives us a sense of the Lord's coming to seek us and His giving Himself up for us; on the other hand, it stirs up a sense of gratitude in our hearts and a desire to offer up our praise to the Lord.
