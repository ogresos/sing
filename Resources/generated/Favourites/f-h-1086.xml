	<article author="Max Pankau" email="" city="Chicago" provst="IL" country="United States" month="9" day="8" year="2011">Sister Deb, the chorus you posted (to my understanding) was originally written as a different hymn and the two were fused together at some point. I grew up singing the song this way myself in Texas. The only publication I ever saw the two printed together in was the old YP songbook, the "gray book". Since the gray book is no longer used, I have noticed that saints tend to drop the chorus when singing this hymn.</article>
	<article author="Deb Gallardo" email="" city="Fredericktown" provst="Ohio" country="United States" month="6" day="22" year="2011">There is a little chorus that I learned at an East Coast gathering of the churches in Maryland for a camp about 10 years ago, (including NY, NJ, MD, VA &amp; NC) that some of the saints sang with this song like a refrain. I've been trying to find the music for it unsuccessfully. Here are the words:

Touching Jesus is all that really matters.
And your life will never be the same.
There's only one way that you can really touch Him.
Just believe when you call on His name.

This chorus is inserted between the two verses and dovetails perfectly with it.

Can anyone help me out with this?</article>

This was written by Isaac Watts during time of John and Charles Wesley. He wrote this in relation to Psalm 72:19 "And blessed be His glorious name forever; And may His glory fill the whole earth. Amen and Amen."</article>
