He published many practical and devotional works which attained a wide circulation. Born in Bonhard, Scone, Perthshire, Macduff was educated at the University of Edinburgh, and was ordained as minister of Kettins, a parish in Forfarshire in 1843. He returned to St Madoes, a parish in Perthshire in 1849, which he left to take charge of Sandyford, a new church in Glasgow. He preached there for fifteen years (until 1870), and then went to live in Chislehurst, Kent, in order to focus entirely on writing. He received the degree of D.D. from the University of Glasgow in 1862, and about the same time also from the University of New York. His best known books were: "The Prophet of Fire"; "Memories of Bethany": "Memories of Gennesaret"; "The Shepherd and His Flock ": "Sunset on the Hebrew Mountains "; "Comfort Ye"; "The Golden Gospel"; "Morning and Night Watches"; "The Bow in the Cloud"; "The Story of a Dewdrop"; and "The Story of a Shell." In 1857 he was appointed by the General Assembly a member of their Hymnal Committee. His 31 hymns appeared in his Altar Stones, 1853, and were also included with his later poems in his The Gates of Praise, 1876. Wikipedia and Dictionary of Hymnology by Julian

This hymn is more often sung to the tune of #602 "O how glorious! O how holy", "Unser Herrscher" by Joachim Neander, which I think is a better match. 
--------------------------
There is an additional stanza, which is usually omitted, following stanza 2 above:
2a Though once cradled in a manger,
 Oft no pillow but the sod;
 Here an alien and a stranger,
 Mocked of men, disowned of God.
 Christ is coming! Christ is coming!
 Come, Thou blessèd Prince of Peace!
-----------------------
Stanza 3 above is a bit different in the original:
Long Thine exiles have been pining,
 Far from rest, and home, and Thee;
 But, in heav’nly vestures shining,
 They their loving Lord shall see;
 Christ is coming! Christ is coming!
 Haste the joyous jubilee.

Last stanza, 4th line, should end in a colon rather than a period and originally says:
Onward roll from tongue to tongue:</article>

I recently discover this site in my computer, all along I was looking for something like this. I love this song because it is spiritually. Any hymn that I sang I always love it. I have nothing to do for the Lord, than to sing praises to him.</article>
