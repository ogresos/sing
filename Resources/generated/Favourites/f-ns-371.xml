    <article author="Faith Tan" email="" city="Zamboanga City" provst="" country="Philippines" month="3" day="26" year="2012">The Lord loves us unreasonably, thus, how we need to love Him as well. However, the love that we should render should not come from our naturalness but from the love that comes from Him. Only the things that comes from Him can satisfy Him; ourselves has no ground on it. May we be more open to be filled with His divine love so that whenever we say, "Lord Jesus, we love You," we surely can satisfy our Beloved.</article>
