	<article author="Sis LC" email="" city="Auckland" provst="" country="New Zealand" month="5" day="4" year="2011">Rev 22:1 says “and he showed me…” He showed me!
 
When I sang this today, the word “showed” stood out to me. In revelations 21, one of the seven angels said to John, “Come here; I will show you the bride, the wife of the lamb”, and he showed John the holy city, then revelations 22 goes on to say “and he showed me a river of water of life…” Aren’t we blessed we have ones showing us things! The entire bible is showing us, revealing to us, making visible to us what we cannot otherwise see.
 
We are so blessed to have a God who is showing us what’s on His heart. It’s cherishing to have someone show us things. Just like it’s cherishing for a parent to teach their kids new things. We often take it for granted. I don’t want to take my God for granted! We have a God who is pouring out Himself to us. He has revealed His heart to us and even wrote it all in a book! Lord, empty us so that we can receive all that You are showing us today. Turn our hearts to You, so that when you’re showing us something, we won’t walk away! We won’t shut our ears to Your speaking! Lord, keep us open to You, so that we're ready to receive what You've been wanting to show us!</article>

It is not common in hymns, perhaps because people will misunderstand it. Where can I get this CD, "Lord Your Return"?</article>

Our Precious Lord give us to drink!</article>
