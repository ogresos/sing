    <article author="Steve" city="Hamilton" provst="Waikato" country="New Zealand" month="10" day="8" year="2012">It simply says Thank You Lord. Words cannot express how thankful I am but this song helps me articulate thanks to God. Saying thank You Lord is the best tonic. The song exalts the Lord, and that helps me take my eyes off myself and onto Him.</article>
