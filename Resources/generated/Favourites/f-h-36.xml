	<article author="Steven Miller" email="smille10@sbcglobal.net" city="Livonia" provst="Michigan" country="United States" month="5" day="28" year="2016">Henry Smart, the composer of this tune, was a musician and organist in Blackburn, Lancashire. He wanted to write a tune for Reginald Heber's beautiful Missionary Hymn, "From Greenland's Icy Mountains". He said, "I shall call it Lancashire." We rarely use that tune for that hymn any more, but the tune Lancashire lives on. The hymn "Lead On, O King Eternal" was written specifically to be sung to the tune Lancashire.
Henry Smart was blind for the last 15 years of his life. During those years he served as organist in St. Pancras Church, London. - Hymn Stories by Wilbur Konkel</article>
	<article author="Z.F." email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="20" year="2016">We praise Thee, glorious Father,
 As objects of Thy grace,
Who for Thine own heartâ€™s pleasure
 Are now before Thy face:
Thy sons marked out for glory
 Known from eternity
With Christ Thy Well-beloved,
 Object supreme to Thee.
I like verse 1 so much! It is very true! And hearing this at my junior high conferences and SSOT (summer school of truth), I can see Thy marked ones are destined for this!!! ðŸ˜„</article>
