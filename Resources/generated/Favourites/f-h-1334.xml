May the joy of the Lord remain in your mingled spirit each moment of your life unto eternity. Just want to share with you that one of the most favorite sung hymns, Blessed Assurance, Jesus is Mine; the writer Fanny Crosby, had your experience, too. She wrote this hymn, after she received the comfort from the Lord Spirit. May we Love our Lord Jesus more and more each day. The Lord loves us beyond our knowledge. Love you in Christ. Amen.</article>

His father wrote it. When he was a young man living at home his mother passed away. The household was in sad and in mourning. Heaviness and grief. And one night he awoke in the middle of the night with his father playing the piano accordion to this tune "..thou hast turned my mourning into dancing for me....." and singing this joyful song to the Lord. 
Always has been one of my favorites. It is very powerful.</article>

I woke up with this song. And you made me even happier, by playing it on the piano, I love the piano.</article>
	<article author="Alina" email="alinamichalski@hotmail.com" city="" provst="" country="Poland" month="10" day="5" year="2013">After reading your comments, I was convicted in my spirit. I lost a beloved bird a week ago and I looked for her and cried all the nights and days and I was unable to accept any comfort. Even now it is still the case. However, you Yichien lost a BABY! I am so sorry. I am so sorry. I did not know the hymn, but picked it wishing it was true in my case. I pray it will be soon.</article>

	<article author="Yichien" email="sufamily@att.net" city="Madison" provst="NJ" country="United States" month="12" day="5" year="2012">After losing our baby at 16 months, I was in mouring for longer than I care to remember until one day, I lifted up my eyes and looked onto the heavens to seek my God. He strengthened me and beared my grief. Praise You, Lord! You have turned my mourning into dancing by giving me Your very self. Praise You that I have a spirit not confined to my human circumstances!</article>
