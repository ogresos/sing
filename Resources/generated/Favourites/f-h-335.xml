He and his wife, Blanch Kerr, were involved in evangelism and song writing. He, together with his wife, wrote more than 500 gospel songs. He especially enjoyed leading congregational singing where his vibrancy was contagious. His last days were spent at Youth Haven Ranch, a mission for underprivileged children at Rives Junction, Michigan. - Songs of the Spirit by Martin</article>
