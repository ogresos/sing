Not sure it is the best thing to use secular melody for Christian songs. The verses are priceless, but they deserve a better melody, especially if it comes from the heart as it's title.</article>

	<article author="Edward Godman Chang" email="edwrdchang@gmail.com" city="San Diego" provst="CA" country="United States" month="9" day="4" year="2013">Amen, saints. This hymn is a precious gem of an experience of consecration - giving one's own life - to the Lord. How can we do this? "Enjoyment so full! Life's reality! That's what you are to me; Lord, You have won my heart!" We did nothing - our God won our hearts and now we can't help but give ourselves to Him.

One suggestion for the sake of clarity is to change "Lord, I can't help giving myself to You" to "Lord, I can't help but give myself to You" and similarly on other lines. This will help give a clear translation and also help convey the feeling of a present desire for consecration.</article>

'From my heart, comes a melody, From the one who gave his life for me...' Aren't those words so sweet? I gave myself to the Lord when I was a little girl. I am now so thankful I did! I'm also so thankful God sent his only son to take away our sins!</article>

My dearest, precious Lord will continue our journey through eternity. Many things are unknown in my life right now but Him being with me, I am totally content and happy. My Lord and Savior, I love You!!!</article>

	<article author="Igor" email="igor.savinkin@gmail.com" city="Kaliningrad" provst="" country="Russia" month="1" day="12" year="2013">"Lord, I can't help giving myself to Thee." May His love constrain us till the day we see Him in His parousia. Lord, bless us supremely to love You all the days of our lives. Come, Lord Jesus.</article>
	<article author="Ernjay Kim" email="" city="Iligan" provst="" country="Philippines" month="1" day="19" year="2011">When I first heard this song through a brother the only thing that remained on me at that time was these words "falling in love with You." We have the experience deep within that the Lord is so lovable. We are like Rebecca who fall in love with Isaac though she only saw the slave and did not see him personally for the first time. We cannot see the Lord yet we fall in love with Him because His love constrains us to love Him. Because of this we cannot help but to give our whole heart to love Him.</article>
