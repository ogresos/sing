    <article author="David" city="" provst="" country="Singapore" month="9" day="28" year="2009">Thank the Lord that today is always a new beginning! May we just give every day to Him! Let us be those who come to seek Him everyday, quietly listening to Him and waiting in His presence, so that He will cause us to be filled in spirit to constantly contact Him, living by Him and living Him out. And how we need the Lord to shine upon us and into the depths of our being, and purge away all the darkness and filth of sin, that we would be free from all burdens and fetters, that we may always rejoice in choosing His ways.</article>

That's why He is ever fresh ever new each day. So friends, brothers and sisters, just come to Him moment by moment to the THRONE OF GRACE, take Hime, enjoy Him. Forget our past, our failures, ourselves. Start anew! Hallelujah to the ONE who fills all in all.</article>
