-----------------
Mr. Cornelius was brought up on a farm in my own coun­ty in Penn­syl­van­ia. He left farm­ing when he came of age, and learned the trade of a brick-ma­son. Lat­er he be­came a con­tract­or in Pitts­burg. In erect­ing a house in that ci­ty his leg was brok­en. The phy­si­cians de­cid­ed that it would have to be am­pu­tat­ed…He stood the op­er­a­tion well and came out safe­ly, but was maimed for life. He now de­cid­ed to go to col­lege and get an ed­u­ca­tion. Af­ter pass­ing through col­lege with hon­or he con­clud­ed to be­come a min­is­ter of the gos­pel. His first charge was at Al­too­na, Penn­syl­van­ia, but on ac­count of his wife’s health he soon re­moved to Cal­i­for­nia, lo­cat­ing at Pa­sa­de­na, where he built the larg­est Pres­by­ter­i­an church in that place.
Ma­ny who had sub­scribed to help to pay for the building failed in bu­si­ness, and he was left to meet the ob­li­ga­tions as best he could. But in a few years he had the church cleared from all debt. Short­ly af­ter­ward his wife died. He preached the fun­er­al ser­mon him­self. At the con­clu­sion he quot­ed the words of this hymn, which he had com­posed short­ly before. Both the words of the hymn and the ser­mon were print­ed in a West­ern news­pa­per, where Ma­jor Whit­tle found them. Im­pressed by their beau­ty, he cut them out and car­ried them in his Bi­ble for three months be­fore he wrote the chor­us…Soon af­ter he hand­ed the words to his friend, James Mc­Gran­a­han, who com­posed the tune to which the hymn is now sung. - Sankey's Story of the Gospel Hymns</article>

The words and music are comforting and remind me always that God will never let us down . Jesus knew what it was to feel sadness, loneliness and despair, face pain and rejection and knowing that, we can come to Him, knowing He will understand exactly how we feel. Thank you.</article>

I don't understand at all the meaning of "suffering" for the vision the Lord gave, but i'll just go through it, Lord. Trusting You in all my days, sing and praise though darkness. So someday I'll understand, not now I think, but someday I must know. Thank You Lord for this hymn.</article>

He would sit at the piano or organ and sing hymns and this was one he would often sing. He served the Lord in Alaska with my dear mother for 35 years enduring poverty, loneliness and physical trials so that he could make his Master known among many who seriously needed Christ. Now He has claimed His rest by God's grace.</article>
