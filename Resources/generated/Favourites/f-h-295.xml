O, Lord, amen, hallelujah!
 "Midst flaming worlds, in this arrayed,
With joy shall I lift up my head."!!!!!
And I also enjoy the verse the way it's been translated into my language (Russian): 
"Среди пылающих миров 
Ликую я Ты мой покров."!!!!!!!!</article>

	<article author="T. Diyan" email="" city="London" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="2" day="12" year="2012">I love and appreciate the Lord for His covering as our righteousness. Thank You Jesus Christ our robe of righteousness. May You gain Your heart's desire.</article>
	<article author="Mike" email="" city="" provst="CA" country="United States" month="2" day="2" year="2012">When a sinner believes, two basic but profound things happen, he is made righteous and is justified before God, hallelujah! And this new life union begins to develop. Lets Go, and tell the world.</article>
	<article author="Leslie" email="" city="Spokane" provst="WA" country="United States" month="7" day="21" year="2011">The words to this song are so profound. Count Zinzendorf was surely a minister of the New Covenant in the Lord's move on the earth. Every time I sing this hymn, my heart wells up with love and appreciation for Christ. Praise the Lord!

(Just a note in response to the last entry... William Gardiner published this melody for the hymn "As a Shepherd Gently Leads Us." He identified Ludwig van Beethoven as the Composer, and himself as the Arranger.)</article>
	<article author="Victoria Byrne" email="" city="London" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="3" day="18" year="2010">I think this tune is actually called 'Germany' and is by William Gardiner. It would be useful if you would put the name of the tune on your website. Thank you for your site, the recordings are the best I've found among comparable sites.</article>
	<article author="Rachelle Carver" email="" city="Albuquerque" provst="NM" country="United States" month="1" day="12" year="2009">I like this song because I am so lost without the Lord as my covering that I have no way to fight any battle. He covers me as my Righteousness and I don't have to try to be what I cannot be. My innermost part is made to receive Him. I hope in the victory already won and look forward to the full manifestation of this FACT.</article>
	<article author="Filip S. Syrek" email="" city="Reading" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="9" day="30" year="2002">Oh, this hymn is just a wonderful reminder that there is no righteousness in me, that I fall short of the highest requirements of God's holy standards - but, praise the Lord! Christ has become my very Righteousness! He is the spotless robe that makes me righteouss in Him!</article>
	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="4" day="21" year="2010">When the Apostle Paul was in the Jewish religion, he surpassed many of his equals (Gal. 1:14). However, he did not at that time obtain God's righteousness. In Philippians 3:9 he spoke a deep and excellent word: "And be found in Him, not having my own righteousness which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God based on faith." Paul did not want to be found in himself, having his own righteousness; he wanted to be found in Christ, having the righteousness which is of God. We, like Paul, need to be found in Christ. That He is our righteousness is expressed by the words of a well-known hymn: "God's Christ, who is my righteousness, My beauty is, my glorious dress." Christ, as God's righteousness, is our covering under whom we stand. God has put us into Christ and made Him our righteousness (1 Cor. 1:30). We stand under His covering. We are one with Him. He, Himself, His very person, not one of His attributes, is our righteousness.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="31" year="2008">There are two aspects of Christ being righteousness from God to the believers. The first aspect is that He is the believers' righteousness for them to be justified before God objectively at the time of their repenting unto God and believing into Christ (Rom. 3:24-26; Acts 13:39; Gal. 3:24b, 27). The first stanza of Hymns, #295 says, "God's Christ, who is my righteousness,/My beauty is, my glorious dress." Christ is our beauty given by God to us to be put on us as our clothing, our glorious dress. This is outward, objective.

The second aspect is that Christ is the believers' righteousness lived out of them as the manifestation of God, who is the righteousness in Christ given to the believers for them to be justified by God subjectively (Rom. 4:25; 1 Pet. 2:24a; James 2:24; Matt. 5:20; Rev. 19:8). We were sinners who repented to God and believed into the Lord Jesus. Right away God gave Christ to us as a glorious dress to cover us, so we are acceptable to God righteously, outwardly. This is objective righteousness. Also, when Christ was given to us to be put on us, He entered into us to be our life and life supply to live Himself out of us. This living out is the manifestation of God in Christ. This is pleasant in the eyes of God. Surely, God would justify us subjectively, not just objectively. Now we can see the two aspects—outward and inward. Christ is put on us, and Christ enters into us to live God out of us to be our subjective righteousness.
