All Scripture is God's breath, God's speaking is His breathing. Whenever God speaks, His breath conveys His element into the ones who receive His word. God is light, life, wisdom, strength to man. As we breathe His word we imparts them in our being. Receiving it by spirits exercised our need is met and His wealth we may employ. Hallelujah!</article>
