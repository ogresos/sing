	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="12" day="14" year="2014">This song is a paraphrase of Psalm 90 by Moses. It seems Moses wrote it when he was ready to depart this world. 
Orthodox Jewish publications also use Watt's hymn [i.e. "Pentateuch &amp; Haftorahs" pub. by Socino Press].
---------
Except for 12 psalms which he felt were unsuited for Christian usage, Watts paraphrased in song the entire book of Psalms in "The Psalms of David Imitated in the Language of the New Testament" published in 1719.
This hymn was sung at Winston Churchill's funeral.
It is the University Anthem of the University of California, Berkeley and of many other colleges. Stanza 5 above is quoted in many secular books. - Wikipedia
---------------
The 1st and last stanzas, 1st line, originally says "Our God". John Wesley changed it to "O God" in his hymnal "Psalms and Hymns" in 1738. Both versions are in current usage. - Wikipedia
------------
Last stanza, 3rd line originally says:
Be Thou our guard while troubles last,
(The alternate "while life shall last" was in the Lutheran hymnal in 1814. -hymnary.org)
-------------------
There are additional stanzas that are usually omitted:
3b Thy Word commands our flesh to dust,
“Return, ye sons of men:”
All nations rose from earth at first,
 And turn to earth again.
---------
4b The busy tribes of flesh and blood,
With all their lives and cares,
Are carried downwards by the flood,
And lost in following years
--------------
5b Like flowery fields the nations stand
Pleased with the morning light;
The flowers beneath the mower’s hand
Lie withering ere ‘tis night.</article>

	<article author="Monica Bailley" email="monica.bailley@gmail.com" city="Mclean" provst="VA" country="United States" month="1" day="25" year="2014">Franklin D. Roosevelt choose this hymn to be sung at the church service the morning of his first inauguration as the 32nd President of the United States. He knew he would need God's help as he undertook the enormous task of leading this country. In fact, he would eventually face the most terrible of wars during his time as President. This great hymn expresses so much about our dear Savior and Lord. Indeed, "Under the shadow of Thy throne Thy saint have dwelt secure!"</article>

Someone has said life is not lost by dying. Life is lost minute by minute, day by dragging day, in all the thousand uncaring way. May the good Lord give us all an understanding of the invaluable potentials of that singular gift He has given to to all earth comers in equal amount irrespective of their family, pedigree or the color of their skin.</article>

	<article author="Vicki Joy" email="vickijoy2001@yahoo.com" city="North Wales" provst="PA" country="United States" month="7" day="10" year="2013">God is all we have. God is all we need. I recently lost my mom to cancer. We were best friends for four decades and spoke for hours every day. We have both walked with the Lord our entire lives and have minds and hearts full of the Word. The last month of her life, I spent 18 hours a day at her bedside, but barely said a word to her. She had many, many Christian visitors, but very few people said anything. She died surrounded by Godly people who loved her, but in human terms, she died alone. In the end, God is all we have. We must use every day - every moment of our loneliness to cultivate feeling and desiring and loving His presence because God is all we have. God is all we need. To Him be glory.</article>
