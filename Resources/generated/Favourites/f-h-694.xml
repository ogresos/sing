My dear brother is divorcing me after 30 yrs. How to go on, how to shepherd the children, how to see him in the meetings, I know not. My spirit grieves and I do not understand. But I praise God that He will take care of me even when assailed with these dangers fierce in my path, no matter what the test, no matter my failing heart. He gives peace. Lord Jesus I lean on Your breast and abide beneath the wings of Your love tonight. God will take care of me. God will take care of me. Lord Jesus, I trust in our Father to take care of me and my children. Lord Jesus I love You even now. Lord make me an overcomer thru letting the Triune God take care of my body, soul and spirit. I surrender to Your care, I trust in Your care. I hold on to nothing on this earth. Gain the increase of Yourself in me for the Body. What a waste if I don't gain You in this unbearable suffering.</article>

	<article author="Kara" email="karat23_10@yahoo.com" city="" provst="" country="" month="8" day="19" year="2015">This song has always encouraged me. While it doesn't mean God will keep us from hard situations, He proves Himself faithful in keeping us while in hard situations. And even those hard experiences draw us close to Him, refining our characters and preparing us for Eternity. All things truly do work together for us for good. And there is no tragedy death or sickness that can seperate us from His love. Be encouraged for soon like Stephen we'll see the Son of Man on the right hand of God and spend with Him all of eternity!</article>

	<article author="Cathy Alston" email="calston1125@yahoo.com" city="Bronx" provst="New York" country="United States" month="7" day="3" year="2015">I was at my lowest point in my life, wishing my life would end. No one to talk to and not hearing a word from God. I was all cried out and had no more voice to pray, and then this song came to me out of nowhere. It was a song that was sung in church when I was a little girl. I had not heard it for over 60 years and it is not a song we now sing in church, yet there it was in my head as clear as clear could be. God gave me this song to comfort me. It was His way of speaking to me. It touches every aspect of my life. Now when I am feeling down or wondering if God hears my prayers. I play this song on my phone and it gives me blessed assurances that Jesus is mine. AMEN... AMEN... AND AMEN</article>

So many years and cultural aspects separate me from its author, and still I'm sure it ministered to her as it now does to me... by the action of the Holy Spirit. As I've been raised in an Italian Evangelical family, I mostly remember and sing it in Italian: "Dimenticar giammai potr√≤ Signor la Tua merc√®".. and as I sing it, I'm also transported in time, back when my grandma' used to sing it while cooking or sitting at church... Thanks God for these wonderful songs!</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="1" day="26" year="2013">W. Stillman Martin had been invited to preach at a church a few hours away from his home. But his wife became ill that Sunday morning, and he was about to cancel his speaking engagement. Then his young son spoke up, "Father, don't you think that if God wants you to preach today, He will take care of Mother while you are away?" Martin made the trip, and when he returned home later that day he found that his wife had written this hymn in his absence. That evening, he composed the music.

God will take of us, all we have to do is ask and let Him in our heart.</article>
