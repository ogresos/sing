	<article author="A. W. H." email="awhoekstra@aol.com" city="Coconut Creek" provst="Florida" country="United States" month="2" day="9" year="2013">it is interesting to sing any song, for generally, all we do is repeat the words - the sounds - and every now and then there is a glimmer of insight into the meaning. for this song, if we really understood that God's plan and heart's desire for mankind is to make man one with Him in Life and Nature, and to be one with Him in man's spirit, and to be one with man now and in the future, we would be converted from word readers to "true believers" - ones proclaiming great praise. this song does that. now, we must turn to the Lord, call on Him, touching Him in our spirit, where the Life-Giving Spirit dwells, and then we could shout this song to others, knowing the truth of the words. I recommend the one signing this song simply read the words every now and then, not just sing them. read them to the paper you are looking at. then read them to the room you are in. then read them and proclaim them to the God of this universe. not once. but several times. and in doing so, you will pass from the old man, old nature, curse of the flesh, and you will touch the Life-Giving Spirit, in your spirit. Amen!</article>
	<article author="Dennis Sumaru" email="" city="Melbourne" provst="Victoria" country="Australia" month="10" day="26" year="2012">This was my favourite hymn when I attended Dudley high school in Fiji in 1966. I suddenly remembered this hymn and I googled and I found it. I have saved it so that I can listen to it, when I feel lonely.
Thank you and God bless you for posting this online.</article>
