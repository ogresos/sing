	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="Michigan" country="United States" month="12" day="16" year="2015">"It was written as a Christian good-bye, and first sung in the First Congregational Church, of which I was minister for fifteen years. We had Gospel meetings on Sunday nights, and our music was intentionally of the popular kind. I wrote the first stanza, and sent it to two gentlemen for music. The music which seemed to me to best suit the words was written by T. G. Tomer, teacher of public schools in New Jersey, at one time on the staff of General 0. 0. Howard. After receiving the music (which was revised by Dr. J. W. Bischoff, the organist of my church), I wrote the other stanzas." - Jeremiah Eames Rankin in 'Dictionary of Hymnology' by Julian.

Stanza 4 above was printed on postcards to soldiers.

There are 4 additional stanzas which are usually omitted:
2b. God be with you till we meet again;
With the oil of joy anoint you;
Sacred ministries appoint you;
God be with you till we meet again.
------------
3b. God be with you till we meet again;
Of His promises remind you;
For life’s upper garner bind you;
God be with you till we meet again.
-------------
3c. God be with you till we meet again;
Sicknesses and sorrows taking,
Never leaving or forsaking;
God be with you till we meet again.
--------------
5. God be with you till we meet again;
Ended when for you earth’s story,
Israel’s chariot sweep to glory;
God be with you till we meet again.</article>

She loved to hear him, a great tenor, sing it back in "the day" (she'll be 100 next week!)
Good day!</article>

At my church growing up it was filled with military families.The last service before they deployed we would sing this song. It was 8 years before they were playing it for my family.

	<article author="nnamdi asomugha (snr)" email="" city="Abuja" provst="" country="Nigeria" month="9" day="8" year="2008">God be with you till we meet again was a popular song sang in Ibo laguage-southeast Nigeria-during burial ceremonies. It was a grave hymn so to speak. That was when I was a child chorister. But now I feel it should be a family song, to be sang as the family rises in the morning to go about their various chores; work, school etc. How meaningful.</article>
