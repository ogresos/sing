	<article author="Nadia" email="" city="Federal Way" provst="WA" country="United States" month="6" day="9" year="2012">For a long time I've been longing for completion. Acceptance. Approval. Satisfaction. I sought it from my parents. I sought it from men. I sought it in clothing. Careers. Friends. Sports. Everywhere but in Jesus. It seemed so cliché to love Jesus. It was spoken more as a song than a lifestyle to me. It seemed to me that after all the years I've become immune to the the phrases and the scripture used in church at times. What is loving God? How is it that every one claims to love God one moment and the next they are hurting Him? That can't be love. How is that love? It challenged me to search love in total abandonment until I found it. Well I did. He did. He found me. He has won my heart. His love is the completion of all hurt and loss in life. There really is a moment that you hit, a point of no return. I mean why long for anything else when you have, well..Everything. I shall not want. There is a man. And He will not fail me. It is a guaranteed love. An everlasting love. This man will not put me aside. This man will not lie and deceive. This man is only good. He does not seek to cause me pain for the worse, but for the better. This man will love me even when I fail Him. Again and again. He will persistently seek and search me until He finds me. He won't relent until I am His. All of His. He is a Jealous man. He demands everything from me as the grave. He will yearn for me even more than I can ever yearn for Him. He has already completed me, before I even agreed. And I know that this sort of completion, this love will never be found in any other man. For His Father created me in such a way that I could search the whole world for love and satisfaction, &amp; I will only ever find it in His son.

Jesus is love. Jesus is life. He is the only answer. He is all that I need. Glory.

There is no other source of satisfaction because He is the Creator of our desires and they are given to us to draw us to Him. We are only satisfied in satisfying Him.

It will never be found in any other man. For His Father created me in such a way that I could search the whole world for love and satisfaction, and I will only ever find it in His Son.

Jesus is love. Jesus is life. He is the only answer. He is all that I need. Glory..

There is no other source of satisfaction because He is the Creator of our desires and they are given to us to draw us to Him. We are only satisfied in satisfying Him.</article>

Saints that are feasting,
Not analyzing,
Or criticizing.

	<article author="Esther 靈妙" email="" city="Ho Chi Minh City" provst="" country="Vietnam" month="3" day="7" year="2011">Vietnamese Lyric:

1. Hãy tiến lên!  Phía trước luôn! 
Lòng ta luôn mở ra cho Ngài, Một lòng hoàn toàn yêu Chúa, 
Chú tâm chí hướng nơi Ngài, Đừng nằm dài, ươn yếu!
Hãy Tiến lên! Phía trước luôn! Hướng đến Con!

Điệp Khúc (Chorus)
Chúng tôi những bình đất Chúa nắn đúc khéo thay !
Chúng tôi là người mang hình ảnh của Chúa đây.
Ngài là chính vui mừng tràn ngập khắp lòng tôi!
Làm cho tôi nên giống như Ngài, 
Hoàn toàn biểu hiện Ngài!

2. Hãy tiến lên! Phía trước luôn!
Quạt cho linh cứ luôn cháy bùng, Cho lòng được sục sôi mãi,
Mở ra để cứ ăn Ngài, Và hằng ngày uống Chúa.
Hãy tiến lên! Phía trước luôn! Hướng đến Con!

3. Hãy tiến lên! Phía trước luôn!
Một Linh không có chi giới hạn, Hằng ngày dự tiệc trong Chúa,
Chớ nên chỉ trích phê bình, Đừng làm người phân tích.
Hãy tiến lên! Phía trước luôn! Hướng đến Con!

4. Hãy tiến lên! Phía trước luôn!
Đời ta vui hưởng bao phước hạnh, Không Ngài, đời người vô nghĩa!
Jesus, Chúa của ta tuyệt vời; Ngài, hằng ngày luôn sẵn.
Hãy tiến lên! Phía trước luôn! Hướng đến Con!</article>
