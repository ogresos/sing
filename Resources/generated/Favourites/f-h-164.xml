At a young age, he began to write poetry. For 73 years, he did open air preaching in Britain and other countries. He helped in the Moody-Sankey campaign in 1873-4 and was also in fellowship with the Brethren. - Songs of the Spirit by Martin
Francis' most famous hymn is "O the deep, deep, love of Jesus", which is probably the inspiration for W. Lee's hymn, "O how deep and how far reaching".</article>

And a song that is music to Thee;
A song of a pilgrim to heaven,
Yes, a song from a sinner like me!
