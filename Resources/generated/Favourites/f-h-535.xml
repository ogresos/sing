He will never put his children to shame. The world says it will be impossible but what I know and believe is that if God enabled Sarah, Hannah, Rebecca and Elizabeth to have their own babies, I will also have mine even when my partner thinks it is impossible. With God all things are possible. 
I love this song.</article>

This morning at family devotion, after I'd shared the Word from Ephesians 3:20 with my family, my husband fished out this song and we sang it so believingly. Yes, the power of God is mightily in us and if only we can tap into this Great Power, we will be able to do exploits here on earth. Also, we can begin to call those things that be not as though they were! Praise God!</article>

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="31" year="2008">All three—the written word, the living word, and the applied word—refer to God Himself. "In the beginning was the Word...and the Word was God" (John 1:1). The Word here is a person. God's written word in the Bible becomes Christ as the living word, who is applied into us as the Spirit, the word of the Spirit. That is God Himself. The more that God is gained by you in this way, the more He becomes your faith.

Thus, the source of faith is God. He is the One who calls things not being as being and gives life to the dead (Rom. 4:17). In Genesis 1, there was no light, so God said, "Let there be light," and light was there (v. 3). We are related to God through these three aspects of His word: the written word, the living word, and the applied word. Then we enjoy God as the One who calls not being as being and who gives life to the dead. Nothing is impossible to faith (see Hymns, #535), because faith is actually God Himself.
...
In Matthew 17:20b the Lord spoke concerning the effect of faith: "If you have faith like a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, Move from here to there, and it will move; and nothing will be impossible to you." Nothing is impossible to faith. Hymns, #535, written by Charles Wesley, expresses this effect of faith:
...
Only God is all-able, omnipotent; nothing is impossible to Him (Matt. 19:26). But the Lord also indicates that nothing is impossible to faith. So this indicates faith and God, God and faith, are one. If you do not have God, God remains apart from you. If you have God in you, this God becomes faith. Faith is the subjective God applied to your being. Thus, just as nothing is impossible to God, nothing is impossible to faith.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="25" year="2008">In the previous message we pointed out Hymns, #535 by Charles Wesley. I like his hymns very much, but I had never paid much attention to this hymn until recently. There is a wonderful line in stanza 5 which says, "Let me no longer live, but Thee." It is marvelous that such a line is in this hymn on faith. Faith is to believe that God is, and I am not. I do believe that Charles Wesley must have noticed this point. Otherwise, how could he have said in his hymn: "Let me no longer live, but Thee." This is faith. Faith always annuls us and reveals Christ to us.
