Totally unexpected, God The Father asked someone to marry Him, in 2007, late in 2007. She said yes, but not instantly. He reassured her twice she was up to it. On the third day, she trusted Him, and said yes. It is complicated.</article>

	<article author="Precious Grace Catindig" email="" city="" provst="" country="Philippines" month="8" day="11" year="2012">I enjoyed the video training in the Minor Prophets. Hosea reveals that we are all like "Gomer"- a prostitute having a dreadful background who was far from spotless. We have found many lovers and utterly forsook our husband. 

However God's heart was not touched from this betrayal. We should not think of ourselves as a dutiful, submissive, utterly faithful ones. We need to realize THERE IS A PARTICULAR LOVE IN GOD TOWARDS US, HIS PERSPECTIVE SPOUSE THAT ENABLES HIM TO PERSIST AND EVENTUALLY TO CONQUER EVERY NEGATIVE THING. HOW AMAZING!</article>
