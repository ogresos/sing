    <article author="Isaiah Tor" city="Sydney" provst="NSW" country="Australia" month="8" day="25" year="2008">This hymn was written from the vantage point of the heavenlies, concerning the Father God's faithfulness. Every verse of this hymn emphasizes the Lord's unchanging faithfulness not in a mundane, pedestrian sense, but much rather in the riches of who He is in this attribute of His Godhead. This hymn is not monochromic, but rather in regards to the "rainbow round about His throne", which in principle matches the foundations of the New Jerusalem as the holy city, the Lord's faithfulness is resplendent and overflowing with a rich expression of who He is and the solid representation of who He is to us in His faithfulness to make us that holy city, the New Jerusalem.</article>
