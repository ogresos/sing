when he boarded the bus there was such a sweet fragrance. Sitting on the bus was a group of women who had worked all day long in a perfume factory. They didn't realize it, but they gave off the sweet smell of being in the perfume's presence. May we be those who after spending time in His presence become the fragrance of Christ wherever we are placed in our daily life! "Within the veil His fragrance poured on thee, Without the veil, that fragrance shed abroad"!</article>
    <article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="4" day="1" year="2008">A hymn such as #642 in Hymns does not merely teach us. On the contrary, it unveils spiritual reality to us. Our need is not just to learn doctrines, but to open ourselves to the Lord so that we can see something. We should pray, "Lord, I open myself to You. I want to see more of You as an all-inclusive Person. Show me how Your all-inclusive death and resurrection includes me." Then as we listen to the speaking concerning Christ, we will begin to see something. What we see becomes a reality within us. Then we live by what we have seen.
