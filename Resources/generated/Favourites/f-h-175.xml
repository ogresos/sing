Mrs. Busby tells me it's sad that Hollywood exploits the name of God by saying "Jesus Christ!" to be mean to Fairest Lord Jesus, but we will resiliently honor Fairest Lord Jesus!</article>
	<article author="Danny Kreiser" email="dfkreiser@gmail.com" city="Braden" provst="TN" country="United States" month="3" day="13" year="2016">Writers of scripture have tried to tell of the glory and beauty of the Heavenly Bridegroom using such metaphors: Lily of the Valley, Bright and Morning Star, Rose of Sharon, Fairest of ten thousand, Fairer than all the fair. Yet the truth is that human tongue simply cannot adequately describe the beauty of Him who loved and gave himself for us. Though in His flesh there was "no beauty that we should desire him"(Is. 53:2-3), yet when viewed through the eye of faith He is altogether lovely! "Glory and honor, praise, adoration now and forevermore be Thine"!!!</article>

He is the dearest and most wonderful Person. He actually does meet every need I have. He is my life, my living, my health and my provision. Is there any one or any thing that can match Him? Obviously not! The more I experience Him and His love to me the more I love Him. Thank God for hymns like this one that point us to Him.</article>
	<article author="Frank Pytel" email="" city="Chicago" provst="Illinois" country="United States" month="5" day="25" year="2011">This hymn came to mind this morning with the repeated use of the word "fair". In the Song of Songs this word "fair" is also repeated about ten times, having the meaning of exceedingly beautiful. Isn't this a great word to describe the One we love! He is exceedingly beautiful! In the Song of Songs the Bridegroom is firstly called fair by His lover; then later in the song the bride is called fair by her Beloved. As we are joined to Him we bear His fairness, His exceeding beauty! The Bride displays the exceeding beauty of her Bridegroom! This mutual love is exceedingly beautiful!</article>
