I was thinking about the truths I believe about my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, the song came into my mind. I was not sure of the complete lyric and went to the net to find it. Shall appreciate if I have the sol fa notation of the song.
Great hymn. Thank you.</article>

It testifies to the power Scripture truth set to music. It belongs in every Christian hymnal and sung by every choir!</article>

Perhaps you will want to change it.</article>
