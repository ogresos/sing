Oh how much we need to give the Lord a way to head us up!</article>

I hope sing this "before the throne" as part of the "new song."</article>

Let You rule and reign.

That’s what we desire—
A heart for You".</article>

I like how it says "we can call O Lord, we can praise Your name". The word in spanish used for "can" (poder) is the same word for "power", so another way to look at those lines is "we have the power to call O Lord! we have the power, we are able, to praise Your name!"

Call O Lord and praise His name saints!</article>
