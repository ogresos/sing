	<article author="Mheanne" email="sisterakas2013@gmail.com" city="Makati" provst="" country="Philippines" month="3" day="7" year="2013">Lord Jesus, I and my family adore only You. Only You can manipulate our lives. For You are the living God. You work in a sevenfold intensified way. You came and died to bear our sins. Now, we are one with You. Sorry for the times we are doubtful. Sorry for the times we have a weak faith. Sorry for the times we hurt You. Cause us to be faithful and not live apart from You. Glory to You!</article>
