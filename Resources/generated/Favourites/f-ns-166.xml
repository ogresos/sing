You loved us so much that You, the perfect, unblemished, faultless, flawless man willingly died for our sins. Thank You for Your redemption, purchasing us back with Your blood. You died and rose as a man, in order to impart life in me. What an amazing love You have for us. Lord Jesus, I love You not only for what You have done but also for who You are!</article>

	<article author="Raquel Dominguez" email="" city="Lake Elsinore" provst="California" country="United States" month="6" day="9" year="2012">Hosea 11:4 says "I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love..." The footnote in the Recovery Version says that God loves us with His divine love not on the level of divinity but on the level of humanity. God's love is divine but it reaches us in the cords of a man. Through Christ's humanity! The cords through which God draws us include Christ's incarnation , human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. It is by all these steps of Christ in His humanity that God's love in His salvation reaches us. God's unchanging, everlasting, and subduing love is prevailing because it is a love in Christ, with Christ, by Christ, and for Christ! This hymn helped me appreciate the process the Lord went through in his humanity. Through such a process His unchanging, eternal, divine love has reached us and constrained us! Oh Lord we love You!!!!</article>
