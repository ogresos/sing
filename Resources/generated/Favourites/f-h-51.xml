The revelation of the Father and the Son in union, fellowship and eternal delight is overwhelming. Even more, for us to participate in THIS comes without words to describe our blessed place in Christ, the Son. May many responses of love come forth as we draw nearer to our Source, and kiss our loving Father in worship as sons!</article>
