	<article author="Daniel Chen" email="danielchenrules@gmail.com" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="10" day="14" year="2013">Because of a fall retreat I just came back from, I have a new appreciation of this song. During the retreat, the main topic was Noah and the ark, and we discussed how the ark signifies the church, and how everything outside is just of the world. 

The lines, "O the joy to hear Your call
And enter in the Ark.
Saving us from day to day
O Lord, this is Your way."
Just show us how precious the ark and the church is, how we need to be saved from day to day.

Another aspect that was discussed was the matter of the raven and the dove: both were part of the ark, but once released, the dove came back, but the raven disappeared, most likely to eat of the dead carcasses, symbolizing the things of the world. 
The beginning of the second stanza:
"Seeking of this age to taste,
And of it have a part.
If we only knew, dear Lord,
The ways we grieve Your heart."
We should not be "seeking of this age," eating of the things of the world like the raven: we should be like the dove, who always returns to the ark.</article>

	<article author="Rita" email="" city="Kampala" provst="" country="Uganda" month="4" day="1" year="2011">Wow, I love this song and reading thru the saints' sharing am more impressed with it esp David Beach's sharing. We need the Body, we cannot easily stay afloat above this wicked age on our own, while pursuing with the saints we are kept, and are stirred to lay every thing on the ocean floor. Dearest Lord You've called us here and opened up Your heart, praise You dearest Lord.</article>

	<article author="David Beach" email="" city="Beltsville" provst="MD" country="United States" month="1" day="31" year="2011">This song has two particularly engaging aspects: first, while it is simply written, it bears a deep level of experience in seeing how the Lord operates. Starting with a simple prayer of thanks, it recognizes (in verse two) that we sometimes "taste of the world," and fail. Yet, "all the things that we once loved are on the ocean floor." The final verse ends with the reminder that we are "in the church, the ark." The second aspect is that these experiences, though recognized and gained by us, are not simply individual experiences. Throughout the song, the words used reflect the corporate aspect. Words such as "us," and "we," remind us that entering, experiencing and remaining in the Ark--the church--is indeed a corporate experience which we cannot expect to do on our own. How we need not only a deeper understanding of what the Lord has done in saving us, but also a richer set of experiences of the Body life, as we pursue in the safety of the Ark, today in the church life.</article>
