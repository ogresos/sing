    <article author="Jerald Imperial" city="Church In Malabon" provst="" country="Philippines" month="8" day="5" year="2010">Loving the Lord with all our heart is our best and unique cooperation with the Lord to carry out His good pleasure. By telling Him, "Lord, make Your home in my heart", He would be able to saturate and spread in us, until His work is done. The more we tell Him that we love Him, the more we will be drawn to Him, thus we will be captured and be captivated by Him. Lord Jesus we love You!</article>
