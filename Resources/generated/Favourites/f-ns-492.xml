I've experienced people misunderstanding the "love" part of the relationship. But, how sad that people do not realize that we can love God and He loves us, always.</article>

What a beautiful sentiment between a person and her Love. I also appreciate and enjoy the tune because it's not the cookie-cutter formula we have in so many newer songs.

I do wish "Thee" (King James medieval English) had not been mixed with "You"; one should always use one or the other. And we today prefer to use "you."</article>
