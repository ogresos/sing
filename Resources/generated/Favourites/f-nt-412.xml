Knowing full well there is no hope in my flesh. And if there is any hope for help, change and new life that only in the Christ of the Bible, that Holy Son of God, is forgiveness and strength and grace to overcome. Not in me but in Him. He is able to do above and beyond in me and in us what we ask or think. He sees my heart, knows my weakness. Please Lord help me to sin less and love more. One day we will be at Your throne and all I will have to give is my thanks for who YOU are. For in me dwells nothing of merit. Just that You oh Lord in Your grace looked down and sent YOUR ONLY SON to take my place for the sin I am. Thank You, Thank You Amen.</article>
