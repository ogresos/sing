 Flesh and blood His substance
He took the form of man,
 Revealed the hidden plan.
O glorious myst’ry,
 Sacrifice of Calv’ry,
And now I know Thou art the great “I AM.”
Once Satan touched man, God stepped in to act... and this is according to God's sovereignty!
I just have to praise the Lord for the process He went through of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, He became the Spirit and ascended as a Man! Now as the Spirit (2 Cor. 15:45b) He lives in us (Col. 1:27) spreading and making His home in all our hearts (Eph. 3:17) in order to build us up together to be His corporate dwelling place (Eph. 2:22) for His satisfaction and rest for all eternity (Rev. 21:2).

	<article author="Dawn" email="dawnyriver2@yahoo.com" city="Mv" provst="NY" country="United States" month="3" day="19" year="2014">Satan has managed to remove these songs from the church, replacing them with shallow, irreverent songs with bad theology. Hence the Church has become weak, ineffective. Worship has become mundane.</article>
	<article author="Mike Thomas" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="10" day="31" year="2013">My wife and I sing this song as a duet, she adds a little flare but we keep the basic music in tact. It's a great hymn that few people know about. Bless Mr. Booth for putting this to song.</article>

	<article author="Aaron" email="aaron_kiwi@hotmail.com" city="Hamilton" provst="" country="New Zealand" month="4" day="28" year="2013">The last line in the last verse says I AM. This was in Exo. 3:14 - And God said to Moses, I AM WHO I AM. And He said, Thus you shall say to the children of Israel,  I AM has sent me to you. Then in John 18:6 - When therefore He (Jesus) said to them, I am, they drew back and fell to the ground. Jesus claim to be not only the son but also the very God himself
The divine title I am denotes that God is the One who is self-existing and ever-existing and who depends on nothing apart from Himself.</article>

	<article author="Jimmy Melegrito" email="" city="Chula Vista" provst="California" country="United States" month="10" day="15" year="2012">I'm going to sing this song about my only Savior and Lord. Take note that I say 'Savior and Lord'. Not Lord and Savior. I firmly believe that before I could serve Him as my Lord I must accept Him first as my Savior - surrendering to His saving ways and means and what He has done for me. Now what must I do for Him as my Lord. This is a relationship formula: Sinner and Savior; Servant and Lord.</article>
	<article author="Adriana Scheffer" email="" city="Victoria" provst="BC" country="Canada" month="9" day="17" year="2012">This song makes my heart to worship my wonderful Saviour. What a glorious message it tells. Yes, how is it possible that our great Creator would stoop to make us fallen people His own children. Oh how I praise Him, how I adore Him, my Redeemer.</article>
	<article author="J K Petoskey" email="" city="North Myrtle Beach" provst="South Carolina" country="United States" month="4" day="29" year="2012">A grand anthem of the apostolic church moves the soul and challenges the intellect all at once. A sermon in a song that makes you feel something, makes you think about something, and makes you want to do something; all 3 critical elements of a sermon.</article>

	<article author="Tom Cooper" email="" city="Mason" provst="MI" country="United States" month="1" day="21" year="2012">While reading and meditating upon the Lord Jesus the words of this Hymn came to my mind as I thought of my Savior.

His Birth: There Was No Room
His Life: HE SOUGHT NO ROOM
HIS SORROW: HE NEEDED NO ROOM (GETHSEMANE)

	<article author="Joyce Vieselmeyer Baker" email="" city="Nampa" provst="Idaho" country="United States" month="12" day="5" year="2011">William Booth-Clibborn was a very close family friend who spent numerous days in our home. The glory of the Lord portrayed in "Down From His Glory" was what the lyrics author lived &amp; preached. He was a large man who lived for the Lord but what full fun &amp; humor. His dramatic preaching style made each sermon unforgettable and helped develop my deep love for the Lord. I under 5 yrs. of age when he came to town to hold meeting. My parents were immediately moved by the Holy Spirit through his teaching. As he became a 'member' of our family he told us kids to call him Uncle Booth, however, due respect we most often referred to him as Brother Booth. He loved to stand over the kitchen stove and dictate to my mother how to cook his favor cow tongue and how to steep his tea perfectly. On one of his overseas journeys he sent us a tea cozy from Japan. It is not washable and continues to remain in my china hutch with tea stains on it. Brother Booth loved hunting ducks. We lived on a dairy farm with a creek running through it. Brother Booth came to stay several weeks in December so he could hunt and work on getting his Christmas Letter out to over 1,000 locations. He welcomed me to sit around the dining room table to lick stamps, envelopes and apply address labels. Before turning in for the night he would pick up his violin to serenade us with heavenly music. He encourage me to play the piano and sing along. He was my greatest inspiration to sing in church. Of course "Down From His Glory" was the favorite to sing. I could write a book about his visits to our home and us to his. I didn't like the noise, lights &amp; sirens from his busy street near The Lloyd's Center in Portland. I was too much of a country girl.

My mother passed away May, 2002. William Booth-Clibborn was mentioned at her memorial and "Down From His Glory" closed the service. What a heritage he left us!</article>
	<article author="Hobert Adams" email="" city="Willard" provst="HI" country="United States" month="11" day="7" year="2011">One of the most anointed songs I have ever heard. This song speaks of His great glory, and demands our fullest attention. This song speaks of the fulness and glory of our God, brought down to humiliation and death for the sake of mankind. i am a retired minister, up in years, but i still sing the song, "Down from His glory".</article>
	<article author="Rebecca Steagall" email="" city="Eleva" provst="WI" country="United States" month="10" day="22" year="2011">The first time I heard this beautiful song I was 13 years old and heard our choir director sing it as a solo in the 1960s. It touched my heart then and still does today. Sadly, they don't sing these wonderful old songs in churches today. My grandfather knew William Booth-Clibborn and had him preach at the Pentecostal Assembly church in Eau Claire where my grandfather J.P. Rulien was pastor. I feel the Holy Spirit so strongly in this song even today. Praise the Lord!</article>
	<article author="Marlena Gaspar" email="" city="Lisbon" provst="CT" country="United States" month="9" day="17" year="2011">I am so thankful that the Lord brought this old song back to my memory: The Great Creator became 'my' Savior &amp; all God's fullness dwells not only in 'Him' but according to Col. &amp; 1 Jn 4:17 'as He is in the earth so are we!'. Oh Wondrous Mys'try! I SHALL EVER SING YOUR PRAISES: OH HOW I LOVE HIM, WHO IS MY LIFE, STRENGTH, MY ALL IN ALL!</article>
	<article author="Romy Monteyro" email="" city="Scottsdale" provst="Arizona" country="United States" month="8" day="24" year="2011">It is truly incomprehensible that God would die for man's sin. But that it happened because God so loved the word is cause for never ending wonderment. We are sinners--undeserving of His love, but He chose to die in our place that we may have salvation. Oh how I truly love Him! This song says it all! Praise the Lord indeed, for His never ending love!</article>
	<article author="Louie Clavecilla" email="" city="Binan City" provst="Laguna" country="Philippines" month="6" day="30" year="2011">Thank you so much for posting this beautiful hymn.

	<article author="Sharon J. Nelson" email="" city="Kirkland" provst="Washington" country="United States" month="3" day="15" year="2011">The man who wrote the lyrics of this beautiful song, William Booth Clibborn, was the grandson of the founder of the Salvation Army and one of my father's best friends. What a man! Large in stature, English, had a mustache and told us the stories of his accomplishment of swimming the English Channel. A great man of God. I was priviledged to know him and this song is probably one of my top Christian songs. My mother, who had a beautiful voice, would sing this in church and it never failed to touch hearts. Thank you Lord for your grace and love and for your servant who so appropriately wrote this song that conveys it to us.</article>
