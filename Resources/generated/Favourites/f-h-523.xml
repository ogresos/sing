	<article author="J.A.Heron" email="jaheron24@gmail.com" city="" provst="" country="Germany" month="7" day="15" year="2016">I have come to the Fountain of Joy;
His joy is the strength of my heart.
My delight is unmixed with alloy,
My sunshine can never depart.
The fig tree may wither and die,
Earth’s pleasures and prospects decline;
But my fountains can never be dry—
My portion, my joy is divine.</article>

	<article author="Andrea Benoit" email="abenoit@comcast.net" city="Tacoma" provst="WA" country="United States" month="12" day="4" year="2013">He leads me and I am empowered to "Come to the Fountain of Life." It seems I can't keep myself from straying and stumbling, stubbornly taking and making my own rigorous way - yet when I least expect it and even less deserve it, He shepherds me back to Himself as a waiting Fountain, overflowing with refreshment, health, joy and all that I need and long for. What a bountiful, rich, restorative Fountain He Is - what unfathomed grace and limitless mercy, to bring me back to Himself as the very Author of Life, time and time again, Now and forevermore...</article>
	<article author="Rebecca Berglund" email="" city="" provst="Oregon" country="United States" month="6" day="22" year="2012">To come to the fountain is to come to the source. When we come to this source, which is Jesus in our spirit, we come to the Father as life, even our springing up life; we come to the Triune God's love and sure forgiveness through the Son's flowing blood, righteousness; we come to the sweet balm of health that enters every part of our heart to heal and restore us, peace; we come finally to a fountain of joy because God's kingdom of life has been imparted into us through righteousness,issuing in peace and bubbling up in this estimable joy! This is the kingdom (Romans 14:17)and this is the fountain we can drink of.</article>

He quenches my thirst through His words and also by calling on His name. And this also reminds me when Jesus met a woman at the wells. Drink Him that we shall by no means ever thirst again. Praise the Lord!</article>
