Holy Spirit, we adore Thee!
Searching e'en the depths of God!
Open wide our hearts art to Thee,
Come Thou, fill and transform us!
We adore Thee! We adore Thee!
Thou our newness to impart,
Unto full-grown man will bring us
Glorious bride to Thee become.</article>

Thee we bless, through endless days! 
Thank You dear Father, we praise You, love You &lt;3</article>

"Holy Spirit, we adore thee! Paraclete and heavenly guest
Sent from God and from the Savior, Thou hast led us into rest
We adore Thee, we adore Thee, by thy grace forever blest
We adore Thee, we adore Thee, by thy grace forever blest</article>

That's when I loved it so much. But as the days went by I included it on my best songs which satisfies my soul. Dear Christians please help me. I need to learn how to play this song on piano.</article>

Three in One! we give Thee praise!
For the riches we inherit,
Heart and voice to Thee we raise!

This is a great hymn and one that is new to me. I love it because in it we worship not only one but all three members of the Trinity. Praise be to the Father, Son and Holy Spirit forever! Amen. Blessings!</article>
