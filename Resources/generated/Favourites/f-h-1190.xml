How precious that this God of glory is for us to experience individually and corporately. It is only His personal and vivid: appearing, drawing, strengthening, attracting, shining, speaking, empowering, calling, opening, imparting, keeping, and coming perpetually, relentlessly, regardless of our unending failures, shortcomings; our being in the valleys and dungeons, that we can aspire to be as the forefathers of faith "seeing" the Invisible One to ultimately enter, partake, experience and enjoy the good land, our all-inclusive Christ, the reality of this God-expressed One being—Hallelujah, not as theories, laws, traditions, forms, or religion, but our personal and corporate portion and reality!
O God of glory, today and day-by-day!</article>

I've been learning and enjoying this hymn, as a hymn of the week in Week 20 of Volume 4, HWMR on Crystallization-study of Genesis....Jehovah God, the originator, the God of the Most High, the Possessor of heaven and earth, had been a compassionate friend to Abraham, appearing to him in human level again and again, in fact for the twelfth time, so He can infuse His glory to His friend Abraham! Lord, we all as seeds of Abraham, may You also continue to appear to us, again and again, until we all gain the Canaan land—it's today's our all-inclusive land—Christ—the real Isaac!</article>
