    <article author="Michael" city="Dunbar" provst="WI" country="United States" month="8" day="5" year="2010">This is an interesting new set of lyrics to a very old tune. The original lyrics are called "Power in the Blood".

Very nice and I will use these lyrics at some point in my church.</article>

I love many hymns here, but I cannot sing them fluently; my English is poor. But I have a pure heart. I 'm praying that the Lord can provision a partner to me and enjoy these hymns together. Praise the Lord!</article>
    <article author="pelitasteven" city="Evansville" provst="IN" country="United States" month="7" day="23" year="2009">because of the wonderful overcoming power deep within, my/our wavering "will" is gone... and it strengthened and filled in one spirit. My/our weak "emotion" no more... for there's an open heart and speaking love. My/our bounded "mind" has released...and it is healthy and perfectly sound.

So Praise the Lord! The 3 parts of my/our soul (will, emotion, mind) there's an OVERCOMING POWER DEEP WITHIN.</article>
