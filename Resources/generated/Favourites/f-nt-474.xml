Praise the Lord!</article>
	<article author="Cathy Thompson" email="" city="Garden Grove" provst="California" country="United States" month="10" day="11" year="2008">Through the years, I have enjoyed this hymn so deeply because of Mrs. Davison's testimony and deep subjective experience and high bibical truth expressed and conveyed in her words of this hymn. She saw that we have a union with the Lord in our human spirit sharing His human life filled with His humanity, that in His crucifixion we died in Him, that we rose with Him in His resurrection, that day by day in His ascension my life is in Him, and that in His enthronement I share in His authority.</article>

I am thankful that He is our processed and consumated Life-giving Spirit because now I am one with Him and nothing can change that!!! "..Day by day I share Thy riches, Thou art everything to me".</article>
