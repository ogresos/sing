	<article author="Jc" email="jessiedownloads@gmail.com" city="Kigali City" provst="Kigali" country="Rwanda" month="11" day="27" year="2012">Hello Ms Doris, as I read your story, there is one thing I would like to share with you. You are somebody special in the eyes of the Lord, and He is more than able to perform great wonders in your life, at one condition: trust, believe and rely on Him 100%. Stop looking at your problem, instead look upon the Lord, and while you trust Him, have that picture of the thing that you want (a daughter who delights in her mother and who demonstrates the virtues of a Christian) and start praising the Lord for that. Have faith, and stop looking on circumstances. If God doesn't recognize something, don't recognize it either. Rejoice in the Lord, the One who is able to do exceedingly, abundantly above, all we can dare ask or think of, according to the power that works within us. Make bold declaration, confess with your mouth that your daughter is in the right path, even if visibly she isn't, but remember the fig tree didn't dry up that day when Jesus spoke, and yet He had already spoken. Get the picture of what you want, speak that very thing, and you shall see it happen. You are abundantly and greatly blessed.</article>
	<article author="Doris Cash" email="" city="Ramona" provst="California" country="United States" month="10" day="2" year="2012">Hello Cheryl.. you have given me so much hope.. Praise God.. I forget that I have commented on the bad experience, I had, while visitng my daughter; and just now found it, looking for a hymn in my favorites. God surely led me to your letter. I "out of the blue" brought it up! but, Praise God, I do have my son and my younger daughter back in mine with her life again! They have had bad experinces with her also; and; they have accepted me back again after 3 years, after I stayed away from the older daughter. I don't like to be partial though; and I am a very forgiving person. They need to forgive also. Please pray for them...
And... God is continuing to heal the wounds..
I Praise God for your comforting comment!
Love in Christ...</article>
	<article author="Cheryl" email="" city="In The HEAVENS" provst="The Kingdom Of Our God!" country="" month="9" day="18" year="2012">Ms Doris, Praise God, He is caring for you as you go through this trial! Continue to pray. The Lord is not through with you or your daughter. And we knot that ALL things work together for the good of those that love God, to those who are called according to HIS purpose. Because those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated us to be conformed to the image of His Son (Romans 8:28-29a). This situation with your daughter is part of yours and her divine transformation process. Praise the Lord! We serve a God who is faithful and just. Be confident in this very thing, that He who has begun in you will complete it until the day of Christ Jesus (Philippians 1:6) Be encouraged, sister.</article>
	<article author="Joshua Dogara Amstrong" email="" city="Abuja" provst="FCT" country="Nigeria" month="7" day="25" year="2012">When I think of His love to me I am speechless. Sometimes I wonder what have I done to deserve such great love. Despite the fact that I am a sinner but He love me anyway. Lord Jesus thank You so much. May Your name be glorified and exalted forever, Amen.</article>
	<article author="Doris  Cash" email="" city="Ramona" provst="California" country="United States" month="5" day="27" year="2012">I play this beautiful hymn on my piano; and sing along with it.. I couldn't remember the words of the 3rd. line.. but; I got on the internet; and Praise God, here it is..
I have gone through so much hurt.. My daughter pushed me down and I fell to the floor; and beginning to kick me.. but, thank God, He was with me; and still is.. I made it back home (driving 450 miles) with my 13 year old cat.. to my home in San Diego County.. God was with me; and I got home safely!
Please pray for me.. she still is harrassing me; with her lies.. but, thank God, without Him, I couldn't make it.. That life she lives is not for me; and she wasn't raised this way.. something has changed in her.. I believe it could be her boyfriend.. she committed her life to the Lord 30 years ago; and he doesn't know the Lord.. so please remember them both in prayer. 
I believe the Lord revealed to me, not to make the move up to where she lives.. I drove up there to look; and it is not for me.. I don't approve of the lifestyle.. I have lived here in my town for 58 years; and I just praise God that He has shown me what I needed to know..
I'm 80 years old; and with Him, I could not make it.. It is very hurting to know she did this, I would say for no reason.. But, I do feel strongly; and after much prayer, she wanted me up there to move in with me, with her live in boyfriend; and take over my finances.. Please pray for her (she is 59 yrs. old); and she has had to had "snapped".. I pray that she will get help..
Please pray that she will stop her lies; and continue to give me peace; and that my grandchildren will become to know the truth.. But, she is their mother; and God will someday reveal to them the truth.. but, I feel they already know..
Thank You so much!
In His Name..
Praise God!! 
Doris
p.s. I failed to add that this beautiful hymn is bringing me peace; and now, I know the exact words, I can continue to play it on my piano and sing along with it..  I knew it was in the book of Psalms somewhere; but couldn't find it.. Thanks so much!</article>
