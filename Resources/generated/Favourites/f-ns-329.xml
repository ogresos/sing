But when we flee them with "those who call" (which is the church), it would be easier for us. That's why, we must not only depend on the Lord, but also on the brothers and sisters in the church.</article>

    <article author="Huyen Nguyen" email="" city="Garden Grove" provst="CA" country="United States" month="5" day="19" year="2011">Amen! I have been enjoying this song pretty much since I received the Channel Only CD from a saint. In the past, I had been focusing on the world, rather than the Lord, Himself. Now, I really want to be washed in the blood of the Lord again. I want to be washed by His blood every day and every moment, so that I can be cleaned from the unclean things to be one of the useful vessels for the Lord. Sometimes, I felt really depressed by contacting the things in the world; however, whenever I turned to the Lord, He made my heart full of joy. Praise the Lord! Fleeing the world and pursuing righteousness, peace, love be with those who call on the Lord out of the pure in heart!</article>
