God's incarnation was a dispensing. In eternity past, God remained in Himself. But at one point He made a counsel not to remain in Himself any longer. He desired to bring His divinity into humanity, and He prophesied concerning His desire in Genesis 3:15. However, this promise was not fulfilled until Mary conceived in Matthew 1. Because He was very patient, our God was silent for four thousand years.

At the time of the Lord's incarnation, God did not come to visit man as He had done with Adam. This time He entered into the womb of a virgin, remained there for nine months, and was born of her to be a God-man. As a man, He is Emmanuel (Matt. 1:23), God with us. Through incarnation God dispensed Himself into humanity. From the day of His incarnation, God no longer remained only in His divinity. He now remains in both divinity and humanity. The incarnation of Christ was the dispensing of God Himself into humanity. Christ is a real man, a perfect man, yet within Him is also the complete God. Hence, He is the God-man.

Today in the heavens He is still a man. The subject of Hymns, #62 is Christ's humanity, and the fourth stanza of this hymn indicates that in the heavens Christ is still a man:

In the time which God appointed
Thou wilt come, dear Lord, again,
With the glory of the Father,
Still appearing as a man.
Even on the throne of judgment
Son of man Thou still wilt be;
And with this, our human nature,
Thou forevermore wilt be.

Stephen saw Christ as the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God after His ascension (Acts. 7:56). In His second coming, Christ will be a man (Matt. 26:64). Christ has also been appointed by God to be the Judge of the living and the dead (Acts. 10:42). Because He is a man, God has given Him the authority to judge men (John 5:22, 27). According to the New Testament, God has authorized the man Jesus to judge the living at His coming, before the millennium on His throne of glory (Matt. 25:31-46), and the dead after the millennium on the great white throne (Rev. 20:11-15). In eternity He will still be a man (John 1:51).

Today on the earth the dispensing of God Himself into humanity includes not only Christ but also all of His believers. Hallelujah, Christ is the God-man, and we also are God-men. Jesus is the dispensing of God Himself into humanity, and we too are the dispensing of God Himself into humanity.
