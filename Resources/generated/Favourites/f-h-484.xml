This has to be one of the highest songs of all time. To live the Christian life. This is the basic question we all face, how to really live it, right? We make a good show, but we always feel short, if we are honest with ourselves. The answer is in this song: we can't and won't live it....because He is the only one who can, and He does. He did not just die for us, He also lives for us, Hallelujah! If we take this as doctrine, we'll say: "Yes, I know, I was crucified with Him and resurrected, ho-hum, I learned that in grade school." But if you see it, if your eyes are really open, you will say: "unbelievable - it is right here in black and white and I missed it all this time - Not I, but Christ. Not I, but Christ. I found the secret. Not I, but Christ."</article>
