	<article author="Betty Jane Bonn" email="" city="Dunlap" provst="Illinois" country="United States" month="7" day="15" year="2012">"Praise Him, Praise Him, All Ye Little Children" is a song from my childhood that went straight to my heart and stayed there.
Praise Him, love Him, thank Him are as good admonitions to me today as they were then--and I wholeheartedly respond to the God Who is Love now as then! 

"Serve Him" is another verse I remember.

This scripture comes so readily to mind:
 
Matthew 18:1-5 (KJV) 
1 At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? 
2 And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them, 
3 And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. 
4 Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. 
5 And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me. 
God bless these words to our hearts!</article>
