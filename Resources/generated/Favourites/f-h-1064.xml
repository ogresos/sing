	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="4" day="16" year="2016">Arabella Katherine (Kate) Hankey's family worshiped with an evangelical sect called "the Clapham group", which was associated with William Wilberforce, an important statesman and humanitarian who is especially remembered for his work to abolish the slave trade.
Kate never married and spent her entire life in religious activities: teaching Bible classes for working women, supporting foreign missions, and visiting the sick. In 1866 she became seriously ill, and during a long period of convalescence she wrote a poem of 50 stanzas in 2 parts, based on the life of Christ and called "The Old, Old Story". In the 1st section, she included stanzas that were later set to music and published as a gospel song entitled "Tell Me the Old, Old Story." In the latter part of the poem, she included other stanzas that begin, "I love to tell the story." None of Miss Hankey's original poem was intended to be sung, but those 2 songs are still heard in churches today.
"I Love to Tell the Story" explains *why* the singer loves to tell this story: 1st, "because I know 'tis true"; 2nd because "it satisfies my longings as nothing else can do"; 3rd, because "some have never heard the message of salvation from God's own Holy Word"; and 4th, because "those who know it best seem hungering and thirsting to hear it like the rest."
Actually, in these lines, Kate Hankey gives only a broad outline of the actual story she loved to tell - and did tell in the remaining unsung lines of her long poem. The story is not confined to the 33 years of Jesus' earthly life. It begins in the glory of God's eternal presence, when God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit purposed to create the universe, which would contain a planet called Earth. This planet would be the home of a human race with whom God would share His love and His fellowship.
The poem continues with a description of the actual work of creation narrated in Genesis 1 and includes the failure of the 1st human beings to respond properly to God's loving gifts. The story tells of God's continuing actions to save His people, especially through His covenants with Abraham and Moses, and His mighty, loving deeds on behalf of the Hebrew people.
The narrative reaches its climax when God's eternal Son renounces His glory to live among us humans, to minister to all human need, to show us how we should live and serve Him, and finally, to die on the cross and rise again from the dead to make that possible.
Yet the story goes on. Jesus ascended into heaven, where He now acts as our Intercessor, pleading our cause with the Father. One day He will return to take believers to live eternally in God's presence, where "telling the story" will be our joyful, unending occupation!
Finally, this is not just one story among many. In all the world's libraries, this is *the* story - the most important story in all history. For every human being is included in that story of "Jesus and His love." - Donald Hustad, organist for Billy Graham Crusades</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="Michigan" country="United States" month="10" day="25" year="2015">"This is the message of a person who believes with all his heart in what he is singing. He loves to tell people the story, knowing that they too will believe and join him in marching to the ultimate goal. This gospel hymn was one of the big ones back in the days of the Moody and Sankey revival meetings. It became so popular that people whistled it as they walked along the street. I do it myself sometimes - which means either I'm old-fashioned or the song is still good. Maybe both!" - Tennessee Ernie Ford (1919-91)
Ernie recommends:
1st &amp; 2nd stanzas: Solo voices
4th stanza: All voices in unison
(Ernie's version didn't have the 3rd stanza.)
Refrains: All voices in unison, sing in 4-part harmony from piano accompaniment.
a joyful tempo

Sally 8/3/2015 from my own state of Michigan: It's ok not to enjoy this hymn. People have different and changing preferences. But don't look down on people who love this hymn. It expresses what is in one's heart. How often do you read the whole Bible with the Psalms? Thanks for sharing.</article>
	<article author="David E Thompson" email="davidet99@gmail.com" city="Mantachie" provst="MS" country="United States" month="10" day="17" year="2015">I too am very sorry that Sally did not appreciate "The Old Old Story." I would first question her knowledge of scripture, then her commitment to Christ and thirdly what her church affiliation is. Lot of crazy teaching out there that undermines the spirit in which these songs were written.</article>
	<article author="Terry Beals" email="terrybeals@gmail.com" city="Butler" provst="Oklahoma" country="" month="9" day="11" year="2015">I am sad that Sally Porter does not find the joy that the writer intended for the Christian in this great and wonderful hymn. It is not for the lost. It is for the saved who reflect upon that day when God, by His grace, saved them. I find it very comforting and moving. It DOES make me realize that I need to tell the story that has meant so much to me.</article>
	<article author="Sally Porter" email="syporter@gmail.com" city="Ironwood" provst="MI" country="United States" month="8" day="3" year="2015">I am overjoyed to be a Christian, but I can't credit this or any other sentimental non-informative song with any influence on my conversion. I find such songs exceedingly irritating. I am always waiting for "the story", the actual facts and reasons. I have a longing for Christ but this singing of longing is not at all satisfying. I prefer real meat. Nice that people are drawn by the song, but I hope they find real truth and grow in faith, not remain sentimental and fool themselves that they are Christians. They could be in for a rueful awakening.</article>

And so you know this is his most favorite hymn in the world. And his memorial I will be singing that song and all of that kind of stuff ;-) .</article>

	<article author="Doris Ross" email="xcmom@aol.com" city="Manassas" provst="Virginia" country="United States" month="11" day="21" year="2014">My great aunt passed this Wednesday, this is one of her favorites. I have been asked to sing it at her funeral. She was 96. The last of a a family of long lived siblings. My grandmother died only 3 years ago at 97. Their oldest sister died at 99. 8 of 11 siblings live into their 90's. It is a sad but triumphant day for all of us as we send her home to rest for eternity with her family.
Just imagine, she started singing it not long after it was written.</article>
	<article author="Evelynne Mccormick" email="evelynnemccormick50@gmail.com" city="Edinburgh" provst="Midlothian" country="United Kingdom" month="10" day="7" year="2014">I first heard this hymn as a young child in Trinity Church of Scotland, on the beautiful Isle of Bute in Scotland, when a young child in the 60s. I'm so thankful to have been given the grace to be able to live this story for nearly 35 years since then. I can't remember hearing this beautiful hymn again till now. Thank you.</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="6" day="8" year="2013">Kate Hankey, the daughter of a prosperous British banker, grew up in a stylish London suburb. She started a Bible class for girls in her neighborhood, and then when she was only 18, Hankey went to London to teach a Bible class of "factory girls." In her 20's, she started other Bible classes for factory girls.
When she was in her early 30's, Kate Hankey became seriously ill. Doctors said she needed a year of bed rest. She was forbidden to teach Bible classes for 12 months. During her long, slow recovery, she wrote 2 lengthy poems. The 1st, at the beginning of her convalescence, later became the hymn, "Tell, Me the Old, Old Story." The 2nd, written 10 months later, became "I Love to Tell the Story."
After 10 months, she felt strong enough to leave her bed. She soon returned to her Bible classes in London and continued teaching for many years. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>
	<article author="Nancy" email="ravannancy@aol.com" city="Greenville" provst="South Carolina" country="United States" month="5" day="9" year="2013">My mother had a unique gift of telling stories. She could tell the Bible stories in such a way that they came alive to all of us in our family and church family. She taught Sunday School for many years and her love for our Lord Jesus was so transparent that it made me long to know him. I received Christ into my heart/life at the age of 12 and still today remember her telling the old old story....of Jesus and His love. She is now in heaven and if my heart tells me correctly, she is still telling the little children up there the old old story with her wonderful talent that the Lord gave her to use for his glory.I hope she knows what her life meant to me and I hope she is having a wonderful Mother's Day! Thank you Lord for giving me such a wonderful Mother.</article>
	<article author="Niki" email="niatrie@aol.com" city="Omaha" provst="NE" country="United States" month="1" day="8" year="2013">We sang this hymn as one of our primary songs during a youth choir competition back in mid 80's in Papua Indonesia. I am thankful those hours spent practicing and treasure it in my heart not because we won the competition but because I need to tell this story to myself over and over again just to remind myself how great Jesus is and not to take His love for granted. Thank You Jesus.</article>
	<article author="Betty Bonn" email="" city="Dunlap" provst="Illinois" country="United States" month="2" day="24" year="2012">Having read the comment by Ronald C. Denhard, I would like to give a similar testimony. As a very young child I heard my mother singing "I Love to Tell the Story" as she ironed. It impressed me so that my mother loved the Lord and implanted a longing deep within my heart to know Him as well. I actually received the Lord when I was 12, during the time of baptismal instruction. I am 71 years old now and have walked with the Lord all these years. I confirm the truth of the words in this hymn: "For those who know it best seem hungering and thirsting to hear it like the rest." Thank God for a Christian mother!</article>
	<article author="Ronald C Denhard" email="" city="London" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="11" day="5" year="2009">I learned this hymn in my youth after I accepted Jesus as Saviour at 15 years of age. Since then 'I love to tell the story' to whoever will listen. I am now 85 years of age and still rejoice in the day I accepted Him. 'Taste and see that the Lord is Good'.</article>

	<article author="Charles Shepherd" email="" city="Felicity" provst="OH" country="U.S.A." month="3" day="3" year="2003">Just another of my favorites, that is not just to sing with but also tells the true story why we, as Christians, do Stand up for our Savior, Jesus Christ.</article>
