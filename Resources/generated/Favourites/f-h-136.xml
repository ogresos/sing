It evokes lovely stirring memories of that wondrous time when we remembered our Lord. Now that I am in my late seventies this hymn and so many like it from the little flock hymn book stir my spirit and bring praise and adoration from my heart to my Saviour Jesus.</article>

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="26" year="2008">Please remember that it is best for any prayers offered after a hymn to follow the feeling conveyed in the hymn. For example, Hymns, #136, "In Thy face once marred and smitten, / All His glory now we read. / Gazing on it we adore Thee, / Blessed, precious, holy Lord." When we reach a high point in the spirit in our singing, we need a prayer to sustain the spirit of the meeting. This means that the words, "Gazing on it we adore Thee, / Blessed, precious, holy Lord;... / Rise our hearts," have brought us to the high point. Then instead of praying doctrinally, we should focus on the last two verses and pray, "Yes, Lord, as we are gazing on Your face, our hearts rise up to praise You." Immediately this prayer is linked to the hymn. Then more prayers should continue to focus on the Lord's glory. The atmosphere of the meeting will then be such that everyone sees the Lord's glory in its utmost purity. Hence, the author of the hymn does not need to say anything except, "Gazing on it we adore Thee, / Blessed, precious, holy Lord." If we can continue praising, the spirit of the meeting will be sustained. After numerous prayers of praise, our hearts will be fully turned to the Lord.
