We are siblings, raised with Christ our Lord through resurrection power. We limit not the truth of God! I heard about this song through a sermon by T. Austin Sparks . . . what a man of God. Though deceased, the truth sent forth through this man's study and life has led me to yet more truth.</article>

	<article author="Christi" email="" city="" provst="MS" country="United States" month="1" day="25" year="2012">George Rawson wrote the words to this song based on a 1620 farewell speech spoken by John Robinson to the pilgrims who were about to set sail on the Mayflower. Here is a portion of that speech:

"I charge you before God and His blessed angels that you follow me no further than you have seen me follow Christ. If God reveal anything to you by any other instrument of His, be as ready to receive it as you were to receive any truth from my ministry, for I am verily persuaded the Lord hath more truth and light yet to break forth from His Holy Word."

Praise the Lord His Word can never be exhausted and will abide forever! The Lord hath yet more light and truth to break forth from His Word!</article>
