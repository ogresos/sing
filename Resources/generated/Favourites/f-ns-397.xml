	<article author="Ann Huang" email="ms17ann@gmail.com" city="Irvine" provst="" country="United States" month="7" day="19" year="2014">"We are totally unable to keep ourselves in the grace of God. There is no guarantee that even five years after we have been saved we will be found in the measure of faith we had in our earlier Christian life. We cannot abide in the grace of God by our own effort; He alone can maintain us in His grace." - WN, "God's Keeping Power"
Lord, I’ve loved You before, but I know that love is unstable. Set me as a seal on Your heart, set me as a seal on Your arm, my trust is not in my holding power but in Your love and strength!</article>

That's is why we really don't want to trust in our own holding power. What we need is the Lord's love and strength. We love because He first loved us.</article>
