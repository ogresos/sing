What is hard for flesh is not hard for love. "God is love." To remain in sweet commune with His strong love that perfects us and builds us into His Body, then we must cling to the love of God planted into our own hearts and abide there. "Love takes the shortest route." the last two stanzas are marvelous in their sweetness. To keep the building of His Body in mind rather than some personal perfection makes the thought in them richer and sweeter.</article>
