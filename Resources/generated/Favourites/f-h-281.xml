	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="5" day="23" year="2013">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, one of the first great American poets, is renowned for works like "Evangeline," The Song of Hiawatha," and "Tales of a Wayside Inn." About the same time that he was writing "Tales of a Wayside Inn," his brother, Samuel Longfellow, was compiling a hymnbook. In this hymnal, Samuel included a hymn he had recently written, "Holy Spirit, Truth Divine." Though Samuel was a minister in the Unitarian [at that time Bible-believing Christians] church, as he grew older, he refused to be called a Unitarian. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton

The original of this song says, "Holy Spirit" instead of "Lord the Spirit". 

There are 2 additional stanzas in the original:
Inserted between stanzas 3 &amp; 4:
Holy Spirit, Right divine,
King within my conscience reign;
Be my Lord, and I shall be
Firmly bound, forever free.

Added at the end:
Now incline me to repent,
Let me now my sins lament,
Now my foul revolt deplore,
Weep, believe, and sin no more.</article>
