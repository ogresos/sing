	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="9" day="14" year="2013">Thomas Kelly was an Irishman through and through, from Kellywatle, Ireland. He studied to be a lawyer like his father, but in the process began to read Christian doctrine. Under conviction of sin, he struggled to find peace with God through fasting and asceticism, but it didn't work. Eventually, he trusted Jesus Christ for the free gift of salvation through faith. He was ordained a minister in the established church, but because of his strong views on salvation by grace, he moved on to serve in independent chapels.
It is said that most of his hymns were focused on Jesus Christ, praising Him for His work on the cross and the glories of heaven. In a way, Kelly writes simply, and yet because his rhyme schemes are unusual, the words become more memorable. This hymn is typical of Kelly, beginning with grateful praise to his Savior and ending with a meditation on heaven. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton
