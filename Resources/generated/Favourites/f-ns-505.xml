After singing this hymn I also have deepest plea to the Lord that He should gain overcomers who can fulfill His economy, His dreams and desire. Amen!!!</article>

I was so touched that this song is talking about a corporate matter. The Lord needs all the members of His body to be His overcomers! Save us from being individualistic Lord.
Make US the overcomers, Your bride and your age-turners. Make US those who consummate the age.</article>

	<article author="Shannon Bay" email="shannonbay@gmail.com" city="Tawa" provst="Wellington" country="New Zealand" month="10" day="5" year="2015">This is a powerful song. I have to sing it at least three times with a stronger spirit each time just to come up to the standard of singing this song. We need songs like this to help us fan our spirits into flame, to not be passive, but strong and active in spirit to resist the oldness and cooperate with the Lord to carry out His move.</article>
