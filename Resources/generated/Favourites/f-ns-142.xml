	<article author="Chosen Cero" email="" city="Aloran" provst="Misamis Occidental" country="Philippines" month="11" day="7" year="2009">This hymn really reminded me once again that sometimes in our Christian life we cannot avoid that we are in this situation that we are anxious in everything BUT the Lord told us, "why worry, when we can pray". So saints, let us pray unceasingly by calling on His name. OH LORD JESUS!!!</article>
	<article author="CL" email="" city="" provst="Ontario" country="Canada" month="2" day="20" year="2009">Whenever we'll realize that the joy of the Lord is our strength, there's really no room for any sort of anxiety in our lives even at this time of recession. 

Let Christ arbitrate in our hearts! Why worry when we can unceasingly pray, praise, breath, eat, and drink Him; call on His name, give Him thanks... just keep enjoying Christ and be filled with Him all the time!</article>
