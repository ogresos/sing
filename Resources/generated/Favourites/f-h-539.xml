	<article author="Isaiah Tor" email="" city="Sydney" provst="NSW" country="Australia" month="8" day="6" year="2008">This hymn presents to us the normal Christian life of having the reality of the Spirit fully and utterly (yet with the full expression and experience of normality in Christ) to the extent we are unceasingly ever one with Him, to the degree according to the last verse of the hymn, where we become in eternity future, the New Jerusalem. It is this normality that we desperately need each day, the gentle, yet all-encompassing flow of the Spirit in our spirit each day. It would be presumptuous to claim having the reality of this hymn in our lives prematurely. Rather this hymn urges us on to practise with a fervent heart of love, a will empowered by Christ in His resurrection power and a mind sober to the extent that there is no element of prideful excitement (according to the saturation of the mingled spirit into our mind, emotion and will) till we be fully and utterly one with Him, spirit, soul and body (1 Cor. 6:17). This is the Body of Christ, consummating in the New Jerusalem.</article>
	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="4" day="1" year="2008">The chorus of #539 in Hymns says: "O Lord, Thou art the Spirit!/How dear and near to me!/How I admire Thy marvelous/Availability!" The Lord today is not only approachable but also available. If food is only approachable to us, this is not sufficient. The food has to be available for us to eat so that we can become one with the food. Approachability is not so good as availability. Today in God's New Testament economy, God is not only approachable but also available to us. The Lord said, "I am the bread of life...he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me" (John 6:35, 57). To eat is to take Him, the available One, as our food. He also said that we need to drink of Him as the living water (John 4:10, 14). In the book of John, all the items concerning Christ are not just approachable. All of them are available—good for us to enjoy, that is, good for us to eat and drink.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="24" year="2008">In today's Christian meetings, we mostly use the New Testament. But when Paul wrote 1 Corinthians 14:26, there was no New Testament as we know it. What they had was mostly the Old Testament. In the ancient times, the time of the first apostles, although the Christians did not have the New Testament, they had many new psalms, hymns, and songs written according to the apostles' teaching. First Timothy 3:16 was probably a quotation of a short song that was very popular in the apostles' time. When they met together, they used these psalms, hymns, and songs very much. Some teachers would say that psalms also refer to the old psalms in the Old Testament. I do not disagree with this, but I believe they used more psalms, hymns, and songs written according to the apostles' teaching for the purpose of meeting. I am very thankful to God that we have a New Testament and a hymnal. Our hymnal is very good for speaking.

We need to learn to speak the stanzas of the hymns in our hymnal. Hymn #539, "O Lord, Thou art the Spirit," is an excellent hymn for speaking to one another. I enjoy singing this hymn, but we also must learn to speak it. The first two words of this hymn—"O Lord"—will stir up the meeting...
