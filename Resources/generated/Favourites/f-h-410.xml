    <article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="8" day="29" year="2013">This hymn, written by Charles Wesley less than 4 years after his conversion, is based on Ps 51:10, "Create in me a clean heart, O God." - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton
------------------------------
The original 3rd line of stanza 1 says:
"A heart that always feels Thy blood" instead of "With conscience sprinkled by the blood"
-------------------------
There are 3 additional stanzas not usually included in hymnals, which come before the last stanza:
----------------------
Thy tender heart is still the same,
 And melts at human woe:
 Jesus, for thee distressed I am,
 I want Thy love to know.
---------------------
My heart, Thou knowâ€™st, can never rest
 Till Thou create my peace;
 Till of mine Eden repossest,
 From self, and sin, I cease.
---------------------------
Fruit of Thy gracious lips, on me
 Bestow that peace unknown,
 The hidden manna, and the tree
 Of life, and the white stone.</article>
