	<article author="Grace Hsieh" email="" city="" provst="" country="Canada" month="9" day="3" year="2008">Wow! I love this song!! I was quite familiar with this tune since I was child. But now when I am singing it again in English, I felt very englightened and joyful! I am especially touched by the last two lines of the chorus. When we are in our spirit, or with the brothers, or even singing this hymn, "we'll make the earth resound with hallehujahs for Christ our land!" This is such as blissful song! hehe!</article>
