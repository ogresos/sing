He was converted at 16 under the preaching of George Whitefield, and he was ordained a Baptist minister at the age of 25. He began his ministry at a poor church in Wainsgate in northern England. The small congregation could only afford to pay him a minimal salary, partly in potatoes and wool.
After 7 years of ministry, Fawcett received a call to the prestigious Carter's Lane Church in London. But as he was saying his farewells [with all his family's belongings already on the wagon] and saw the tears on the faces of his people, he changed his mind and decided to stay.
Not long afterward, he wrote this hymn for the congregation at Wainsgate. He recognized that the bond of love he knew there was worth more than any material wealth. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton
-------------------------------------
The 3rd line of the 1st stanza originally says:
The fellowship of kindred minds
Another version of the 1st line of the 3rd stanza says:
We share each other's woes,
There is an additional stanza before the last stanza:
This glorious hope revives
 Our courage by the way;
 While each in expectation lives,
 And longs to see the day.</article>
