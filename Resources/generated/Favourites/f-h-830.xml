	<article author="Phillip Rowell" email="ashphil.ga@gmail.com" city="Waynesville" provst="Georgia" country="United States" month="6" day="19" year="2015">This is new to me, as much as I hate to admit it. I have selected it as our choir special for Father's Day and everyone knew it, except me! I am younger than most of our choir, but still, I know a lot of the older songs and cannot believe I've never even heard this song until last week, when requested to be done by our piano player. It is beautiful.</article>
	<article author="Jason Appleby" email="jwappleby70@yahoo.com" city="Riverdale" provst="Maryland" country="United States" month="3" day="6" year="2015">This song means so much to me. It depicts how our faith as followers of Christ should be ready to face any adversity at any cost those who have the freedom to worship be thankful those who don't. May your faith in the Lord be strong and steadfast. Praise the Lord!</article>
	<article author="Richard Kwabena Asare" email="rasare.ppc@gmail.com" city="Tema" provst="Ashaiman Lebanon" country="Ghana" month="1" day="10" year="2015">I love this hymn, it's very inspirational, it tells us not to compromise our faith, we should just believe in God just our forefathers did. I am blessed by this song.</article>
	<article author="Sir James Ekperahwa" email="jacotesy@yahoo.com" city="Lagos" provst="South Western Nigeria" country="Nigeria" month="9" day="30" year="2014">This song is very apt for our situation in Nigeria especially in the North Eastern part where politicians have used Islam to unleash unprecedented terror on Christian and churches, yet we have not heard that the faithfuls are recanting, at the end the gate of hell will crumble, Christ reign will be established in all nations even Nigeria. Our faith is a holy faith and not a terror faith. It also reminds me of late Lady Theresa Omotesa Ekperahwa (may her soul rest in peace) who even in her dying bed held her faith in Christ firm. It is inspirational. I LOVE THE SONG.</article>

	<article author="Christopher Wendt" email="chriswendt117@gmail.com" city="Wantagh" provst="New York" country="United States" month="6" day="30" year="2014">Thanks to the folks who provided some historical perspective on the Catholic hymn from the mid-nineteenth century. However, I am still trying to find out how this wonderful hymn made it into the Lutheran Book of Worship ('The Green Book', currently used by the ELCA).</article>
	<article author="Theresa Fewtrell" email="theresafewtrell58@gmail.com" city="Manchester" provst="Lancs" country="" month="6" day="23" year="2014">When I was little and they still sang this in the Catholic Mass it would make me feel overwhelming sadness as I thought it was about my Father and the line "we will be true to thee till death" always made me cry. I have no idea why this memory has surfaced now..50 years on, my dad passed 20 years ago, but I had a strong urge to share this and where better?? I love and miss him more than I EVER would have imagined...xxx</article>
	<article author="Tony Adegbenro" email="35acregate@gmail.com" city="Liverpool." provst="England" country="United Kingdom" month="6" day="15" year="2014">Great song. It's Father's Day and I was preparing my heart for Sunday Worship when the Holy Spirit dropped this song in my heart and I was overjoyed immediately. Perfect wording that requires no change whatsoever as requested by Dave who made the last comment before mine. I don't know what his religion is but oh how we need to be true indeed till death meaning till our last breath. The tune played is the only one I know and Iove it. Please suggest other tunes if you have one. God bless.</article>
	<article author="Dave" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="5" day="16" year="2014">The piano music was very nice, but the words need a complete rewrite. I feel that someone has changed the meaning of the song. The song was originally about heavens, people trying to be good,  and be careful about their money and food, so that heaven can control the criminals. Some of the original people got injured and their families wanted to try to take care of them, while they were injured and unemployed, and were living slightly poor. But the modified words make it sound as if the originals and their children are dying.  We are trying not to die. We are trying to stay safe while heaven is controlling the criminal nations. Try not to take the words literally about true to thee till death. and worse yet, children dying to save nations. My religion has a softer interpretation, where families are helping take care of their injured family members so that they don't die. Especially people hoping to be rescued. We try to be true to heaven. But hopefully this will not involve death of heavens people. But it is a catchy tune. It needs different words.</article>
	<article author="Patricia" email="pvblair@gmail.com" city="Auckland" provst="" country="" month="4" day="23" year="2014">Shame that the tune played is not correct. But the written music on this site is the correct one. This is a Presbyterian hymn that we Catholics laid claimed to and is played at most Masses round Anzac Day.</article>
	<article author="Ian" email="iancharding@btinternet.com" city="Little Dunham" provst="Norfolk" country="" month="4" day="21" year="2014">I am a committed Anglican but went to a Catholic boarding school - this is by far my favourite hymn - it is truly wonderful - As a result of my school days I have always considered myself as an Anglo/Catholic - if that makes sense - I embrace both paths.</article>
	<article author="Adekanmi Asegun" email="pastorkanmi2003@yahoo.com" city="Boston" provst="Massachusetts" country="United States" month="1" day="19" year="2014">Great hymn... What a solemn call to contemporary Christians to retrace their steps back to the ancient pathway of absolute consecration.</article>
	<article author="J Campbell" email="jkcampbell54@btinternet.com" city="Glasgow" provst="Scotland" country="United Kingdom" month="1" day="7" year="2014">I agree Christine. I remember singing this hymn in Primary School and the tune was much more rousing.
I also remember the tune as 'Oh bread of heaven beneath this veil, though dost my very God conceal...'
Brings back great childhood memories from times when we saw the world very differently.
Sadly, religion is a diminishing force in the world, and Catholicism is one of many religions fighting for influence.
Finally, 'martyrdom' has deeply negative connotations in these days of suicide bombers. I know the contexts are often very different, but the Catholic church celebrates the likes of Thomas More as martyrs even though he was responsible for the deaths of many people of conscience in his times.
Faith of our Fathers is like a call to arms for Catholics, in my opinion not appropriate for the modern age. There's enough so-called 'religious' conflict.
Nowadays, I fell more inspired by more inclusive songs such as the Internationale, or pop songs like John Lennon's 'Imagine'.</article>
	<article author="Christine" email="christine18@tiscali.co.uk" city="Mersin" provst="IÃ§el" country="Turkey" month="10" day="31" year="2013">The tune you have given for this very old Catholic hymn ''Faith of our Fathers Living Still'' is not correct at all. 

The tune you have given is for ''O Bread of Heaven Beneath this Veil''

What has happened to the ORIGINAL TUNE please?!! I can't find it anywhere and I believe it speaks for us again at this time in the holy Church.</article>
	<article author="Dominic" email="idufeyi@yahoo.com" city="Calabar" provst="Cross River" country="Nigeria" month="10" day="2" year="2013">I woke up this morning and my spirit got connected to this song. I hummed and then sang. My heart was reminded of the faith I must keep in spite of all odds.</article>

	<article author="Bolanle" email="" city="Abuja" provst="FCT" country="Nigeria" month="8" day="3" year="2013">This is an highly inspirational song which leaves me thinking. These old missionaries were proud to showcase the level of faith displayed by their forefathers. What virtues are we in this present generation hope to leave behind, such that our own children too can proudly sing of long after we are gone? Unfortunately we are busy chasing the riches of this world, not mindful of the fact that such things are merely temporal.</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="6" day="19" year="2013">Frederick Faber felt the new religious movements that seemed so popular in his day were dangerous. He felt there was too much emphasis on the experience of the moment. After 3 years as an Anglican minister, he left that church and joined the Roman Catholic church. He appreciated the continuity with the past that he found there, and he respected the martyrs who had given their lives for Christ. But as a Roman Catholic, he missed the singing he had enjoyed as an Anglican. So he wrote hymns to fill the void. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>

	<article author="Simeon Atoza" email="satoza@outlook.com" city="London" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="4" day="17" year="2013">It is really time now for all people of whatever tribe, nation, creed etc. to return to the Faith our Fathers passed on to us from the time Christ descended into hell and conquered hell. The Apostles lived that Faith. The world today need to return to that faith.</article>

	<article author="Elizabeth" email="ea.bosworth@att.net" city="Houston" provst="TX" country="United States" month="3" day="3" year="2013">Every generation faces hardship and a choice to hold on to the hope we have in Christ and the power and comfort of His word. Faith of our Fathers describes that steadfast faith that will not grow cold. This hymn is so meaningful to me. I remember my great aunt Bess singing this hymn often while working on the farm. I wonder what hardships her life faced that she clung to it so dearly.</article>
	<article author="Benjamin" email="" city="Lagos" provst="" country="Nigeria" month="10" day="4" year="2011">Thanks for the tune of this song. I am a fundamentalist Christian and absolutely pray and believe the world can never choke the living word. Christ lives and our faith in Him must live and be shared to the dying world. It is the only cure to sin and satanism; only His word for spiritual revolution; let's share it and live by it.</article>
	<article author="Rose Costello" email="" city="Green Bay" provst="WI" country="United States" month="5" day="30" year="2011">Thank you, Mr. Wilson, for the historical background of this song. Reading the lyrics had me wondering about that. It will add special perspective when I play this soulful song on the piano for special occasions. Much obliged. If anyone has additional information about the melody, please share that, too.</article>
	<article author="Anup D'almeida" email="" city="Mumbai" provst="Maharastra" country="India" month="3" day="1" year="2011">This is a very inspirational hymn; makes me feel proud on the way early Christians went through persecutions for their faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. May we who live in today's world with so much freedom take inspiration fom them and live a life worthy of being called a true Christian. Praise Jesus!</article>
	<article author="Margaret Vaz" email="" city="Mumbai" provst="Maharashtra" country="India" month="1" day="31" year="2011">I love the lyrics, I heard it when I was young but did not understand. It is a very powerful hymn. It is awesome. I can understand to depth what Christians went through thru the ages. No Matter What, Jesus Christ Lives. Christianity will go on!! I am a Catholic and I love it!!!</article>
	<article author="Bruce A. Wilson" email="" city="Charleston" provst="WV" country="United States" month="11" day="7" year="2010">This hymn was written in celebration of the Catholic Emancipation Act, by which it became legal for the first time since the Reformation for Roman Catholics to worship openly in England. The bit about 'our father's chained in prisons dark'--nobody had gone to prison for a while just for being Catholic, but there would have been English Catholics who were old enough to have remembered stories from their childhoods of it having happened to people of the immediately preceding generation.</article>
