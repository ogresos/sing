HE woke me up this morning with this song in my heart I couldn't find it in my hymnal so I googled it. It was just so refreshing for me as I sang this song beginning my day knowing that the Holy SPIRIT leadeth me. He's our Guide, Comforter, Shield, Deliverer, Provider, Strong Tower, Redeemer and Saviour who leads us through the valley and restores our souls. If you do not yet received JESUS CHRIST as your LORD AND SAVIOR I'm inviting you to do so now that you too will have that confidence that someone is leading you through life's journey. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HELPING ME TO Find THE SONG THAT WOKE ME UP. My SOUL WAS REFRESHED.</article>

I will run to look up all verses to see what message I need to receive from the beautiful hymn. I haven't heard this hymn in 30 years. The verses are so pertinent for me today.

Most times the other side seem greener but, as faithful followers we must learn to say "though the other side seem greener but where You've kept for me is good enough for me.</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="8" day="26" year="2014">Besides pastoring several Baptist congregations, Gilmore served as a secretary to his father, the governor of New Hampshire. He was also a professor of English literature and Hebrew.
---------------------------
On March 26, 1862, after speaking on Psalm 23 he quickly wrote down this hymn and handed it to his wife, after which he thought no more about it. 3 years later, in a Baptist Church in Rochester, NY, he opened one of their hymnbooks and saw his hymn printed there. This was the first time that he knew his hymn had gained acceptance by others. This is the only hymn of his which has maintained popularity. - Songs of the Spirit by Martin
------------------------
The original last line of the song says:
Since God through Jordan leadeth me.</article>

	<article author="Daniel D Kim" email="dankim715@gmail.com" city="Worthington" provst="OH" country="" month="4" day="8" year="2014">Verses 1 &amp; 3 helped me this morning. Sometimes when I see a brother loses his job or when I see another failing in his health, I am quick to say that they should turn to the Lord. However, when I am experiencing spiritual disappointments, it is so easy for me to murmur and bemoan my state. But realizing that He leadeth us even to spiritual disappointments, job loss, health failures, etc, this makes me glad in Him and even to praise Him. "Lord, I would like to be 'content, whatever lot I see', 'whatever I do, wherever I be' because You leadeth us".</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="1" day="20" year="2013">It is so comforting that the Lord leads us.

The author of this hymn was pastor of Philadelphia's 1st Baptist Church during the Civil War. After one service, they were fellowshipping at deacon's house about the blessedness of God's leading. As others went on talking, Gilmore took out a pencil and wrote the words of this hymn, gave it to his wife, and forgot about it.
3 years later he was a pastoral candidate for a church in Rochester, NY. Since he was unfamiliar with the church's hymnal, he began leafing through it and spotted the hymn, "He Leadeth Me" - his own hymn! Without his knowledge, Mrs. Gilmore had sent the words to a Christian periodical, which had set them to music. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown and Norton.</article>
