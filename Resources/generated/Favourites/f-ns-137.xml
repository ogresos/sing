This world is worthless in our mind because in John 15:19 it says that we are not of this world. In 16:33 it says also that"IN THE WORLD YOU HAVE AFFLICTION, but TAKE COURAGE; I HAVE OVERCOME THE WORLD." We can overcome the world saints because we believe that Jesus is the Son of God in 1 John 5:5. And now we can say HALLELUJAH for such a great salvation. Amen.</article>
