Message 5 / Christ as the Slave of God and the Believers as Slaves of God and Christ Jesus in the Church Life
我愛我的恩主，不願意自由出去，
你將性命捨棄，寶血重價買我歸於你。 
我愛我的恩主，願意永遠服事你，
我心所求，緊緊跟隨不稍偏離。
我愛我的恩主，不要求自己權利，
你是我真自由，我喜樂滿溢。
我愛我的恩主，和我的妻子兒女，
我命我力我愛我心，全都歸你。
───────────────────────
哦耶穌，我的主，帶我到門框那裡，
開通我的耳朵，聽見你聲音並你命令。
哦耶穌，我的主，順服作神家奴僕，
愛中服事向你活著，一生滿足。
我愛我的恩主，不在意自己權益，
奴僕的愛與靈，來將我充溢。
我愛我的恩主，基督召會眾聖徒，
願為你們花費，完全花上自己。</article>

	<article author="Igor Savinkin" email="igor.savinkin@gmail.com" city="Riga" provst="Latvia" country="Russia" month="9" day="14" year="2014">I have very much enjoyed this hymn. "Remaining near and close to Him, this my plea." It's by our beholding and reflecting Him that we are fully in oneness with Him and our service is acceptable to Him. The love of the slave from Exo. 21:1-6 is very much the result of the most pleasant and eternally blessed living with Lord Jesus Christ in his house. As I was living in the church in Moscow for several years I did experienced the eternal love and care and pleasantness that made me to consecrate myself to Him, even to the extend of being and serving as slave to the Master. This hymn does describe my deep feeling toward Him.</article>

Such simple hymn could refresh our consecration to the Lord. Thanks for this hymn. It reminds me of my service to the Lord of Lords and the King of kings. He is now my Lord, my Master. " Lord Jesus I love You, I give myself to You afresh."</article>
