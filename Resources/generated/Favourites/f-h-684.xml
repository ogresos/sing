He is a clergy / pastor, and sings it all the time especially in funerals, to comfort the bereaved and wounded hearts.</article>
	<article author="Valerie Norberry Vanorden" email="vnorberry@gmail.com" city="Kalamazoo" provst="Mi" country="United States" month="12" day="10" year="2013">This song gives me great comfort. I was adopted and my mother was not able to take care of me because she was sick, my biological mother. My adopted family also went through trials and my adopted mom and dad divorced when I was 18. I believe God allowed sorrow in my life to bring the art out of my life. This song reminds me of a proverb which is hard to understand unless you've been there and done that: "The heart knoweth its own bitterness, and a stranger doth not intermeddleth with it's joy". In other words, when that bitter spot is finally healed, it is basically a private thing. It cannot be explained casually to a stranger.</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="8" day="30" year="2013">Irish poet Thomas Moore is best known for his ballads like "The Last Rose of Summer" and "Believe Me if All Those Endearing Young Charms." One writer called Moore "one of the strangest of all men to write hymns." The son of a Dublin grocer, Moore was educated at Trinity College in Dublin, but he could not graduate because he was Roman Catholic. After a short career in government, he devoted himself to writing and became known as the "Voice of Ireland." Many were surprised when Moore published his "Sacred Song-Duets" in 1824.
"Come, Ye Disconsolate," which was originally titled "Relief in Prayer," has undergone some revision since Moore wrote it, but the original version contained the same message. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown and Norton</article>

Oh yeah, the tune is also nice and goes along with the theme. The range of the notes from the bottom to the top of the scale mirrors the ups and downs of the person's experience or at least his/her emotional reaction to trials...It rocks. :)

I have to admit it is hard to negotiate the changes from the upper to lower range of notes. I was just trying it.

This is a song that would be good to sing sometimes where the comfort of the saints or some seeking visitors is a theme. But you need to practice it a few times. Also it needs some saints who have trained voices who can help to carry it.</article>
