I have put my food cravings before God. I need to put God as my first priority, to fill my life, my soul with Him. I have sung this song many times but never in this context. Anyone who has a craving other than God, read this and see if it doesn't speak to you! God can and will feed me and fill me til I want nothing else if I will only let Him. I will let Him!!</article>

	<article author="Pastor Jim" email="pastorjimgreystone@bellsouth.net" city="Mobile" provst="AL" country="United States" month="10" day="16" year="2014">Thank you, Vee, for your encouraging and uplifting comments. I completely agree. And to Leslie--better start checking the Word of God instead of Calvin. Your comments on verse 3 of this song show you aren't following the Bible but hyper-Calvinism. Whosoever will may come--as many as receive Him, to them He gives the power (right or privilege) to become the children of God. Leslie, you are right--"The Lord is under no obligation to 'save me' simply because I 'humbly' ask Him to." But He will--because He has offered by grace to saved those who call upon the name of the Lord upon believing that Jesus Christ is their personal payment for their sins. We must never add nor take away what God has said in His Word--ESPECIALLY about His offer of salvation by grace through faith.</article>
	<article author="Vee" email="venstew@gmail.com" city="London" provst="" country="" month="9" day="26" year="2014">In reply to Leslie, why do you make such disturbing comments about a song which is simply trying to minister and tell "the sinner" how to get to God? In 2 Chronicles 7:14 says "if my people who are called by my name will HUMBLE themselves and PRAY........ I know there are more requirements, but this is a song to encourage you to get to know God, not a Bible study moment. How did you get from commenting on the lyrics of a song to spouting what looks like condemnation.
Simply listening to the words with a contrite heart will do, follow the instructions, then God and the Holy Spirit will do the rest.</article>

	<article author="Leslie" email="mcmikeleslie@speakeasy.net" city="" provst="" country="" month="5" day="10" year="2014">The first two verses are great. They are a prayer. The last verse is simply NOT TRUE, and very deceptive. The Lord is under no obligation to "save me" simply because I "humbly" ask him to. The first verse shows the picture of TRUE conversion. "I heard my Savior speaking, 'Draw from the well that never will run dry.'" The Lord is the initiator, 'lest any man boast.' Jesus "must needs go through Samaria" because the Lord WILL save the elect. This event demonstrates that it matters not who you are, or where you are, if you are God's chosen, His 'elect,' He WILL come and get you. Many think they are 'saved' who are not. Jesus said, "Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life: and FEW there be, that find it." Conversely, He said, "WIDE is the gate, and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction: and MANY there be, which go in thereat." Read it in context (Mt. 7:13-27) may the Spirit open to you the fact that most 'professing Christians' are goats and do not know it: "there is no fear of God before their eyes." (Rom. 3:18.) For excellent reading on this subject I strongly recommend two books: "Seeking God: Jonathan Edwards' Evangelism Contrasted with Modern Methodologies," and "Knowing the Heart: Jonathan Edwards on True and False Conversion."</article>
