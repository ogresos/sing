What I never could do God is doing in me
By saying Amen to His Word.
Hymns, #1219

What we are not able to do ourselves God desires to do in us. For example, a husband should say to the Lord, 'Lord, You ask me to love my wife. Lord, I love You, but I must tell You that I cannot love my wife.' Then the Lord will say, 'Right, you can't love your wife, but I will love her through you. What you cannot do, I will do in you.' Concerning the commandments to love the brothers and to love our neighbor as ourselves, we should also say, 'Lord, I love You, but I must be honest with You. I cannot love the brothers, and I cannot love others as myself. I have many neighbors and relatives, but I simply am not able to love them. Lord, I love You and I love Your Word, but I simply am not able to love them. Lord, I love You and I love Your Word, but I cannot love other people.' Once again the Lord will tell us that what we are not able to do He will do from within us. This is God's economy both in the Old Testament and in the New.
