	<article author="Patricia" email="patricialyon@hypercon.net" city="Maybrook" provst="New York" country="United States" month="3" day="26" year="2016">One Easter about 50 years ago my pastor, Rev. Beatrice Dodge, had us children sing this as a special. Today, almost 50 years later to the day I thought of the words. Thank God for the Internet. God bless everyone who had a part in uplifting my heart in words, music, and comments. God is so good; what must Heaven be like? Eternal joy, peace, celebration, glory, life, fellowship, ...everything from the heart of love of God. I hope all who read this will know and experience that Jesus made it all possible for those who have made the choice for returning the love in living for God here, that we might live with God there. God be all you need for today and every day!</article>

Now I find there is no need to "doctor" the music, for the words and music already fit perfectly together to make a complete message in song! "Hallelujah! what a Savior! who can take a poor lost sinner, lift him from the miry clay and set him free; I will ever tell the story shouting glory, glory, glory, hallelujah! Jesus ransomed me."
Oh! that others may come to know the living God (John 1:12-13).
My friend, if you have not yet had this experience, then beg God to enable you by his Spirit to receive Christ Jesus the LORD! (Ruler, King or Governor over you Romans 10:13). Ask Him to send you a preacher who knows The Way (Rom.10:14-15).</article>

I have no problem with new songs with new lyrics and melodies, we sing them at our church all the time. There are plenty of spirit filled composers of words and music these days. While I won't spend much time criticizing the modern accompaniment I prefer the traditional, mainly without out the drums and electronic amplification. I was having my devotions this morning and my 10 month old son walked over, so I launched into some praise songs as a way of including him and teaching him about Jesus at his young age. The above is one among others that came to mind. I agree that there's no need to change the words to suit modern sensibilities, if people are offended by words like "vile" it just proves the words are true. What are going to do about how Paul describes every one of us in Romans 1?</article>
	<article author="Ann Cameron" email="bedsonbally@gmail.com" city="Brisbane" provst="Queensland" country="Australia" month="12" day="9" year="2015">Recently, when this beautiful old hymn was announced in church - Keperra Baptist - a thrill ran through me, a thrill of expectation of being able to sing with all my might these words that have meant so much to me since childhood. Alas! The tune was a travesty! One you couldn't even take home in a basket. I'm sure not even the song leader could sing it without instruments after the service.
Why, oh why are these old hymn tunes changed? For better I can accept, but for worse? Give us the first few words and we "oldies" can sing it for you without music - don't need guitars and drums!
Worse still is when the words are altered. Last Sunday we sang "To God be the glory, great things he has done" and the words were changed from "The vilest offender who truly believes," to I suppose a much more politically acceptable phrase - "And every offender who truly believes." Is Jesus no longer able to save the vilest or have we somehow improved our condition?
Would we change the work of Shakespeare or Wordsworth or even Banjo Patterson for that matter? Then why do we insult the writers of hymns by altering their words as though we now know better? Musical knowledge is more widely available today as never before, but we stoop to nursery rhyme style tunes with accompanying limericks.
Thank God for the songs on which I was raised, they are a blessing to recall and sing in those moments of discouragement, despair and difficulties, but also to eloquently praise and glorify my King, the Lord Jesus Christ.</article>

How nice the internet helped me find this delightful old hymn. Sang it at church many times as a girl. How I miss the hymns...alas! Times change and so has church music. I guess I'm a relic of the past, but the old hymns taught the Bible as well as the pastor did.</article>

I do not like the modern version by ''Casting Crowns'' They should not be allowed to change the Chapman/Marsh original song! I wonder if copyright violations were made?</article>

But I also love and am moved by many, many of the modern worship songs! God is still inspiring His people to put Biblical truth to music for a new generation of worshippers and I am grateful for the many dedicated young musicians who are using their talents for His glory in the area of church music, my own sons and daughter-in-law included in that number. There is room for the old and the new, so long as the underlying desire is to bring praise to the Lord and win others for His Kingdom.</article>
	<article author="Paul Williams" email="pjw1949@comcast.net" city="Stockton" provst="California" country="United States" month="2" day="11" year="2014">This is my mother's favorite hymn. The lyrics are rich with theology and are heart warming. My favorite song is "And Can It Be That I should gain", another hymn that is rich in theology and describes the awe felt by all believers. Best Christmas carol is 'Hark the Harold Angels Sing'. It is a pity that these wonderful hymns are being abandoned for mindless praise chorus.</article>

	<article author="Erin Ransom" email="eransom28@gmail.com" city="Fairborn" provst="Ohio" country="United States" month="7" day="14" year="2013">I do not feel that "modernizing" these songs takes away from the message in any way shape or form. I grew up in a hymn singing church where this song was sung, but I did not recognize the words to this hymn when I heard it as Casting Crown's O Glorious Day! I find the newer version to be as another poster commented a beautiful picture of the redeeming love of Christ Jesus. The reason these songs are modernized, in my opinion, is because the truth of them still rings true, but the style or sound of the music isn't as pleasing to a young year. When the same song can be put to music that moves the modern day listener I think a beautiful piece of art, that is pleasing to God, has taken shape.</article>

	<article author="Kay Robnson" email="" city="Colfax" provst="TX" country="United States" month="4" day="8" year="2012">I love this song, old or new version. The writer of the lyrics did not write the music. I like to picture the writers of old getting to take a peek from heaven and hearing their original lyrics being sung to a brand new tune and asking what power point is as they see their words they penned long ago still ringing the truth decades later. No song tells the gospel message from start to finish like this one. No beauty is lost in singing it old style or new. We sang it this morning on Easter and people that had never heard the old version (since they had become Christians recently) were singing to the Lord at the top of their lungs. I bet the writer of this song J Wilbur Chapman got to see!</article>

	<article author="Steve" email="" city="" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="9" day="8" year="2008">It's an old favourite, and there is much to praise it for.
However I've recently looked again at Rm. 4:25. The first dia   accusative case must mean 'because of our sins', not 'to achieve our sins'. If Gk. dia accusative case carries the same meaning both times (this is moot), then Paul's thought was that his rising combined with his death to justify us, but rather that his rising showed us that justification had now been made available by his death. The ISV carries this proof of achievement idea, though I still suspect the song is right.</article>
	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="25" year="2008">In this gospel campaign we will also use Hymns, #987, which is an excellent gospel hymn written by the American evangelist J. Wilbur Chapman. In Chapman's days, the prevailing theology was the theology taught by the modernists. The modernists said that the Lord Jesus was not God, that His death had not been for redemption, and that He had not been resurrected. Therefore, Chapman purposely wrote this hymn of five verses. The first verse is on the birth of the Lord Jesus, the second verse is on His death, the third verse is on His burial, the fourth verse is on His resurrection, and the fifth verse is on His coming back. This hymn not only has a dignified tune, but its chorus is also particularly well written, pointing out the subject matter of all five verses. The chorus says, "Living, He loved me; dying, He saved me; / Buried, He carried my sins far away; / Rising, He justified freely forever: / One day He's coming—O glorious day!" The content of this hymn is proper and rich, and the tune is dignified.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="24" year="2008">The hymn we just sang, hymn 987, was written at the beginning of this century. It was written by an American brother. At that time, the liberal theology was flourishing, which said that the Bible is not the word of God, that miracles are not real, and that the resurrection of Jesus was merely a resurrection of His ideas. It also said that there are neither angels nor demons.
...
This hymn has five verses. The first verse speaks of Jesus' incarnation. The second tells of His crucifixion. The third verse speaks of His burial, the fourth, of His resurrection, and the fifth, of His second coming. The last phrase of the fifth verse says, "This Jesus is mine!" What the author was saying at the end was "This is my Jesus! My Jesus is not the Jesus that you modernists claim to know. My Jesus was incarnated because He loved me. He was crucified to save me and buried to take my sins far away. He rose to justify me freely forever, and one day He is coming back to receive me."
