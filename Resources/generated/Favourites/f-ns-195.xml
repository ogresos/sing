1. Breath by breath we breathe the Lord. 
Amen! Amen!
Breath by breath He quickens us. 
Amen! Amen!
Yes, He breathes out and we breathe in,
And deeply flows His life within,
For we’ve all learned how to
deeply breathe the Lord.
 
2. John 3:8  speaks of the air
without, without;
The wind blows where it wills, it wills,
without, without.
We cannot tell from where it comes,
We cannot tell to where it runs —
So is everyone who’s of the Spirit born.
 
3. John 20:22  speaks of
the Air within.
Jesus breathed the Breath of Life
from Him, from Him!
He only asks us to receive —
’Tis not to think but only breathe —
And it’s by this breath that we experience life!
 
4. Now wherever we may be
there’s Air, there’s Air!
It surrounds, envelops us —
it’s everywhere!
Available, so rich and free
That we might live abundantly —
So brothers, sisters, breathe the breath of life.
 
5. Just by calling on His name:
O Lord! O Lord!
Christ becomes the breath to us:
O Lord! O Lord!
We breathe His name from deep within
And breathe until we’re filled with Him,
And what a breath this Jesus is to us!</article>

We used to sing it to the tune of, "Riding through the snow, in a one horse open sleigh, ov'r the fields we go, laughing all the way...."
Anyway, it's a wonderful song and I love the words. There is another song like it, "Breath by breath we breathe the Lord, amen, amen......................................... It can be found in the Spokane Supplement
May the Lord bless you all.</article>
