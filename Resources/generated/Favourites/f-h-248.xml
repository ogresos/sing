Now we can experience this life giving flow, not by struggling, but as the hymn says
"Call for the Spirit, whisper soft and low, speak to the Rock, bid the waters flow"
He is the Rock. Amen.</article>
	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="24" year="2008">The truth is that Christ was smitten and cleft on the cross once for all. There is no need for Him to be smitten again. We need to realize the accomplished fact that Christ was smitten on the cross two thousand years ago. Instead of smiting Him again, we just need to speak to Him. When we speak to Him, He will give us the living water. Hymn #248 (see Hymns) is very good in this point:
...
The more you sing this hymn, the more you will fall in love with it. Christ has already been crucified and riven for us. We do not need to smite Him, but we need to call on Him, to speak to Him, to bid Him to give us the living water.
