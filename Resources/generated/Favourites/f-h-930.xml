I always shed tears. The song is very touching. I pray all that sing this song will go out for soul winning. You will not have rest until you win souls for the Master Jesus, amen.
If Jesus tarries His coming, we shall meet again.

	<article author="Adefi, Adegbola Tolu" email="tolujudes@gmail.com" city="Ile Ife" provst="Osun/Nigeria" country="Nigeria" month="1" day="10" year="2016">I learnt this song while in High School back in the 1990s. The story behind its composition was narrated to us then. This morning, I am slated for a Gideon International message in a local church in Ipetumode near Ile-Ife, Osun State, Nigeria. I am motivated to use the story behind the song and the words of the hymn to encourage the congregation to give their service to Christ while they still may. I had to refresh my memory of the story behind the song and I searched for it. Incidentally, I came across this comment section and decided to drop this comment. Let us all give of our best and serve our Lord while we still may.</article>

As the gospel is ever new so this song will remain new. Each time I preach about song winning and witnessing for Christ, I like ending it with this song. This should be the heart cry of every Christian know that we are called for this purpose. He chose us to bear fruit and that our fruit should remain. Song inspires every Christian. I thank God for the composer and the inspiration.</article>

There is no way you listen to this hymn and it won't bring tears to your face. We need to do the work of God with passion and the whole of ourselves.

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="11" day="24" year="2014">Charles Luther was initially a journalist before becoming an evangelist and eventually a Baptist minister. He wrote about 25 hymn texts. - Songs of the Spirit by Martin
Luther heard Rev. A. G. Upham tell the story of a young man who was about to die. He’d only been a Christian for a month, and was sad because he’d had so little time to serve the Lord. He said, “I am not afraid to die; Jesus saves me now. But must I go empty handed?” This incident prompted the writing of the song; Stebbins wrote the music when Luther gave him the words. The complete song was first published in Gospel Hymns No. 3, 1878. - hymntime</article>

	<article author="Ruth &amp; Nelson Pallister" email="" city="Orpington Nr London" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="8" day="19" year="2012">In Alexander's Revival Hymns (No 53) there is a note to the following effect: "After a month of Christian life, nearly all of it passed upon a sick bed, a young man, nearly 30 years of age, lay dying. Suddenly a look of sadness crossed his face, and to the query of a friend he exclaimed: "No, I am not afraid; Jesus saves me now! But Oh must I go - and empty handed?" 

I wonder how many lives have been touched by this hymn, so that he did not in fact go into the presence of Jesus empty handed.</article>

	<article author="Winifred" email="" city="Tema" provst="" country="Ghana" month="9" day="24" year="2010">I am comforted in this hymn to realize that in all our Christian living as children, begotten of God in His life, only one thing is needful-our begetting many more to become sons of God through the preaching of the genuine gospel. I am comforted that not many things the Lord requires of us, but this He does, that we preach the gospel and bear many fruits and that our fruit should remain, even until He comes. This releases us from all the world offers to us. May the Lord grant us grace to enjoy Him and be released from the world and all its distractions to focus on the main thing-bearing much fruit. Amen.</article>

	<article author="Josephine" email="" city="" provst="" country="Malaysia" month="10" day="17" year="2006">This is the thought of the heart when my dear Redeemer thus to meet : must I go, and empty-handed, not one day of service give Him, and no trophy to lay at his feet...what type of feeling would that be?!

Again, in the chorus : Must I go, and empty-handed? M-U-S-T I meet?...my Savior so. It must be because not one soul, with which to greet our dearest Savior.

"For my Savior" saves me NOW, so I do not shrink nor falter at death. How comforting! But, the present mind that clouded the writer's brow is this : How to meet him? Charles asked within himself a very down-to-earth question, that is, but of the thought of meeting my Savior empty-handed! How embarassing!

Charles Carroll Luther recalled the moments that he experienced as a sinner as : wasted sinning years at this moment. He cannot help but to recall them now. His decision was to give them to His will and learned to bow and gladly bow at my Savior.

After he has been glad with the Savior's will, it is saith in the final stanza : Arise! Be earnest! O ye saints, up and work while yet 'tis day. Strive for souls!...before the night of death overtake thee, while still you may. Hallelujah!!!</article>
	<article author="Clay Wright" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="10" day="30" year="2005">This song reminds me of that part in the book written by brother Witness Lee "The All-Inclusive Christ". In chapter 15, it speaks of the Feast of Tabernacles and the Passover, when the Israelites were told to come, but in no means with their hands empty. What the Lord has revealed to me through the ministry is that we MUST enjoy the Lord daily, take Him as our supply, and come to the meetings. The best portion is for the Lord Himself, and the other portion is for you and the other saints. Therefore, feed richly on Christ daily. Praise the Lord Jesus Christ!</article>

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="8" day="25" year="2009">We must remember that one day we will all stand before the Lord. How will we give an account of ourselves, if our hands are empty? Hymns, #930 says, "'Must I go and empty-handed,' / Thus my dear Redeemer meet? / Not one day of service give Him, / Lay no trophy at His feet?" This hymn gives a vivid description of how pricked our hearts should feel. We should not wait for others to ask whether our friends and relatives are saved. I am afraid that when God asks us, even the angels will condemn us. This understanding will change our living. In the past we had our friends and relatives over for dinner and politely laughed and conversed with them, but we never preached the gospel to them. How can we repay our debt of the gospel to them?

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="25" year="2008">The story behind the writing of this hymn is very touching. A number of years ago, a certain saint was dying and was full of regret for not having brought anyone to the Lord. A servant of the Lord told this saint that he would write a hymn that would help others in the coming years to rise up to take the time while they are still living to save sinners. The matter of saving sinners is something which all of us need to seriously consider. If we were to go to meet the Lord this very day, what would our condition be related to this matter?

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="25" year="2008">This hymn was written long ago in America by Charles C. Luther. It was translated into Chinese at an early date and was widely sung among Chinese Christians. The story behind this hymn concerns an American sister who lived an ordinary Christian life. While she was on her deathbed, she suddenly felt that she had failed the Lord and was ashamed to meet Him because she had not led one person to Him in her lifetime. Therefore, she was exceedingly sorrowful. Her pastor, who was Charles C. Luther, not knowing how to comfort her, wrote this hymn to express her sentiments. When I was young, every time I attended a gospel revival meeting, we would sing this hymn. The tune can easily arouse one's spirit. Even though the original Chinese translation was poor, each time after we sang the hymn, there would always be people walking up to the front in tears and consecrating themselves for the gospel.

Later when I was compiling our hymnal, I spent much time considering whether this particular hymn is suitable to be included. Because our emphasis has always been on such high topics as the Spirit, life, Christ, and the church, I felt that the content and thought of this hymn were rather ordinary and therefore did not deserve to be included. However, because I had obtained a deep impression from this hymn, I truly liked it and could not forget it. Moreover, there is something special about the tune that can easily stir up the believer's spirit for gospel preaching. Therefore, I decided to do my best to improve the translation and to include it in the hymnal.

This hymn says that when a believer dies and goes to meet the Lord, he should not be empty-handed but should offer some trophies to Him. We preach the gospel not in fear of death but because we do not want to meet the Lord empty-handed. That we are saved is not a problem, but we still need to live an overcoming life that we may have trophies to offer to the Lord. Paul said that the believers whom he led to salvation were his hope, joy, and crown of boasting before the Lord (1 Thes. 2:19-20). If when you meet the Lord, you see that everyone else is bringing a herd of lambs and you alone are empty-handed, you will feel sad and ashamed. However, if you also bring with you a good number of lambs, your feeling and joy will be indescribable.

According to this hymn, while we believers are alive, it is day, and when we die, we enter into the dark night, that is, the night of death (stanza 4). We must work while it is day, for when night comes, no one can work (John 9:4). Therefore, while it is still day, before the night falls, we should work actively to save many souls that we may bring with us to offer to the Lord. Although the spiritual meaning of this hymn is not very deep, it has its value in practicality.
