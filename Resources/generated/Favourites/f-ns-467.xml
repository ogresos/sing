In our daily living, we tend to complicate things, but really, all He wants us to do is to open up to Him so He can enter into our hearts! We are weak, but we can take Christ as our strength to overcome the flesh. Our Lord Jesus Christ is the light that always shine in the darkness, praise the Lord for His faithfulness!!</article>
