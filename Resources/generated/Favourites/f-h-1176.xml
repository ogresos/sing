What is the Holy Spirit doing today? He is manifesting the resurrection power of Christ through the church. All the problems are over now. The Lord said that the gates of Hades cannot prevail against the church. Personally, I believe that the gates here refer to all the gates of Hades. They are all open to the church, and they cannot prevail against the church because Hades represents death, and the church represents resurrection. This is the reason the church is victorious. Whether or not the Lord has a way on earth today is not a matter of changing our behavior or knowing some truth. Some must be ready to pay the price to know resurrection, to know the Holy Spirit, and to know the church.When we know these things, the church will have a glorious testimony.
