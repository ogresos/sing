	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="9" year="2010">We need to understand that the emphasis of Hymns, #251 is not only on the river of water of life proceeding out of the throne, as seen in Revelation 22, but even more on the rivers of living water flowing out of us, as recorded in John's Gospel. John 7:38 says, "He who believes into Me.. .out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water." According to the Greek text, rivers in this verse is plural. Therefore, it is correct for Hymns, #251 to use rivers (plural). The river in Revelation 22 is the river that proceeds from the throne, and it is one river, whereas the rivers in John 7 are rivers that flow out of us, and they are many rivers.
