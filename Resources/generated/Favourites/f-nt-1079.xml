Years ago I wept my heart through all the four stanzas sung to the blessed old tune. I had arrived late at my church's weekly Monday Bible study. The treacherous Lagos traffic did me in. Meanwhile I had been mourning my confinement to my secular employment in a finance company that paid fine salary but sucked all time and strength from me. I knew God had called me but I couldn't leave because of a pending fraud case in which I was my company's star witness.
Barely two minutes after I stepped into church and joined the proceedings the choir stepped out and struck this song. My heart and head exploded in waves of anguish. Every word of the song and the heavenly presence were like a thousand jabs on my soul. 
The choir must have prayed much. And then, the old tune...(Please, I will have nothing of the often light-hearted "new tune").
The joy is that I found my release months later. That was 1990. I'm still joyfully engaged in my Saviour's service today. Yesterday, the soloist sang this song and brought back old memories...
Apologies for my rather long comment.</article>

Lord, may we not live a single day without You!</article>
	<article author="Emmanuel Awuah Pilgrim" email="the4pilgrims@yahoo.co.uk" city="Kumasi" provst="Ashanti Region" country="Ghana" month="3" day="6" year="2016">I really appreciate how some of our lovely hymns have been given new tunes. My choir sang 'If I Gained the World' today at church. The flavor was so enthusing and refreshing. I had my first degree in music. I do compositions, record them on CDs and they've been very inspirational to the body of Christ. Can I pick some of your new tunes and record them at the studio to bless some souls? Will be ready for any terms and conditions. Many thanks</article>

This song really echoes song 600 "My God, my Portion and my Love" in the hymnal. Let others grasp in ALL the shore, but just grant me the visits of Your grace, and I would desire no more. Sweet song that reminds me of the Lord's love and mercy :) Lord we give You our whole being to love You!</article>
	<article author="Anon." email="eunicegarcia76@gmail.com" city="" provst="" country="" month="10" day="24" year="2014">I had a recent experience that led me to this point.... I just consecrate my whole being, life, future, family, and even going on in Your recovery to You dear Lord for the preparation of Your Bride!!!
He takes care of all our needs. I will not boast or brag but as I put the Lord first there is a huge blessing. My deep consideration is that I have all I need because I/we have the Lord and He is in fact all we need. Only He can satisfy eternally. This hymn reminds me that I am not for this world with all of its vain pursuits and attractions. I've been caught and am constrained through the most lovely One!!! Lord Jesus I do love You my dear Master, Husband, Friend, God, my all in all.... Amen!!!</article>

Old or new, I don't like this new version which sounds nothing like the original. What's wrong with the old version that someone has to update it to some contemporary stuff. The old beauty was in the old song.</article>

If I gained the world but lost my Savior is rather an endless tragedy that can happen to our world. What can a man give in exchange for his soul.</article>
	<article author="Believer In Christ" email="" city="" provst="Florida" country="United States" month="4" day="13" year="2011">This song really touched the depths of my hardened heart. I was at the point of questioning whether I could continue my pursuit of the Lord, hopeless and disillusioned by everything the world had to offer. I broke down in tears upon hearing the song and applying the words to my own situation. I realize that God has a plan and the world is just a distraction, having the potential to hinder your spiritual growth. Praise Him for allowing us to be humbled and brought back to Him!</article>

I may change in everything Lord but I never change in Loving YOU.</article>

O the joy of having all in Jesus!
What a balm the broken heart to heal!
Ne'er a sin so great, but He'll forgive it,
Nor a sorrow that He does not feel!
If I have but Jesus, only Jesus,
Nothing else in all the world beside—
O then everything is mine in Jesus;
For my needs and more He will provide.</article>

I am 14 yrs. old and I remember listening to this hymn in the 6th grade conference. And I remember I wanted to cry because I have taken the Lord for granted and at times, I still do. But praise the Lord He is in us! Praise the Lord He's by our side.... Lord through big or small I need You! 

I consecrate myself to You!
Gain my heart, Lord.
Use me to build up Your church and Body!
Help me be a grace finder.
Help me be an ark builder.
Help me be an age turner!
I fully open to You Lord! 
My heart is an open door and I'd like You to come inside!</article>

The gospels remind me that we cannot serve the two master. I would rather choose the Lord because everything in world is temporal, refuse, dung, and are just vanity.

In this way we are being preserved by Christ Jesus!! Oh Hallelujah!!</article>

	<article author="Maisha Parkar" email="" city="Austin" provst="Texas" country="US" month="3" day="14" year="2008">Wow...what a song.  It was very timely to hear it just now. I had never heard it before.  I was distracted by many things...but now I have spontaneously been turned to look at Christ.  Yes...It would be an excellent song to pray everyday.  May the Lord have mercy on all of us to appreciate all that He has done for us.  And that spinning our wheels to do this and to do that is not the goal...but Christ gaining us inwardly is.  Oh Lord, forgive me for all the time I wasted today and have mercy on me to redeem the time lost.  There is no other joy greater than You.</article>

This hymn really touched me &amp; really reminded me that all things are just vanity if it is not of God! Often we are occupied with other things and our first love is no longer for the Lord.

I really enjoyed this hymn because as a young person, you still have a lot of things to go through and experience. There's so much things happening around us. At times, you are so busy with your things, it ends up that we don't really enjoy the Lord. But Hallelujah! This song was such a reminder for me! Even if I gained everything in the world but lost the Savior, there is no meaning in our lives! This hymn should be a daily reminder to us! We need to live by the Lord each and every day! He is all in all!</article>

	<article author="Ryan Lin" email="" city="Toronto" provst="ON" country="Canada" month="9" day="8" year="2002">I like this song because throughout my experience, I realize that nothing in this world is more worthy than our Lord, Jesus Christ. He can satisfy our every need. Also through out my experience, I notice that it is not worthy to gain the world, but lost the Savior. No matter what we do in this world. They all end up with an empty feeling inside us. Only Christ can satisfy this hunger. Once we receive Christ as our Savior, it all leads to the satisfaction, joyful, sweet feeling.</article>
