	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="10" day="12" year="2015">"I've heard this hymn called the most inspiring and triumphant hymn in the English language. I've heard it called simply the finest hymn. Personally, I have too many favorites to start passing out blue ribbons, but this certainly is one of the great ones. It's very melodic and you'll often hear it done by fine choirs. It's a hymn that hails the power of Jehovah: ... One realizes the power of God and shouts and sings about it, showing a fear of the Lord - not a fear in the sense of being frightened, but a realization that this power is here and there is none greater." - Tennessee Ernie Ford</article>

It can really help small congregations that cannot afford to hire a pianist much more even to buy a piano or an electric organ. May God continue to bless this ministry.</article>
