We need a consistent morning revival EVERY MORNING!! And the secret to waking up early lies in Phil 2:13, "For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure." To experience grace, or to even rise up early, we must humble ourselves before The Lord, not trusting in our own strength but trust in Christ!</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="7" day="19" year="2014">Charlotte Elliot was born in Clapham, England. As a young person, she lived a carefree life enjoying popularity as a portrait artist and writer of humorous verse. At the age of 30, her health began to fail. In 1822 at the age of 33, she received the Lord through the help of a Swiss evangelist doctor. After inquiring of the doctor how she might find Christ, he replied: "Dear Charlotte cut the cable. You must come to Christ just as you are." Even though she lived to 82, she never regained her health. "Just as I am," her best known hymn, was written 14 years after her conversion. It was written at a time when she felt useless due to her ill health. In her despondency, the words of the doctor came back to her. ...
It is said that after her death more than 1000 letters were found among her papers, expressing gratitude for this hymn and the effect it had on people's lives. She wrote approximately 150 hymns and is considered one of the finest English women hymn writers. - Songs of the Spirit by Martin</article>

	<article author="Emily" email="" city="" provst="" country="UK" month="5" day="1" year="2007">This song is so beautiful, and so true. God's rally been showing me how I have to come just as I am recently. No matter how well I know the scriptures, how well I serve Him, how often I go to church or worship - in the end all I can do is come just as I am, the biggest conflict of all is within. I pray that this song touches the lives of many others - as it has the power to do (through Christ). I was talking to my mum the other day and I told her I'd found this new song which I loved, and it turned out it was one of her favourites, and she loved it too! Amazing! I pray it might continue to be true for me and that through Christ's power and in the Holy Spirit, I might overcome the stuff I'm going through at the moment, and learn to come to Jesus trusting in His promises alone.</article>
	<article author="Cicy Zhao" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="12" day="16" year="2006">Just as I am, Jesus accepts me. This hymn makes me cry, even for such a sinner like me, Jesus seeks me through and pays His love and faith. I used to be so sinful and fallen, but He still waited and prayed for me for such a long time! He even chose me in the eternal past.
Everytime when I am down or lost in the world, I will always sing the hymn. Because I know that even the whole world has rejected and disappointed me, I can still find peace, love and hope in Jesus Christ; even my life is totally messed up, I still have trust in Jesus, for I have been kept in His promise.</article>

Aleluya that this song, Just as I am, reminds me that in my human spirit I am able to have fellowship with the Lord, no matter what, when, how, where.

There was a tent meeting with the service about to close. Being curious I went in to see what was happening and as I entered, the folks began to sing this song. The first verse was all I needed and I walked up to the altar and wept. Since then I never went back to old ways but I have JESUS. I am now 47 yrs. LOVE &amp; BLESSINGS, Chaykhinah.</article>
	<article author="Hymnal.net" city="" provst="" country="" month="2" day="5" year="2013">God is Spirit; hence, our contacting and absorbing Him do not depend on our words. Some people utter many words when they pray, but their words are like sounding brass or clanging cymbals; they do not have much value before God. We may not say anything when we come to God, but our whole being, including our heart, should face God. While we look to God, we may sigh and confess that we are incompetent, weak, unable to rise, unpresentable, and thirsty and that we lack words for the gospel and are not inclined to fellowship with the saints. We should lay our inner condition before God and even tell Him that we are short in every matter. No matter what our inner condition is, we should bring it to God. There is a hymn that says, "Just as I am" (Hymns, #1048). This means that we should come to God just as we are without trying to improve or change our condition. Our attitude when we come to God should be to come just as we are.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="20" year="2008">I like the song we sang today. It says, "Just as I am...I come! I come!" [Hymns, #1048]. I have told you before that this hymn was written by a woman in her twenties. She said that she had the sense of sin since she was very young. She wondered how a person like herself could face God. To her this was impossible. She visited many churches and talked with many pastors. She asked them questions and tried to find out from them how she could be saved. This went on for seven or eight years. Many told her that she had to do better before she could believe in Jesus. Others told her that she should pray more and study the Bible more. Still others told her to do good and perform noble deeds, or to do this or do that before she could believe in the Lord Jesus and be saved. As time went by, she found herself worse than before. In the end, she met an old preacher. She asked the old man what she must do before she could be saved. The old man put his hand on her back and said, "Go to God just as you are." She jumped up and asked, "Do I not have to do better, make more progress, and improve more before I can believe in the Lord Jesus?" The old man said, "There is no such need. You can come just as you are." On that day, she became clear and realized that she could come to the Lord just as she was.

God knows that we are sick. This is why He sent us the Doctor. Friends, have you ever been sick? Suppose I have a fever of one hundred five degrees. If I ask the doctor to come, will he say that he will come when the temperature drops to one hundred three? The sicker I am, the faster the doctor will come. If a person's temperature is ninety-eight degrees, the doctor may say that since it is only ninety-eight degrees, there is no need to go. The more serious your illness is, the faster the doctor will come. The woman admitted that she was a sick person and that Jesus Christ is the Physician from God who came to heal her. Not long after she returned home, she wrote this hymn: "Just as I am...I come! I come!"
