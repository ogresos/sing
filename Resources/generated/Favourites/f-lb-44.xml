Brother Higashi, who is now with the Lord he loves, penned this truly. Lord Jesus, thank You for Your work on the cross, and Your work in us. Thank You that You are the ever-faithful one, without whom we would be totally incapable of love.  We are for You, because You claimed us for Your own.  May we all know You so deeply, and love You so truly.</article>
