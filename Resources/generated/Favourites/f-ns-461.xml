In Song of Songs, whenever we feel that the Lord's presence is gone like what was experienced by the seeking one, what we need to do is just to tell others about our Beloved, the more we tell them about Him, the more we will realize that the Lord was never been gone, He is just in His garden, feeding His flocks... Hallelujah! the Lord will never leave us, He will always be with us from this very day, until the consummation of this age.</article>
