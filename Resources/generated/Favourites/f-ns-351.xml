Every time I sing it I cannot help falling deeper in love with Him! This hymn is so refreshing to my spirit and helps me to give my entire being to Him whenever I sing it. "Jesus Lord my best love Thou art"! Oh there is truly no one else as lovely and charming as He! "Oh Lord Jesus how I love thee"! When we see His beauty, we realize that we are nothing &amp; that He is everything! All that we wanted before Him is vanity &amp; a waste of time. Only this precious One is worthy of all our time, being, &amp; love. Oh may we even love Him back with His love that He has poured into us that His heart may be satisfied!</article>

We need to love Him. It is not enough to believe in the Lord Jesus. To believe is to receive, but to love is to enjoy what we have received. We must take His desires as our desires. We must take His will as our will. We must take His intention as our intention.To love Him as a Person, we must take His personality. We must learn to love the Lord faithfully! :)</article>

Sólo Tuyo es mi corazón,
Nada se compara a Ti en verdad,
Tan hermoso y bello Senor.
Cuando escucho el susurrar
De Tu hablar en mi corazón.
Todo amor y búsqueda queda atrás,
Mis jactancias, Qué vanas son!

Qué tan dulce en este universo es?
Qué tan bello en la tierra como Tu?
Eres digno Tu de todo mi amor,
Muy profundo, Te amo Jesús.
No seré igual, no me engañare,
Ni atrapado en mi mundo estaré,
Eres el mejor y único amor
Tu amor profundo en mi ser.

Mi Jesús, mi mejor amor, 
Aunque es terco mi corazón,
Hazme esclavo hoy de Tu gran amor
Para amarte, yo Te deseo.
Aunque aveces Te rechaze,
Tu mirar siempre seguiré;
Complacerte es mi mayor placer,
Tu amor traspasa mi ser.

Mi Jesús, Te adoro Senor. 
No me apartaré más de Ti.
Tu sonriente faz no se aleje de mi,
Tu presencia deseo seguir.
Hoy Te ofrezco mi corazon,
Eres Tu mi satisfaccion;
Mi porcion es Tu dulce ser poseer,
Mi deseo único eres.</article>
