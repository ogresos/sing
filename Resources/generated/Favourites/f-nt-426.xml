	<article author="Louie B. Apolinares" email="louie.apolinares@yahoo.com" city="Tagbilaran City" provst="Bohol" country="Philippines" month="9" day="21" year="2014">This is one of my favorite hymns. As of the moment when we just finished enjoying the book "The Knowledge of Life", this song just sprang up. Yes, it is very true indeed that LIFE comes out from LIGHT. May the gracious Lord pour out, more of His mercy that the veils of our being may be completely removed. We need more experience of the Lord. More experience means more LIGHT, more LIGHT means more LIFE...</article>

	<article author="AC" email="" city="" provst="" country="Canada" month="9" day="22" year="2011">Often times, our failures are a source of great light. This light functions to shine and to enlighten us (John 1:9). This light many times will expose us and show us our true condition, the type of person we really are. We may not like the shining and it may hurt a lot, but we must be willing to bear the cross and suffer loss for His sake. 

When singing this hymn, my heart was touched in particular with the lines, "I hardly know myself, deceived so much by pride.. and I know Thee even less." I came to realize how much pride and self-righteousness was in me.

But praise the Lord, as the great light He not only shines, but he also chases all our darkness away.
John 1:5, "And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it."
John 12:46, "I have come as light into the world, that everyone who believes into Me would not remain in darkness."

Thank You Lord for Your shining in our hearts. Through Your shining, we can realize how much we really need You. If the Lord can use someone as unstable as Peter and transform him into a living stone, then we can believe He can transform us as well. May we continue to seek and love the Lord's living light.</article>

Lord day by day, moment by moment, uncover me that I may see Thy light. Do not let the enemy deceive me anymore. Unveil me Lord, I need to see You more!</article>

	<article author="Grace Lee" email="" city="Anaheim" provst="California" country="U.S" month="3" day="2" year="2008">I really enjoy this prayer song. Especially verse two is very encouraging to me. Also in 1 Pet. 5:5-6 ... All of you gird yourself with humility towward one another, because God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble. Therefore be humbled under the mighty hand of God that He may exalt you in due time.</article>
