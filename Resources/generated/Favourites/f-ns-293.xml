	<article author="A. Marks" email="" city="Ann Arbor" provst="MI" country="United States" month="3" day="23" year="2009">We need to appreciate that the Lord Jesus Christ is the unique God-man in this universe. Through incarnation God became flesh (John 1:1, 14) as the only-begotten Son of God. When the Lord Jesus walked on the earth He was the only God-man. However, praise the Lord, through His crucifixion and resurrection the only-begotten Son of God became the firstborn Son of God to produce the Body (that's us) as His duplication. Today, we are also God-men, not simply because we have God in our spirit, but because we have this unique God-man Jesus Christ indwelling our human spirit, mingling Himself into us!  Hallelujah! Praise God!</article>
	<article author="KS Hii" email="" city="Miri" provst="Sarawak" country="Malaysia" month="11" day="11" year="2008">(John 3) verse 6 says "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit." We are the flesh and born of the flesh in our natural life. But we were born of God the Spirit to be spirits, gods. That which is born of a cow is a cow. That which is born of a horse is a horse. We are born of the Spirit, and the Spirit is God. John 4:24 tells us clearly that God is Spirit. Because we are born of God the Spirit, we must be gods in life and in nature but not in the Godhead. If we do not believe that we who are born of God are gods, then what are we? That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
