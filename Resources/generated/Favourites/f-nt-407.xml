	<article author="Frank Pytel" email="fpytel@sbcglobal.net" city="Chicago" provst="Illinois" country="" month="8" day="9" year="2015" hostInfoIp="99.112.122.148">Just because something is hidden away from sight, doesn't mean it is not there. Adam and Eve hid, Rachel hid a stolen idol, Achan hid something, David tried to hide sins, and Ananias and Sapphria hid something for themselves, yet all these were not hidden from God's searching eyes.
As in this hymn, Psalm 139:23 uses the word "search" as David's request to God.
I've often resisted this prayer for searching, for there must be hidden things within that have not yet been dealt with, or I just didn't want to see. After honestly praying the words "search me", my actions began to display the hidden impurity within. The loving light of God brought forth what was hidden in my heart. His loving light also brought me to know the precious blood of His Son for forgiveness, and the cross for purging. May His searching in love and mercy continue that I may no longer display myself, but only Christ.
I appreciate the new melody of this hymn which is slower and more sober in His presence.</article>
