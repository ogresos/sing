Also it is medicine for the sick souls. Always when I sing this song it becomes blessing to me because it reminds me that there is no other place Christians can hide, trust and hope except in the cross of our Lord Jesus, the author of our journey. Hallelujah.</article>

	<article author="Dawood Latif" email="dlatif@xtra.co.nz" city="Hamilton" provst="Waikato" country="New Zealand" month="1" day="24" year="2015">This a beautiful hymn on the completed work of CHRIST on the cross. For my wife and to lot of us it brings tears in appreciation of the cost of redemption. May we never forget this free gift. A sinner called and saved by grace. All we had to do was to say THANK YOU. And all we need to take our part - practice/practise. It is a Noun and Verb.</article>

A wonderful song of appreciation of the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, truly inspired by the Holy Spirit. I thank the Lord for leading me to discover this wonderful song that I never knew exists.

Daughter of a county sheriff, she grew up in the village of Melrose. She suffered from poor health most of her life, but that didn't keep her from serving others. She regularly helped the poor and those with disabilities, even selling a horse and carriage to give more money. Her cheery attitude and selfless spirit earned her the nickname, "The Sunbeam of Melrose." She wrote 8 hymns, including "The Ninety and Nine." - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="12" day="14" year="2010">I especially enjoy in v4:
And from my smitten heart, with tears,
 Two wonders I confess,
The wonders of His glorious love,
 And my own worthlessness.

This is such a great summary of what I feel when I read the account of the Lord's suffering for me.</article>

Cannot go to church as once did. Can hear sermons on tv, but miss the music. When humming or singing it brings back the Scripture.
Thank You!</article>
