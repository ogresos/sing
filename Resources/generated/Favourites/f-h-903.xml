	<article author="Tony Pfeiffer" email="visioncoach@hotmail.com" city="Ponce" provst="PR" country="Puerto Rico" month="12" day="9" year="2015">Enjoyed verse 6. "O fill me with Thy fulness, Lord." 
Ephesians 3: 19 May be filled unto the fullness of God. 
Christ is the fullness of God. We can be filled with Him as that fullness. Our corporate filling is the church, the Body of Christ, the fulness of the One who fills all in all.</article>

It really guides us step by step.
He knows the end from the beginning. He is all knowing.
I just have to listen and obey him.
I pray that He leads me as I try to help people in my homeland Uganda in the coming months.</article>

	<article author="Oni Mobolaji Johnson" email="bolatex@live.com" city="FCT" provst="Abuja" country="Nigeria" month="10" day="27" year="2013">This is the song of may life. I came in contact with this song 15 years ago since then I have not forgotten. I bless God for the reunion with the song again. God bless those that put this online. It's a song of commitment to God's work. How to go about His calling over our life, for those that desire to work with God according to desire of composer. May God grant your request and quest in Jesus Name (Amen).</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="9" day="12" year="2013">When Frances Havergal was a child, her father nicknamed her "Little Quicksilver." She had a quick and hungry mind and as a child memorized long passages of Scripture. Her mother died when Frances was only 11, but one of the last things her mother said to her was, "Pray God to prepare you for all He is preparing for you."
Shortly before she wrote this hymn at the age of 36, she wrote in a letter, "I am always getting surprised at my own stupidity. ... If I am to write to any good, a great deal of living must go to a very little writing." About the same time, she also wrote, "I feel like a child writing. You know a child will look up at every sentence and ask, 'What shall I say next? This is what I do. Every line and word and rhyme comes from God." She called this hymn "A Worker's Prayer." - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>

Learned this song in grade school (Demo), and we enjoyed it so much without really understand the REAL impact of the lyrics. 
God must have taught the composer through the HOLY SPIRIT at the time it was written. Thanks.</article>
	<article author="Clayton Wright" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="8" year="2006">Wow! I was seeing my own prayers to the Lord written in this song. I desire to dispense the enjoyment, the very Christ that I have experienced, into others. Praise the Lord for our rich experiences of Himself so that we may express them to the other members of the Body. Praise the Lord that prophesying is an act of carrying out God's economy for His building. Amen!</article>
