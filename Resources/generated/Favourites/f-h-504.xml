My life in Thee, Thy life in me,
 In Thy blest love I rest.
How good it is to muse over hymns Godly people have written from their experiences of Him.</article>

We life and die in Him, the issue of His life is to live with Him eternally, being one with Him.  Romans 14:8: For whether we live, we live to the Lord, and whether we die, we die to the Lord. Therefore whether we live or we die, we are the Lord's. Hallelujah!</article>
