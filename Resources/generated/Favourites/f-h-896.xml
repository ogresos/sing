This is a sobering word from the Lord Jesus to all the saints all over the world! I'm really humbled by this hymn. Jesus is Lord! Amen!</article>

It makes you want to serve the Living God more and more.</article>

Still thinking of the wasted years of idleness and slothfulness. I must not go an empty handed. I must not meet my saviour so. Not even a soul to greet Him? Noooo.........not so.....
Nooo. He must smile upon beholding my face....</article>
