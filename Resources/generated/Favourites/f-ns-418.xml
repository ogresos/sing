    <article author="李 菲 麗" email="ofelia2k@yahoo.com" city="" provst="NC" country="United States" month="8" day="31" year="2013">S.O. who wrote and composed this beautiful song was inspired from the 2013 East Coast College Training. Hallelujah! This is amazing! Inspiring! ["As believers who love the Lord, the Lord’s imminent coming should not mainly be a source of fear to us, but a source of hope and encouragement (Tit. 2:13). We must look forward to it with earnest expectation and joy." via ageturners.com] May we be inspired like the writer by enjoying the messages from this site: http://www.ageturners.com/2013-east-coast-college-training/ E N J O Y!</article>
