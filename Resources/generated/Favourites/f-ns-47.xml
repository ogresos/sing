	<article author="Maureen Mann" email="" city="Surrey" provst="BC" country="Canada" month="7" day="21" year="2011">Operating on too few hours of sleep, I had a booking to be in Vancouver, I could not be a no-show or late. I knew I couldn't make it in my own strength. On my 20 mile commute in rush hour, with a over-burdened bridge to get over in a timely way, this hymn came over the speakers and caught my attention. I played it over and over and was taken to the heavenlies. I arrived with 20 minutes to spare, but who knew, I would draw upon that supply when I received a call from my 16 yr old. My 2 yr old grandson was unconscious, limp with his eyes rolling. She was babysitting alone with 2 children, across the river. I responded to meet her and the EMR. Verse 4 came bubbling up as I returned over the bridge, this time in evening rush hour..."Spirit, You came and You sanctified me. You gave me faith when my eyes couldn't see. Now You're the Spirit of life within me, Hallelujah, Hallelujah!</article>

I began to just praise the Lord for His ongoing mercy to us. Oh Lord we thank You for cleansing us with Your precious blood, making us Your sons and heirs, making us God-men!! Oh Lord Jesus we love You!!</article>
