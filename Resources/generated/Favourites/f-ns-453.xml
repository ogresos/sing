	<article author="Ann Huang" email="ms17ann@gmail.com" city="Irvine" provst="CA" country="United States" month="9" day="28" year="2014">"By considering the enactment of the covenant in Deuteronomy 29 and 30, we can see that what is on God's heart concerning His people is that they would cooperate with Him. To keep the commandments, the statutes, and the judgmentsâ€”this is just to cooperate with God. This is what God wants us to do. We need to say, "Lord, I stand with You. I take You, Your will, and Your word." However, we should not try to do this in ourselves and by ourselves. To do this is to insult the Lord. We should simply cooperate with Him by letting Him do everything. If we do this, we will become not the doers but the enjoyers. Then everything will be fulfilled."
Life-Study of Deuteronomy, Chapter 27, Section 5</article>
