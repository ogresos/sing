Yet please leave Your stripping hand here for my sake.
We often think receiving the Lord means our life will be full of blessing. Yet, actually, the Lord takes many things away from us. However, we will come to realise that having the Lord Himself, at the cost of everything else, is the real blessing.
Thank You, Lord, for Watchman Nee.</article>

Everything happens for a reason and it is better to take His blessed will with all His mercy and love. Take Job's example plus I look at my life and consider why hard times comes upon me. Even Adam and Eve were sent out because they were disobedient so they had to die yet God made a way for them.</article>
