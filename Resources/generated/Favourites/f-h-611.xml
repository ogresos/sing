So I came here to learn how to sing it. I am a vessel made to contain God. This hymn shows how I can experience this.</article>
    <article author="William" email="" city="" provst="Ca" country="United States" month="11" day="20" year="2011">This hymn is very precious. It reminds me that I was created in the image of God according to His likeness (Gen 1:26). It also tells us that God created us and chose us that we might be vessels to contain Him (Romans 9:21). Praise the Lord Jesus for our mingled spirit.</article>
