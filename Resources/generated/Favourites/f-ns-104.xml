Why? That we can know, WITH all the saints who are also allowing God to permeate their heart, who He is — the breadth, length, height, DEPTH of God.
If we want to know God in a deep way, it starts with knowing God in your own heart. Only then are we given the privilege to see God in the hearts of other men—other saints in His Body. Your individual pursuit for the corporate Christ is NEVER in vain; don't ever let the enemy tell you otherwise—redeem the time!</article>
