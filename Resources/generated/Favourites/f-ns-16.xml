	<article author="Douglas Jones" email="dandvjones@gmail.com" city="Brisbane" provst="Qld" country="Australia" month="10" day="10" year="2013">I have written a couple of other verses to go with the original. Happy singing:

I’ve been crucified with Christ,
Been crucified with Him.
I’ve been crucified with Christ,
Been crucified with Him.
He died, He died,
Jesus died for you and me.
I’ve been crucified with Christ,
Been crucified with Him.

I been raised to life in Christ,
Been raised to life in Him.
I been raised to life in Christ,
Been raised to life in Him.
He rose, He rose,
Jesus rose in victory.
I been raised to life in Christ,
Been raised to life in Him.

It’s no longer I that liveth,
But Christ that liveth in me.
It’s no longer I that liveth,
But Christ that liveth in me.
He lives, He lives,
Jesus is alive in me!
It’s no longer I that liveth,
But Christ that liveth in me.</article>

	<article author="Dan Jones" email="" city="Wrexham, UK" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="3" day="6" year="2011">In the Salvation Army our words for this chorus are slightly different.

"It's no longer I that liveth,
But Christ that liveth in me.
It's no longer I that liveth,
But Christ that liveth in me.
In me! In me!
Jesus Christ's alive in me!
It's no longer I that liveth,
But Christ that liveth in me."</article>
