	<article author="Dr Cynthia Sneed" email="professorcynthiasneed@gmail.com" city="Whorton's Bend" provst="Alabama" country="United States" month="7" day="16" year="2016">Such a lovely old hymn. I believe we should synergize the old hymns with the newer "Praise and Worship Songs" today.
 These old hymns have an important message and many were written in times of incredible hardship.
 I am just sick over the USA's lack of will and refusal to stop these terrorists but my country, the one that at one time until about 8 years ago I would have gladly laid down my life to defend and protect, has lost her way taking the people with her.
 One does not "lead from behind" nor do we "love terrorists in order to rid ourselves of terrorism." The country I grew up in had won WWII with Britain and our other allies; she was the most God-fearing nation on earth and had a love for people all over the globe, welcoming those who came here properly with proper documentation.
 The president has knowingly and willingly adopted policies to divide and destroy America and he, with the help of low-information to no-information voters has succeeded.
  The leftists socialists have taken over the schools and the medias. The schools no longer teach "value based education" (no God, no golden rule no right from wrong bc who is to say what is right? Remember the media and the president tell us: one man's terrorists is another man's freedom fighter" except true freedom fighters do not target and murder women and children and citizens.
 Those are cowards. 
I pray for the world: join with me in prayer for peace and victory over those who have declared Holy War against us bc one they have we are in a Holy War like it or not. 
 We can only win or lose and right now we are losing.
