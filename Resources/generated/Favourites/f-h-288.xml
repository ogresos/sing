	<article author="Martin Benjamin-Addy" email="mbaddy@gmail.com" city="Accra" provst="Greater Accra" country="Ghana" month="7" day="10" year="2015">This hymn is one that reveals the Love, Nature and Character of God to me in such a special way that words are not enough to express my feelings. The tune I sing with was taught to me by the Holy Spirit before I came across the words of the hymn. I can say that this hymn was specially written for me. Thank You Dear Holy Spirit, You are such a wonder.</article>

Thank God for using you and your ministry. The Holy Spirit is truly at work and the Lord has more than one way to reach a broken soul. My soul is lifted up this morning as I am reminded that I have a Friend, oh, such a Friend that loves so tenderly more than any human love that I am longing for. Will pray for you and your ministry as I ask for you to do the same. God bless. Maranatha!</article>
	<article author="Rishie" email="rishie@dodo.com.au" city="Glen Innes" provst="Nsw" country="Australia" month="1" day="16" year="2013">I've been reading through some of these beautiful hymns and spending time praising, adoring and worshipping God. It's been a fantastic time! 
I remember when I gave my life to the Lord when I was 8 the thing that lead me to this decision was the knowledge that Jesus would be my Friend who would be with me always! He has always proved to be that faithful and loving Friend He promised to be. He is willing to be your Friend too. O Jesus, I love You. Thank You. Blessings!</article>
