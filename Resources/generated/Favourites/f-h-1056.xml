	<article author="GOB Ezekiel" email="faithfultriumph@gmial.com" city="Jos" provst="Plateau" country="" month="2" day="14" year="2016">I see exactly myself in the picture this song painted and my hope is that precious and spotless Blood that was shed. That is my only hope and with this hope I got some courage that I can still push a little more further, and I can still get to the promise. With this hope I'm not giving up yet on myself, because he has absolute knowledge of how it feels whenever I fall along the way, I can hear him say get up and move on, I shed my blood for you!</article>

No Preparation can I make, My best resolves I only break, Yet save me for thine own Name sake, and Take me as I am.</article>
	<article author="LG Dogara" email="dogaralivingstone@yahoo.co.uk" city="Zaria" provst="Kaduna" country="Nigeria" month="4" day="23" year="2015">This is me helpless and full of guilt. Daily I made promises that I will not allow my eyes take me astray but after a while I break. If it is by my own righteousness I can not measure up to You Lord but glory be to God it is with Your righteousness. Yet Lord take me as I am.
Thou canst make me as thou wilt. I can't go on like this, work in me to grow and overcome.</article>

You ignore my transgressions and forgive my iniquities. For my sake, you were shamed and crucified on the cross, and what do I give you in return? Nothing; at best, I break all my best resolves, but you still love me unconditionally. Sweet Jesus, please "take me as I am" lest I perish.</article>
	<article author="Ayo Oloruntoba" email="clem4tob@yahoo.co.uk" city="Ashford" provst="Kent" country="United Kingdom" month="1" day="25" year="2015">I woke up this morning with a line of the lyrics of this hymn - My only plea is CHRIST died for me. So I went for one of the leaflet that I have at home from one of the retreats that I have attended in the past organised by Peace House Gboko Nigeria Western Zone. I found the song there but I needed the right tune for it so I went into the search engine to bring it up.
I am richly blessed by this song today. As I spend this day in the presence of my Maker alone seeking a way forward not by my own righteousness but by that blood shed for me by my Saviour CHRIST Jesus .</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="9" day="10" year="2014">Years ago, while re­viv­al meet­ings were be­ing held in one of the large towns in Scot­land, a young girl be­came anx­ious about her spir­it­u­al con­di­tion. Re­turn­ing from one of the meet­ings, she went to her own min­is­ter and asked him how she might be saved.
“Ah, lass­ie,” he said, “don’t be alarmed! Just read your Bi­ble and say your pray­ers, and you will be all right.”
But the poor, il­lit­er­ate girl cried out: “O Min­is­ter, I can­na read, I can­na pray! Lord Je­sus, take me as I am!”
In this way the girl became a fol­low­er of Christ; and a la­dy who heard of the girl’s ex­per­i­ence wrote this hymn…I found the vers­es in a re­li­gious news­pa­per and set them to the sim­ple mu­sic by which they are now most gen­er­al­ly known. At the same time Mr. Steb­bins al­so found the vers­es and set them to mu­sic, and he sent them to me at the same time that I was send­ing my tune for the same words to him. In “Gos­pel Hymns” both tunes are pub­lished.
A min­is­ter in Eng­land writes to me about a Christ­ian wo­man, a shoe­mak­er’s wife, who had a lodg­er that was an ob­stin­ate un­be­liev­er. “The good wo­man oft­en tried to in­duce him to go to meet­ings, but in vain. Tracts which she placed on the ta­ble in his room she found crushed on the floor. She would smooth them out and again place them so as to at­tract his at­ten­tion, but he would read no­thing but his no­vels and news­pa­pers. One spring the old man fell ill with bron­chi­tis. The good wo­man act­ed as his nurse, for he had no rel­a­tives who cared for him. She used the op­por­tun­i­ty, oft­en speak­ing to him about his soul and read­ing the Word of God; but she could make no im­press­ion up­on him. One day she was read­ing the hymn ‘Je­sus, my Lord, to Thee I cry,’ and when she came to the re­frain, the old man called out to her sharply: ‘That’s not in the book!’ The wo­man an­swered, ‘Why yes, it is.’ He de­clared again that he did not be­lieve it was in the book. The good wo­man told him that he could read it for him­self. He asked for his glass­es, and read with won­der and amaze­ment, again and again, ‘My on­ly plea—Christ died for me! oh, take me as I am.’ A few weeks af­ter­ward he said to the wo­man one morn­ing, ‘I am go­ing home to-day, and I am so hap­py, so hap­py!’ In an hour or two he passed away, re­peat­ing those words to the last.”
