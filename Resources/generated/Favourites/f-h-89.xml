4 O give us hearts to love like Thee!
 Like Thee, O Lord, to grieve
 Far more for othersâ€™ sins than all
 The wrongs that we receive.
-------------------------------
5 One with Thyself, may every eye
 In us, Thy brethren, see
 The gentleness and grace that spring
 From union, Lord, with Thee.
----------------------------
Also, the original stanza 3, line 1, says "might" instead of "did".</article>
