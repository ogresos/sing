Enjoyed this hymn very much and was not only comforted but also strengthened by The Lord to press on! What a wonderful hope of glory we have in Him as promised in His word! Being reminded of this in the midst of sufferings is such an encouragement to keep looking away unto the Author and Perfecter of our faith.</article>
