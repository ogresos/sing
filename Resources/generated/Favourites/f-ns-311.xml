    <article author="Cathy" email="cathychris1225@yahoo.com" city="Baguio City" provst="Benguet" country="Philippines" month="2" day="25" year="2013">I really appreciate this hymn that tells us that we need a proper prayer life, not a prayer for our own sake or for our own interest here on earth but a prayer that would turn the age, a prayer that is for the Lord sake and for His ECONOMY. That's why we are being encouraged to become a man of prayer because prayer is our spiritual breathing.
We need a prayer that would bring in the kingdom of God and for the Lord to come back. Praise the Lord!</article>
    <article author="Betty Jane Bonn" email="" city="Dunlap" provst="Illinois" country="United States" month="10" day="11" year="2012">The music doesn't seem to correspond to the singing of the words in this hymn, "Two Greatest Prayers of Paul." Would you check it out for us, please?

The words are absolutely wonderful!

I recognize this melody as from an old hymn that contains words something like the following:
"An old-fashioned Bible,"
"An old-fashioned church,"
"An old-fashioned gospel",
"An old-fashioned meeting," etc.

Thank you.</article>
