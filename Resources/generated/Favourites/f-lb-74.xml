but chose a Somebody, the Best!
He married her and then she was able to enter into rest and enjoy all that was His.
We are that Ruth, only in The Lord is that we found rest and now we are enjoying all that He is to all who chose Him as their Husband!
Lord Jesus, our dear Bridegroom, we love You! 
In every situation we take You as our Bridegroom, enter into rest and enjoy what You are to us...and all You have...we have the right to partake of all You are...</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="1" day="16" year="2012">I like to thank hymnal.net for publishing both the song, music and music sheet, so I could share this song at church.

I called this song at church yesterday. It was very sweet. A brother who knew knew Howard, the author, testified that Howard lived across from a college campus and had his home open 24 hrs/day for any student to come over. He had 2 refrigerators stocked with food for students.

My feeling about this song is that it's amazing. The truth is so high, yet it reaches everyone, young, old and new. There are a lot of songs about the marriage of Christ and the church, but this is the most touching to me. This song does not become doctrinal nor depart from the sense of word in an overly emotional way.</article>

	<article author="Laura Lo" email="" city="Tampa" provst="FL" country="U.S.A." month="7" day="16" year="2003">My husband and I both love this song. But I particularly love this song because it shows me how our marriage is not just a part of God's plan, but more importantly, a true shadow of the divine marriage between God and his chosen elect, the church. In this divine marriage man is God's satisfaction, and God is man's real satisfaction. When Christ is the center of our marriage, we can be a satisfaction to our spouse. This is the kind of marriage I desire.</article>
