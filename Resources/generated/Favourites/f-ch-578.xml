Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!
 That calls me from a world of care,
 And bids me at my Father’s throne
 Make all my wants and wishes known.
 In seasons of distress and grief,
 My soul has often found relief
 And oft escaped the tempter’s snare
 By thy return, sweet hour of prayer!

"Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!
 The joys I feel, the bliss I share,
 Of those whose anxious spirits burn
 With strong desires for thy return!
 With such I hasten to the place
 Where God my Savior shows His face,
 And gladly take my station there,
 And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer!" (not translated to Chinese)

Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!
 Thy wings shall my petition bear
 To Him whose truth and faithfulness
 Engage the waiting soul to bless.
 And since He bids me seek His face,
 Believe His Word and trust His grace,
 I’ll cast on Him my every care,
 And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer!

 

Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!
 May I thy consolation share,
 Till, from Mount Pisgah’s lofty height,
 I view my home and take my flight:
 This robe of flesh I’ll drop and rise
 To seize the everlasting prize;
 And shout, while passing through the air,
“Farewell, farewell, sweet hour of prayer!”</article>
