	<article author="IrisCrystal Seok" email="tgnrsvt@yahoo.com" city="" provst="" country="South Korea" month="1" day="9" year="2014">When I migrated to a foreign country many years ago, right after moving into a rental apartment upon arrival in that country, I came to realize that under the circumstance of the urgent need for finding out a place to stay, without any necessary information on that locality altogether, I myself had made a mistake of signing up one year’s lease contract on the wrong place which was arranged like a trap for a naive foreigner. People around me there told me that in their consideration of my case, my moving out from that wrong place appeared to be almost impossible and the only option for me to take would be just to suffer from the situation until the end of the lease contract, which seemed to continually bring in much trouble in the home living before the Lord. 
  Then, one morning when I woke up, I found myself listening to this very hymn springing from my heart. Listening to and singing together this hymn gushing up from my heart at that time, I could be reminded of and be reassured by the Lord’s trustworthy leading with each specific arrangement in the future steps, whatever the outward situation may be and people may say. 
  This hymn reminds me of His everlasting arms we can lean on as the protection in our daily pilgrim living here and the very fellowship, into which we were called (1Cor. 1:9) and which is supposed to take us in mutual dwelling (Dt. 33:27, Ps.90:1, 91:1~2, 9, Jn.15:4) and in mutual serving and enjoyment (Jn.12:26, Lk. 17:7~10, Ezk.44:15, Rev. 3:20, Lk.12:37) in His grace and mercy. We thank You and praise You, Lord, for Your amazing love for us (Rom. 8:32), which constrains us to live to You (2Cor. 5:14-15) and leads us into another realm for our being more than conjurers (Rom. 8:37) here below in You and You only.</article>

I have been looking into the history of this hymn to give a short 5 mins talk on it then sing it at a Lunch Club I go to tomorrow and while I found some information on its history I wondered what the bad news was that prompted the originator A.J. Showalter to think along these lines and you have answered the question in my mind "That he had heard from two former students who had both lost their wives on the same day".
I will add this to my notes. 

Thank you once more!
May the Lord bless you.</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="1" day="30" year="2013">One afternoon in 1887, music teacher A. J. Showalter dismissed his class and returned to his rooming house in Hartsville, Alabama. There he found letters from 2 former students, each with a similar story. Both of them had lost their wives, and both wives had died on the same day. Showalter began writing letters of condolence. The Scripture that came to mind was Deuteronomy 33:26-27, the assurance of God's "everlasting arms" supporting us. 
Then he wrote a 3rd letter, to Elisha Hoffman, a hymnwriter in Pennsylvania. Showalter suggested that Hoffman write a hymn on that theme. He even suggested the wording of the chorus. Hoffman responded quickly with 3 stanzas and Showalter supplied the music. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton

It seems this hymn was produced by a life caring for others, having the living word including the riches of the Old Testament, and fellowship.</article>

Indeed HIS arms are not short to reach us out but they make me feel so secured whatever path I am walking on. HIS everlasting arms to protect me are my greatest comfort when things get tough. I do like the tune and tempo as well.</article>
