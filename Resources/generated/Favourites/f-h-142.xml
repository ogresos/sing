Crown Him the King of kings
The Almighty God
Who over all the nations rules 
With an iron rod
All hail, the Lord of Lords
Who shall reign forever
Our praise shall never, never cease
Through all eternity.</article>

Crown Him the Son of God, 
Before the worlds began,
And ye who tread where He hath trod, 
Crown Him the Son of Man;
Who every grief hath known 
That wrings the human breast,
And takes and bears them for His own, 
That all in Him may rest.

Crown Him the Lord of life, 
Who triumphed o’er the grave,
And rose victorious in the strife 
For those He came to save.
His glories now we sing, 
Who died, and rose on high,
Who died eternal life to bring, 
And lives that death may die.

Crown Him the Lord of Lords, 
Who over all doth reign,
Who once on earth, the incarnate Word, 
For ransomed sinners slain,
Now lives in realms of light, 
Where saints with angels sing
Their songs before Him day and night, their God, Redeemer, King.

Crown Him the Lord of Heav’n, 
Enthroned in worlds above,
Crown Him the king to whom is giv’n 
The wondrous name of Love.
Crown Him with many crowns, 
As thrones before Him fall;
Crown Him, ye kings, with many crowns, 
For He is king of all.

Crown Him the Lord of Heav’n! 
One with the Father known,
One with the Spirit through Him giv’n 
From yonder glorious throne!
To Thee be endless praise, 
For Thou for us hast died;
Be Thou, O Lord, thro’ endless days 
Adored and magnified.

God bless you all!</article>
	<article author="Jeannine MacGregor" email="" city="Mountain View" provst="California" country="United States" month="6" day="24" year="2012">While I am in the midst of a trial my heart has been singing this song. I just start humming it at odd times through out the day and even wake in the middle of night. "Awake my soul and sing of Him who died for thee. And hail Him as thy matchless King throughout eternity." My soul had been sleeping as I had been retreating like a wounded animal and hiding from my God and life in pain. But the pain became unbearable and caused me to awaken from my slumber and cry out to Jesus for His help. Jesus is helping me as I reach out and ask for help from wonderful, kind and caring Christians in my life. And now that I am "awake" I see how much Jesus loves me even unto death and I am eternally and extremely grateful to Him for His love and even the smallest blessings in my life. I have an attitude of gratitude and worship even though my circumstances have not changed for the better. You could even say they have become even more intense... Yet God is mighty and faithful and He will help me through my trials. May you too find God's blessings even in the midst of your storms of life.</article>
