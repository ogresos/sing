	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="6" day="11" year="2013">J. W. Van De Venter was a schoolteacher by profession but an artist at heart. Teaching school allowed him to make a living while he continued his study of drawing and painting. After evangelistic meetings in his church, friends saw his gifts in counseling and working with people and urged him to become an evangelist. For 5 years he wavered between his love of art and what seemed to be God's calling him to evangelistic ministry.
He later recalled, "At last the pivotal hour of my life came and I surrendered all. A new day was ushered into my life. I became an evangelist and discovered down deep in my soul a talent hitherto unknown to me." A few years later, Van De Venter, remembering that decisive moment, wrote this hymn. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>

ONLY God could do this! This one- sided love is beyond comprehension without revelation! That when I was lost and in Satan's grip God loved me. How could He get me back? I was so precious to Him that though He owns 'the cattle on a thousand hills', He found them insufficient to pay for me. So He had to give up His most priceless possession, His Son (This is the ONLY limitation God ever had - He didn't have anything more precious than His Son Jesus) to die for me to pay the debt for my redemption! And all this, when I didn't know a thing! Now that I know, what a wonder! What can I give in return? Nothing, because I own nothing except all He has given me. So at His feet I surrender them all! He is worth more than a trillion of them. Take all, Lord Jesus. I worship You!</article>

	<article author="Fredrickson Benzito" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="5" day="15" year="2012">Seeking communion (aiming to please Him, having an intimate relationship and fully understanding and trusting Him) with God should at the very most be the first purpose of a Christian here on earth. 
For a believer to maximize his or hers full potential, laying hold of the gifts and opportunities availed to them by God, it would be wise for one to know for what purpose we are serving Him. We are all created differently (fearfully and wonderfully), but for what reason? Every person is assigned his or her own place in the Divine Plan in Christ. Daniel 11:32b – Those who know their God shall be strong and do mighty exploits. 
The second aim for every Christian is to bare fruits of the same kind. Sharing the Good News that Jesus Christ is alive and alive forever more, bringing people to repentance, so that they may also share in the same communion with God as every Christian. To be a fruitful branch, blossoming and giving fruit in its full potential. This is what the Christian life is all about.</article>

	<article author="Frank Pytel" email="" city="Chicago" provst="Illinois" country="United States" month="4" day="18" year="2010">When the gospel came to me, it unveiled the wonderful Person, Jesus Christ, and His unique work. As this Word of Christ entered my heart, it evoked the twofold response of faith and love toward Him. Mary desired Him as the one thing as she listened to His word (Luke 10:39,42), then broke and poured forth all she had on Him (Mark 14:3). May the faith that connects me to Him increase, and my love that surrenders all be continually poured upon Him.</article>
	<article author="Davmarius Hayes" email="" city="Martin" provst="TN" country="United States" month="3" day="25" year="2010">9 months ago I fell to my knees and repented to God. I told Him I was tired of this miserable world of sin and I didn't want to SIN ANY MORE. I told Him I would give up everything. I just wanted to be saved. I just wanted to be free for real, and on June 5, 2009, God saved me. For 9 months I have been living a life free from all willfully committed sin by the grace of God. I depend solely on Him and put all my trust in Him and He guides me each and everyday. He has renewed my mind, body, and soul. I am a living sacrifice for Him. I am His servant. I have decided to follow Jesus. No turning back. I have made up my mind. I'm going to live for Jesus. I give Him my all because He is everything to me. So I totally despise sin. I hate it. Sin is exceedingly sinful to me. I will live spotless and blameless in this world. Living a life free from sin, I am able to have that true connection, that beautiful realtionship that I so longed for. He supplies my every need. He is so faithful. I know He will stay the same forever. I love God with all my heart, soul, mind and strength. I surrender all. :)</article>
