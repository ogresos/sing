The true worship of God is not only in spirit but also in truthfulness. Many among us do not know what it means to worship God in spirit. Christians in the West often understand the word spirit in this verse to mean the Holy Spirit. Christians in the East, however, do not have this problem, because the Chinese Union Version adds the word heart before the word spirit to form the term heart-spirit. This rendering sounds nice when it is read in Chinese. However, we must ask, what does heart-spirit refer to? One of the Chinese hymns, #327, had a line that said, "Lord, cleanse my heart-spirit." When we were compiling this hymn into our hymn book, Brother Nee asked us what heart-spirit means. The heart is the heart, and the spirit is the spirit, but what is heart-spirit? Since the term heart-spirit confuses people, we changed that line in the hymn to, "Lord, cleanse my spirit."
