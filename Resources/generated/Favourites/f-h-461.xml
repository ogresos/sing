	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="7" day="16" year="2014">“I wrote this hymn in 1878,” the Rev. W. O. Cush­ing tells me. “Long­ing to give up all for Christ who had giv­en his life for me, I want­ed to be will­ing to lay ev­er­ything at his feet, with no wish but to do his will, to live hence­forth on­ly for his glo­ry. Out of this feel­ing came the hymn, ‘Fol­low On.’ It was writ­ten with the pray­er and the hope that some heart might by it be led to give up all for Christ. Much of the pow­er and use­ful­ness of the hymn, how­ev­er, are due to Mr. Low­ry, who put it in­to song.” - Sankey's Story of the Gospel Hymns
-------------
Cushing was known as a noble, sweet, spiritual Christian gentleman to those who knew him. Those who met him were inspired by him and loved him. - Songs of the Spirit by Martin
--------------
In the original stanza 3, "heart" is "soul" and "in the rest of God" is "on the hills of God."

We should always walk with Him, obey and remove fear of anything.</article>
