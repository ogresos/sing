	<article author="Margaret" email="mnoecker@live.com" city="Hastings" provst="Nebraska" country="United States" month="1" day="31" year="2016">I just returned from a retreat this past weekend which was a spiritually life-changing experience for me on a personal level. Tonight as I finished Night Prayer in front of Blessed Sacrament, I wanted a hymn to sing to Him that spoke what my heart was feeling. I typed into my iPhone 'night hymn' and this song from you was right there. Oh my, it could not have been more fitting for me at this time. It describes my retreat experience in every way way. I know Jesus chose it for me. Thank you so much!!</article>
	<article author="Dennis Evans" email="revden1@btinternet.com" city="East Yorkshire" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="11" day="4" year="2015">In the early hours of this day, as I was earnestly seeking the Lord... this song came to mind. As a young lad my dear mother would take up her accordion piano and play the old gospel songs including this beloved song, and we children would join in and song along. It was and yet today is impactful... I used my mobile and put the first lines of the song 'out of my bondage sorrow and night, Jesus I come' the song appeared... its lyrics touched me deep within and yes soothed my spirit. To God be the glory!</article>

Thank you and God bless you.</article>

	<article author="Esther" email="enyagah@gmail.com" city="Nairobi" provst="" country="Kenya" month="7" day="16" year="2013">I love this hymn indeed. Whenever I am seeking God's deliverance in any area of my life, I normally repent my sins and most of the time I am led by the Holy Spirit to sing this hymn. It really ushers me into God's presence. 

I thank God for the pastor who started our Pentecostal church (which has grown into several assemblies for the last 15 years). This pastor was has since gone back to Canada was used by God to nurture the church members in walking in holiness and singing in hymns alot. I attribute my love for hymns to his mentorship. Glory be to God.</article>

But looked up this hymn because I recently revisited a football ground in London, 29 years after attending a Luis Palau "Mission to London" rally as a student. As someone has commented on a Billy Graham rally, this hymn was also used at the altar call at the Mission to London. Thank God for the love and commitment of people who work tirelessly to share the salvation they have received with others.</article>
