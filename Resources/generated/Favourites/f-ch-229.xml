    <article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="12" day="20" year="2010">Today we are in Christ. Since we are saved and have been joined to the Lord, we are in Christ (2 Cor. 5:17). This is like being a passenger in a boat. Even though the ocean is deep and vast, we can sleep peacefully because we are in the boat. Therefore, we should loudly sing, "Now I'm already in Christ; /1 have left Adam's realm; / All old things have become new, / Earthly became heav'nly! / Praise the Lord, here I can enjoy grace, / Fully tasting life and peace! / Praise the Lord, I am in the Lord now!" (Hymns, #229 in Chinese). Hallelujah! We are in the "boat," in Christ. This is so precious. We are not in ourselves or in Adam; we are in God. Today we have the Bible in our hands and the Holy Spirit in our spirit. God is in us, and we are in Christ; this is sufficient. We should boldly proclaim, "Hallelujah! I am saved, I have the life of God, and God is in me!"
