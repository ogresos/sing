He was an evangelical Anglican and also closely associated with the Keswick Convention. He was a scholar, but could also speak and write for ordinary people. He wrote hymns, poems, commentaries, expositions on books of the New Testament and books on devotion. This hymn is based upon Exodus 21:5-6. The law in these verses concerns a slave who upon release decides not to leave his master but to remain his slave forever. This portrays the believer's willing and absolute consecration to the Lord for whatever He desires. This poetic hymn extols the freedom of being the Lord's bondslave, the weariness of self's liberties, and the ability of "pierced ears" to hear the Lord's speaking. - Songs of the Spirit by Martin</article>
