I had not heard it sung for so many years. Did not know where to find the lyrics. Found an old song book from the 70's but I could not remember the first words. Then I just said, "Lord, there is a song within me", and I looked down on the page in the index and there it was. Oh, thank You, Lord, You melt my heart. You are all I need and I love You!!</article>

There is so much that we desire in our soul. We need this One to constantly remind us that He is all we need and He loves us.</article>

Perhaps it is because only the Lover of Our Soul can meet everything in our soul. O Jesus, You are the One who has conquered my soul, spread more and more, gain it all. Do it in my lifetime.  Until I get it, speak to me, again and again the words:

"All of your heart's desire
is found in Me;
I'm all you need and I love you."</article>
