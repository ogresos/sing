I didn't know who had written the hymn but I was interested to learn that it was a Scot! I was born in Glasgow, Scotland.
The Lord brought the words to my mind "revive me" and I immediately did a search for this beautiful hymn. I believe it was Gaither Muscians who were singing it. 
I am reading a beautiful story about Lilias Trotter who had given up the opportunity for "a brilliant career as an artist to serve Christ" as a missionary in Algeria, North Africa for forty years!  It was while reading this inspiring story that the Lord brought to my mind the words "revive me" and I remembered the hymn!
May the Lord revive me and HisÂ Church!
Shalom!

	<article author="Rev. Ezekiel Lekyes Dampo" email="dampoezekiel@gmail.com" city="Kaduna" provst="" country="Nigeria" month="2" day="5" year="2014">This song made a great impression on me after watching the evangelical film titled "Peace Child." Shot in an African setting, this song indeed calls forth the praise of the Almighty for great things he has done and is doing and will continue to do.</article>
	<article author="Enyinnaya Appolos" email="eappolos@gmail.com" city="Abuja" provst="" country="Nigeria" month="8" day="31" year="2013">While I was growing up in Isiko, a hamlet in Ngwaland in Abia State, this hymn was one of my favorite hymns in the NAH of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, we sing it every Sabbath, from the Igbo hymn, Abu Otuto...though the hymn is not included in the current SDAH hymnal of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, I still enjoy singing the hymn to God's glory. It is still fresh in my memory, how as little children, we used to hum stanzas as the adult sing, and join them shouting the chorus: "Hallelujah! Thine the glory, Hallelujah! Amen; Hallelujah! Thine the glory, We praise Thee again (revive us again)."</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="6" day="3" year="2013">William P. MacKay was a Scottish physician turned minister.

The title of this song is "Revive us again". The original last line of the chorus is "Revive us again."

The original 3rd and last stanzas are:
---------------
All glory and praise
To the Lamb that was slain
Who has borne all our sins
And has cleansed ev'ry stain.
-------------
Revive us again --
Fill each heart with Thy love;
May each soul be rekindled
With fire from above.
---------------
There is also another verse that comes after the 3rd verse:
All glory and praise
To the God of all grace,
Who hast brought us, and sought us,
And guided our ways.</article>
