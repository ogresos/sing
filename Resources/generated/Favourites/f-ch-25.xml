SUBJECT: WORSHIP OF THE FATHER-HIS LOVE

1	What love Thou hast bestowed on us,
 	 	We thank Thee from our heart;
 	Our Father, we would worship Thee
 	 	And praise for all Thou art.
2	Thy heart Thou hast revealed to us,
 	 	Made known th’ eternal will;
 	Within the Son Thou hast come forth,
 	 	Thy purpose to fulfill.
3	Thou gavest Thy beloved Son
 	 	In love to come and die,
 	That we may be Thy many sons,
 	 	As heirs with Him, made nigh.
4	Through Him we have Thy very life
 	 	And Thou our Father art;
 	Thy very nature, all Thyself,
 	 	Thou dost to us impart.
5	Thy Spirit into ours has come
 	 	That we may “Abba” cry;
 	Of Spirit born, with Spirit sealed,
 	 	To be transformed thereby.
6	The many sons to glory brought
 	 	Is Thine eternal goal,
 	And to Thy Son’s own image wrought,
 	 	Thou wilt conform the whole.
7	Throughout Thy transformation work
 	 	Thou dost direct each one,
 	From glory unto glory bring
 	 	Until the work is done.
8	What love Thou, Father, hast bestowed;
 	 	We’ll ever grateful be;
 	We’ll worship Thee forevermore
 	 	And praise unceasingly.</article>
