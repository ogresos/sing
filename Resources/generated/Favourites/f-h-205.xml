    <article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="11" day="18" year="2013">A nobleman by birth, Bernard of Clairvaux gave up a life of luxury to follow Christ. So when he writes about being "unfilled" by "the best bliss that earth imparts," he knows.
The monastic life was often one of withdrawal. Monks had their own communities, which were largely self-sufficient. Thus they could work and pray in relative solitude. But Bernard broke out of that system and became an unusually public figure for a monk. He challenged popes and political leaders to live righteously. He urged professors to teach truth. He launched evangelistic campaigns.
We can learn much from Bernard's example. We do need time for "calm and bright" moments alone with Christ. But we also need to let Him send us forth in service. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton

The 1st line of the last stanza originally said:
O Jesus, ever with us stay,</article>

The Lord of this hymn thrilled their hearts as has so many in the nine hundred years since Bernard of Clairvaux wrote it. One Day we will see the Lord face to face; oh what a day that will be, won't it?</article>
    <article author="Rodger Campbell" email="rwrcampbell@gmail.com" city="Wellington" provst="" country="New Zealand" month="1" day="1" year="2013">A wonderful song to start morning revival with. Speaks so much of who our Lord is experientially (Joy of loving hearts, Fount of life, Light of men, truth unchanged, living bread, the Fountain-head, our strength &amp; stay). I especially love lines 3 &amp; 4 in stanza 1: "From the best bliss that earth imparts, We turn unfilled to Thee again."

Whom have we upon the earth but thee O Lord! Nothing is sweeter than You Lord Jesus!</article>
    <article author="Gabriel" email="" city="White Rock" provst="BC" country="Canada" month="2" day="13" year="2012">It is only when we love our Lord Jesus that He becomes our joy. How we need to eat Him as the Living Bread (Jn. 6:51), and drink of Him at the Fountain-head (Jn. 4:14; Rev. 22:1) day by day, moment by moment. Then only, can we say, "O Jesus, ever stay with us." Even though this hymn was written almost 900 years ago and translated about 150 years ago, in our spirit we can appreciate the writer's and translator's yearning and appreciation of the Lord.</article>
