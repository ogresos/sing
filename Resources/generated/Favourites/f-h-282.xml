God bless you and the creators of this site.</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="3" day="2" year="2014">There are 2 additional stanzas in the original:
Following the 1st stanza:
2 Let me see my Savior's face,
Let me all His beauties trace;
Show those glorious truths to me
Which are only known to Thee.
----------------------------
The original has a 6th stanza at the end:
6 See, to Thee I yield my heart,
Shed Thy life through every part;
A pure temple I would be,
Wholly dedicate to Thee.</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="6" day="1" year="2013">The 1st line of each stanza in the original says "Holy Ghost" instead of "Lord of xxx", and the last verse says "Holy Spirit" instead of "Lord, the Spirit", so here are the original 1st lines:
1. Holy Ghost, with light divine,
2. Holy Ghost, with pow'r divine,
3. Holy Ghost, with joy divine,
4. Holy Spirit, all divine,

A Congregational pastor in London, Andrew Reed founded 6 hospitals for the sick and helpless in London, including the London Orphan Asylum, the Asylum for Fatherless Children, the Hospital for Incurables, and the Asylum for Idiots. While the names of the institutions may seem strange to modern ears, they were all much-needed missions of mercy.
Andrew Reed's son wanted to write a biography of his father and asked for some biographical information. Andrew responded with these words, "I was born yesterday; I shall die tomorrow; I must not spend today in telling what I have done, but in doing what I may for Him who has done so much for me." - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>
