	<article author="IrisCrystal Seok" email="tgnrsvt@yahoo.com" city="" provst="" country="South Korea" month="1" day="12" year="2014">Another well-known lyric by George Croly (1780~1860) on the same tune of this hymn, which I love too:
"Spirit of God,
Descend upon my heart;
Wean it from earth
Through all its pulses move;
Stoop to my weakness,
Mighty as Thou art,
And make me love Thee 
As I ought to love."</article>
	<article author="Isaiah Tor" email="" city="Sydney" provst="NSW" country="Australia" month="5" day="3" year="2009">This hymn has a very sweet and intimate tone in describing our relationship with our Father God. Its pinnacle lies not in an objective appreciation of the Father's greatness, but rather particularly in verses 2-3, we perceive the intimate union of life between the Father and ourselves, His sons. And we see also, so emphatically that it is in enjoying the Father's life and tasting the nature of His person, His love (abiding in Him) that we truly know Him in unparalleled depths and untraceable heights. This is not objective religion, but rather portraying the sentiment and experience of being "in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ"(1 Thes. 1:1).</article>
	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="6" year="2009">The last group of hymns in our hymnal under the category of "Worship of the Father" is titled "His Praise from Many Sons." This group of hymns is the highest. Many Christians do not understand what "His praise from many sons" means. It refers to the praise offered by the Lord Jesus together with His brothers. Hymns, #50 is in this group and contains deep truth concerning God's economy. It is a hymn of praise to the Father from many sons. This is related to God's economical aspect.
