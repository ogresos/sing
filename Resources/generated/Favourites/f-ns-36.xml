Empty myself of all but You;
Give You my best love,
Preeminence in all I do.

Sometimes I feel my love for God is so cold and superficial, I am so far from first love, but I want to get there, I want to obey the command to love the Lord my God with all my heart and mind and soul and strength. Father, dear father God, please help me. Amen.</article>

	<article author="Chay Dionco" email="" city="Sta. Maria" provst="Bulacan" country="Philippines" month="12" day="20" year="2002">This song sings out the melody in my heart. It speaks of my experience and consecration...Our heart needs to be guarded all the time.

Even in my college days, and my full-time training days I've always been renewed through consecration hymns and messages.

Now that I am working, I experience that sometimes I miss the Lord...I miss our intimate fellowship...

I don't want my work to occupy my first love...I always remember that I am enslaved by His love to serve Him in His Body and that HE is my Master and my whole being is entirely HIS!

I love Him more and more. I pray that His love will make me wholly Thine!</article>
