Samuel H. Cox, D.D., was born at Mendham, New Jersey, May 10,1818. Graduating at the University of New York in 1838, and taking Holy Orders in 1841, he became Rector of St. John's, Hartford, Connecticut, in the following year. In 1851 he visited England, and on his return was elected Rector of Grace Church, Baltimore, 1854, and Calvary, New York, 1863. His consecration as Bishop of the Western Diocese of New York took place in 1865. His residence is at Buffalo. Coxe is the author of numerous works. His poetical works were mostly written in early life, Some of Coxe's hymns are found in the collections of every religious body in America, except the official collections of his own. This is accounted for by his too scrupulous modesty. As a member of the Hymnal Committee, in 1869-71, he refused to permit the insertion of his own lyrics. - Dictionary of Hymnology by John Julian 1907</article>

2 Oh who like thee, so calm, so bright,
 So pure, so made to live in light?
---------------
The original stanza 3, line 3 says:
So meek, forgiving, Godlike, high,
------------
There is an additional stanza 4 following stanza 3 above:
4 And all thy life's unchanging years,
A man of sorrows and of tears,
The cross, where all our sins were laid,
Upon thy bending shoulders weighed.
--------------
There is an additional stanza which is sometimes given as the last stanza instead of stanza 5 above:
O in thy light be mine to go,
Illuming all this way of woe;
And give me ever on the road
To trace thy footsteps, Son of God!</article>
