	<article author="Hudson" email="" city="Wellington" provst="" country="New Zealand" month="7" day="23" year="2012">The last verse is so good. It reminds me of this point in the ministry,
Regarding the standing boards of the tabernacle : "the gold was not only the oneness of the standing boards; it was also their glory. By being overlaid with gold, the standing boards bore the glory of the gold, for the shining of the gold was their glory, their expression....Hence the oneness of the forty-eight boards was not only in the gold, ... But also in the shining of the gold."</article>

The more we enjoy, the more we will be saturated with His word.</article>

	<article author="Ben" email="" city="" provst="" country="Canada" month="1" day="21" year="2006">Brothers and sisters, we should all ask for the living-water and let the water in our hearts. Also we need to carry out the gospel to everyone, not just enjoy that by ourself, we need to preach out! Let everyone understand the kingdonm of God, the Bible saysâ€”when gospel preached unto all the nations, the end shall come!!! We are all chosen to preach the kingdom of God and express God Himself! We are all priests and prophets!!! Even a 10 year old kid if he received the Lord! When we are preaching, the Body of Christ is being built up, then when the Body is fully built up, He will come back!!!</article>
