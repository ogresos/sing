	<article author="Rosedel Rosas" email="" city="Iligan" provst="Lanao del Norte" country="Philippines" month="2" day="7" year="2009">"God delights in our loving Him, for this is good to Him. Just as it is profitable for us to believe in the Lord and have eternal life, so God wants us to love Him as well as to believe in Him; for loving Him is God's gain too." (Watchman N., Grace for grace)
1 John 2:15 says, "Do not love the world nor the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in him." For us to really forsake the world, we must have something better in our heart. God has not demanded that we cast away anything; He instead puts before us the more excellent. For the sake of possessing the more excellent, we naturally will forsake many lesser things. May we possess and love this excellent One - Christ.

Cebuano Translation of this hymn

Natugob's gugma
Lunhaw pa sa yamog
Dinhi malayo ko's yutan-ong butang
Malomong pagbati
Hapuhap's minahal
Labaw kang hiligugmaon ug matahum

Uban nimo pagkatam-is g'yud
Karon buot kong isulti kanimo
Gimahal ka nako
Magpabilin ko nimo
Sa tanan kong adlaw.

Di ko mapugngan
Kining gibati ko
Kay natilawan kong langitnong bino
Nahumol's gugma
Ibubo kong tanan
Kaugmaon ko ikaw ra Ginoo.</article>
