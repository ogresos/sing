    <article author="Rishie" email="rishie@dodo.com.au" city="Glen Innes" provst="NSW" country="Australia" month="2" day="3" year="2013">I think the thing I have most trouble with in my Christian walk is submission and obedience, letting go my control, my right to make my own choices, putting myself completely in the hands of and at the mercy of another. I really need help in this area, God, You know why I fear it, please help me Lord. Amen.</article>

    <article author="Almira Rarugal" email="" city="Navotas" provst="NCR" country="Philippines" month="10" day="14" year="2010">I like this song because it reminds me with my consecration before the Lord... That I would not care for my future anymore and I will give my whole being to Him. Lord, I give my whole future to You. I give myself to You to work in me fully that I may be a useful vessel before You.</article>
