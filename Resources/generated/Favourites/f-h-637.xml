    <article author="Isaiah Tor" email="" city="Sydney" provst="NSW" country="Australia" month="9" day="28" year="2008">This hymn describes with full poetically translated quality, the depths of human suffering, traversing the unpredictable intricacies of one's course in human life whilst "enbosomed" in the Lord's love. To "hug the shore" means seeking a "safe" course in life without abandoning the courses of our lives to the direction of the Lord's hand, taking Him daily as our Head. We escape suffering, mollify its effects by refusing to submit to the arrangement and discipline of the Spirit in ordering the trials of our lives (i.e. not being in spirit, but rather as Jacob struggling to have the comforts and security of life apart from Him). This hymn concerns not "heroes" but those who would see the "storm" as a "boon", whereby whilst suffering in trials we enjoy the Lord's "nursing" comfort to fully work Himself into us deeply and thoroughly, so that the "wreck" of our consumed outer man would under His renewing work be brought entirely under His "hand", under His full control, thus "anchored to Infinity"!</article>
