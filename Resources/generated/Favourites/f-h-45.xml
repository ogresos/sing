just tell the father ABBA FATHER WE ADORE THEE! I know that many out there just can't tell how rich and abundant the Lord's word is. You want to say something... but nothing comes out... THE LORD'S WORD IS JUST TOO GREAT TO SAY IN THE VERY WORDS OF HUMANS BECAUSE THE WORD OF THE LORD IS FAR BEYOND TIME AND SPACE AND BEYOND VAST-REACHING... THE VERY LORD IS OUR STRENGTH... HE IS WHAT CARRIES US ON ! PRAISE THE LORD SAINTS!</article>
