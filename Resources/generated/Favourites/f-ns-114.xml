I like the lyrics and the tune, but I find it rather difficult to sing along. This is a wonderful site, but it would be very very much better if there would be someone singing the hymn so it would be easy for newbies like me to follow. Just a little suggestion.</article>

May His mercy &amp; grace continue to reach day by day, so that we may continue to enjoy Him &amp; love Him whatever may be happening in our environment. Lord Jesus we lovely...we really love You!</article>
	<article author="Tom" email="" city="Milwaukee" provst="" country="" month="2" day="6" year="2014">I really enjoy the comments of Steve Miller throughout this website, helping us to enjoy the hymns more by providing historical context and great musical comments. Brother Steve, I believe Galatians 2:20 strongly supports "It's nothing I do". "It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me." Also in another portion Paul says: "I labored more abundantly than all of them - yet not I but the grace of God in me." So it is not that nothing is DONE. It is that what is done does not issue from ME. I died. A dead person can do nothing, by definition. So there is nothing for ME to do, I have turned it over to God and his mercy, for Him to do it all. You may enjoy the book "The Christian's Secret of a Happy Life" by Hannah Whitall Smith on this topic, or "The Overcoming LIfe" by Watchman Nee.</article>
	<article author="Chun Wang" email="wangmd@yahoo.com" city="Dallas" provst="Texas" country="" month="1" day="18" year="2014">In John chapter 6, the people wanted to do the work of God, but the Lord answered that the work of God is to believe in Him, that is to eat Him. Furthermore he who eats Him shall live by Him. It is not our doing, but His grace, Himself enjoyed by us, doing everything for us, in us, and through us.</article>

Nothing is quite so precious than Jesus in my spirit! Hallelujah! I love this song, for it paints a beautiful picture on how it is only the Lord's mercy that brings us out of everything into Himself, that is a life in resurrection... Praise the Lord! The Lord's grace be with your spirit!</article>
	<article author="Charles Hennessy" email="charles_hennessy@outlook.com" city="Tucson" provst="AZ" country="United States" month="5" day="10" year="2013">This song breathes rest in Christ to me. When we turn our heart to Him in response to His touching our heart, our mind, reminding us we haven't called on Him, breathed Him in (since when?), then He does in us what we really need and that is Him.</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="5" day="10" year="2013">The line in verse 2 "It's nothing I do" goes beyond the truth of the Bible. Is there any verse to support that? "It is not of me, but of God who shows mercy" (Rom 9:16) , but that doesn't mean that I shouldn't do anything or that what I do doesn't matter.</article>
	<article author="Sister Of Faith" email="" city="Fort Walton Beach" provst="Florida" country="United States" month="10" day="27" year="2011">It is me again!

This song is and will always be in my heart Trish and Crystal~I love you sisters~see you with Him someday!!! xoxoxooxoxoxoxo</article>
	<article author="Sister Of Truth!" email="" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="10" day="27" year="2011">In 1995, I met two incredible sisters in Christ! Their names were Trish Amason and Crystal Styles~they each had a way to touch the Spirit of Christ within me.</article>

	<article author="Boaz Lee" email="" city="Fairfax" provst="Virginia" country="United States" month="4" day="20" year="2010">He never leaves me,
E'en as the days grow weary.

	<article author="M.Grace Rodriguez" email="" city="San Juan" provst="M.M" country="Philippines" month="10" day="28" year="2009">This song reminds me of the preciousness of the Lord Jesus in my spirit, and I was reminded again that nothing in this world can satisfy me and meet my need but Him in my spirit. He as the Spirit in my spirit is so sufficient. Now, I am encourage to always turn to my mingled spirit by calling on Him.</article>
	<article author="Dora Yao" email="" city="Long Island" provst="NY" country="United States" month="9" day="24" year="2009">I learned this hymn many years ago, but it's not until now that I feel I have entered into the spirit of the hymn to really ponder and inhale each word and make it my own prayer. Oh Lord! Nothing is quite so precious!!!! How my soul delights to hide in Your arms....Lord Jesus!!! Help me in my weakness....so faithfully each day in me You prove Your life is so sufficient..Lord...bring this "endless joy" to me...</article>
	<article author="E.G." email="" city="" provst="NY" country="United States" month="6" day="25" year="2009">As I considered this thought - the value of something is usually what it is worth....I had to reconsider the things I treasure, what I spend my time on...The things that I consider to be so precious, if not on the Lord, it really becomes vanity.  I just considered when you know the value of something precious you will not hesitate to pay whatever the price is to obtain it.  Okay, what I'm trying to say is that I, just for a moment, had to re-evaluate our dear and precious Lord Jesus.  This hymn helped me to truly turn my heart to Lord and say....

Lord grant to me/us a fresh revelation of Yourself so that we would be willing to pay the price, whatever it may be, to experience and gain You. We want to really appreciate You and the process You went through in order to enter into our spirit.  But- O Lord, don't stop there, do spread and make Yourself at home in ALL our heart. Build us up together Lord.  

Upon this rock (not only the revelation of the church but also the revelation of Christ) He promised to build His church!!!</article>
	<article author="Darmel" email="" city="Round Rock" provst="TX" country="United States" month="10" day="28" year="2008">This hymn is a classic because the reality is that there is absolutely nothing quite so precious as this Man-Savior Jesus in our spirit! If you check your experience you will see that no one or nothing can compare to this precious Person living and dwelling within you.</article>
