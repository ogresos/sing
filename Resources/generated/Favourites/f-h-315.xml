He was 83 years old. They found him sitting in his chair, as though resting. He had gone to be with his Savior and Lord. On the floor at his feet was a sheet of paper. On one side of the paper he had written:
"Just as Thou wilt, Lord, this is my cry;
Just as Thou wilt, to live or die.
I am Thy servant; Thou knowest best;
Just as Thou wilt, Lord, labor or rest."
On the reverse side of the paper, in a hurried scrawl, was a second verse:
"Just as Thou wilt, Lord, which shall it be,
Life everlasting waiting for me,
Or shall I tarry here at Thy feet?
Just as Thou wilt, Lord, whatever is meet."
