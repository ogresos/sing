Clear every avenue of thought and brain,
Flood my affections, purify my will,
Let nothing but Thine own pure life remain.
Amen Lord break through our nature ! We want to only contain Your Spirit!</article>

	<article author="李 菲 麗" email="" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="5" day="16" year="2011">A very sweet, intimate hymn! "For the love of Christ constrains us because we have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died" (2 Corinthians 5:14). Praise the Lord that the love of Christ is so real and manifested to us through dying on the cross for us. It is not by our work, not our own will, but Christ's loving death is the motivating factor that constrains us to live a loving life for Him! Praise the Lord!</article>
	<article author="Ellen Fletcher" email="" city="Riverside" provst="Ohio" country="United States" month="10" day="16" year="2010">Brother Don, Emily May Grimes penned this song. You set me looking to see what other songs were ushered from her spirit... my what a treasure trove! Does anyone know WHEN this was written, before or after she married in Africa? I memorized this over 35 years ago and it has supplied, encouraged, opened, and constrained me and so many others through these years. Lord, thank You for the faithfulness of the Body building up the Body with, through and in Thy Mighty LOVE.</article>
	<article author="Don McLellan" email="" city="Brisbane" provst="Queensland" country="Australia" month="3" day="24" year="2008">This wonderful hymn so well captures the heart of a person who really wants God to use them to bless others. I memorised it some 40 years ago, but I do not know its author. Can anyone help me with that information?</article>
