	<article author="Regina" email="rpuck48@gmail.com" city="" provst="Al" country="United States" month="1" day="17" year="2016">When I lost my son and the pastor asked what do you need. I told him I needed a word. He quoted Romans 8:38-39 nothing in all creation can separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus. I couldn't believe it, there was no condemnation. Morning by morning new mercies I see. My son even had a tattoo. Psalm 23:4 yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for God is with me. Our family and many friends went and got the tattoo. God knew summer, winter, springtime and harvest we would need a constant reminder of his presence to cheer and guide us. Great is Thy faithfulness Lord unto me!</article>

	<article author="Deun Weekes" email="deunweekes@live.com" city="" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="11" day="18" year="2015">As I laid here this morning, I remember speaking to my niece yesterday who was diagnosed with stage 3 cancer and when I asked her how is it going, and she replied, "there WERE two lumps but they couldn't find any," I couldn't do anything but lift my hands to Heaven and hug her because God answered prayers. This morning this song came to my mind in the midst of laying here listening to The Message of The Cross on SBN and I couldn't remember the second verse onwards so I googled it and I praise God that His Holy Spirit had His way. This I believe is the Lord reminding me of His Compassion, Blessings, Faithfulness for He's not a man that He should lie nor the son of man that He should repent. Praise God, Hallelujah. I don't know who out there is reading this right now but know God can change your situation, He's already taken care of it through The Cross of Jesus Christ and Him Crucified, just believe, Be encouraged. 
  The blessing of the Lord , it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.

	<article author="Stewart" email="induna@aol.com" city="San Clemente" provst="CA" country="United States" month="11" day="18" year="2015">I was very "religious" until my early 20"s, I didn't derail but I certainly lost my faith, considering myself too smart or "scientific" to blindly accept God. I use to laugh at postings I see here, considering you hypocritical and ignorant. I was in control of my own destiny until I wasn't; God didn't exist until He did. I am not here to preach, but to thank God for not giving up on me for I am certainly unworthy — the last few months have been so powerful, I continue to struggle to some degree and then we have a tragedy, a sacrifice that unites and reawakens faith around the world and humble kid that sings His praise on our behalf.</article>
	<article author="L.M. Enoch" email="lisaenoch37@yahoo.com" city="Sheridan" provst="Arkansas" country="United States" month="11" day="17" year="2015">One more thing...i mentioned Jordan Smith singing this Gorgeous Hymn on "The Voice" last night.

	<article author="L.M. Enoch" email="lisaenoch37@yahoo.com" city="Sheridan" provst="Arkansas" country="United States" month="11" day="17" year="2015">God is the Most Faithful Creator! Last night on a television singing contest this song was sang by a man named Jordan Smith. It's no coincidence that this song was chosen. Many of us across the globe are grieving and praying compassionately for our fellow humans in Paris, Syria and every other place that is un-peaceful at this time in earth's His-Story! 1 Corinthians 10:13 says.."There bath no temptation (or tragedy) taken you but such is common to (all) man; but God is Faithful who will not allow you to be tempted (troubled) above that you are able; but will with the temptation(or trial) also make a way to Escape that you may be able to bare it!" Jesus Christ's Holy Spirit-Heaven in our heart (Luke 17:20-21) is where we can Escape to anytime anywhere we are! No matter what the enemy or anyone says or does!! God is in Control of His Universe!! And to Him Belongs all Glory! Amen!</article>

	<article author="Gail Catasus" email="" city="Melbourne" provst="Florida" country="United States" month="11" day="17" year="2015">As I sat before the Lord this morning this anointed song brought back memories of my grandmother playing on her piano and singing. As I reflect to the storms of life the Lord has carried us through many times I sang this song. Multiple times we will told by doctors the both of our sons would not be able to live. My husband and I would look into the faces of the doctors and nurses and explain to them we will never give up hope until God so chooses to either sustain our sons lives or take them home to be with him. Both of our sons now have defied all odds and are living testimony of God's intervention. As you listen to this song today cling to words and let it minister to the depths of your soul and whatever situation you're walking through.</article>

She was only 22 years old and had died the Saturday before after struggling more than 12 years against cancer. There was more than 500 people at this service, people who she knew and touched with her spirit and smile. I had never met her, but my wfe had transported her to school on her school bus many times and was definitely one of those who had been touched by her. You see, in spite of all her sufferings, Amanda was a joy to all those who knew her. Never complaining about her own pain, her concern was for how eveyone else felt. Very cheerful with an infectious smile, she was the one who cheered everyone else. Great sense of humor, loved her family, her schoolmates and her church groups. This hymn was played at the service and it was perfect for the occasion. God Bless!</article>

	<article author="Doug Rohl" email="" city="Calgary" provst="ABuja" country="Canada" month="3" day="31" year="2015">I belong to a church of the Pentecostal teaching. It makes me so sad and at times angry that this last Palm Sunday morning five songs with words and melody I nor anyone else in that small congregation had ever heard were sung. My Pastor is convinced that these songs or much more likely chants put to music will draw people.
No it will not. I repeat, no it will not.
If you do not specifically sing about Jesus,by name, the blood and the cross, if you do NOT praise the Lord, then nothing spiritual will happen.
At first singing this new age stuff was to draw the young. That did not work out so well, for a very long time we have not had a new, unsaved person enter our church.
Then it was, well we will sing ONE hymn ever. I am not going to be there for what you mistakenly call worship service. And even that has passed.
This week, I am going to tell the Pastor that if we do not start to sing the songs that have drawn millions to Christ, and begin to prioritize the time honored hymns, I will not be there to sing stuff with words that do not stir my heart or anyone else. I will find a place near the building, turn on my portable cd player and listen to what I KNOW heals a troubled heart.</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="3" day="16" year="2015">George Beverly Shea in "How Sweet the Sound":
At Moody Bible Institute I met the composer of this song, Mr. William Runyan. A tall, delightful gentleman in his 70's, Mr. Runyan taught piano and voice in the fine music department there.
We became good friends; it was an honor for me to spend time with Mr. Runyan and learn from him, for he was well-versed in hymnology. I was so pleased when he would call me at the radio department and say, "When you have an opportunity, come over. I'd like to play for you a new song I'm working on." He had great talent for writing inspiring music. This man's enthusiasm was incredible. He was always victorious and happy in the Lord. 
Thomas Chisholm was born in a log cabin in Kentucky and wrote more than 1200 poems. In 1923, he sent the words of this hymn to Mr. Runyan. Upon reading these words, Mr. Runyan knew he had received a precious message that could touch lives around the world. He prayed that God would help him compose music that was uplifting and joyous. God answered that prayer. This hymn of praise has become a great favorite with congregations everywhere.
Cliff Barrows and I had an opportunity to meet Thomas Chisholm, at a senior care center. We found him seated on a park bench and talked with him for a little while. What a dear soul! He could have been thinking about his divinely-inspired words as he sat there under the trees: "Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow. Blessings all mine with 10,000 beside!"
"O God my Father," Your love has never failed me. Through each season of my life, You have been present. Thank You for Your faithfulness.</article>

	<article author="Bette Day" email="bette2day@uneedus.com" city="Orlando" provst="FL" country="United States" month="3" day="13" year="2015">If you have ever read any books written by Karen Kingsbury, you will know that this is a song that is referred to many times in her writings. She is an awesome author of Christian fiction. Follow the Baxter family through the many trials and tribulations that every person faces during their lifetime. No matter what happens, they pray and sing together and listen for the still small voice of God speaking to them. I highly recommend these books as a way to know that God is with us no matter what we are going through or where we are. Surely "He is Faithful."</article>

I realized the little things that God asked for I was lacking, commitment, baby dedicated, and inviting a preacher to simply give my husband and I a few blessing. And also remaining faith. It seems like I wanted everything else except God's will, my God has been so good to me from day 1, and years later after of all the bad things we may have done my God is still faithful. Faithful with His blessing, mercies and many more. I needed those words this morning.
“Great is Thy faithfulness!” “Great is Thy faithfulness!“

All I have needed Thy hand hath provided—
    “Great is Thy faithfulness,” Lord, unto me</article>

This is the 4th day since my beloved Muffin has died. 

As my heart ached, I cried out to The Lord. The words "every morning new mercies I see keep coming into my mind". Then my body experienced a slow rush of warmth, comfort, sweetness, healing, and soothing filling to my entire being, lasting over a minute, covering my heartache and grief, giving my rest in precious time. The Lord is faithful indeed. "If He causes grief, then He will have compassion according to His abundant lovingkindness." Lamentations 3:32 

Glory be to God the Highest, my Lord!
Glory be to God the Highest, for He is faithful and full of mercies!
Glory be to God the Highest, praises to Him forever!</article>

He is forever faithful, in our short-comings, our highs and lows, I especially thank Him for ever being there in time of distress, heart break, hurts, pains, and joy, laughter and anxieties. In my waiting, for His faithfulness to be accomplished in my areas of needs, I gently and humbly hold on to the tip of Your faithful garment. And with the assurance that He will show up, even at the ninetieth hour. GOD You are truly faithful.</article>

Despite our self indulgent nature and life styles, He never ceases to amaze me—He is so faithful that He comes looking for me every morning therefore proving His mercy for me. Remember, they are NEW! While we spend time reflecting on our wrongs and failures and however undeserving we are of His mercy and unforgiveness, God says, faithfully, My mercy is new, today! I cannot wait to be in my Creators' presence! I thank Him today for my underserving 48 years on this Earth! Friend, don't give up on Him...this hymn is a constant reminder that He has NOT and NEVER WILL give up on you and me!!! Amen.</article>

	<article author="Jeff" email="" city="Harleysville" provst="PA" country="United States" month="1" day="6" year="2013">“GREAT IS THY FAITHFULNESS” is one of my favorite songs and we never sing it enough! This song says what I can't express in my own words. The LORD has provided me more than I could possibly ask or even imagine. "I have been young and now I'm old and I have never seen the righteous forsaken, nor his descendants begging for bread." (Psalms 37:25)
Great indeed is His faithfulness! I've learned over the years of my life that God's timing is always perfect. When you wait for Him, even in the midst of uncertainty, He will always be with you.
As I look back over 70+ years, I can truly say that God has been faithful to me! It is easy to look at the things around me that I don't have and grumble. But, when I really take time to reflect, I see how His hand has been at work...... guiding, directing, supplying, blessing, year after year, He remains so faithful, and He keeps me in the palm of His hand, where no one can remove me. 
Lord, I love You, worship You, and I give You thanks and praise and honor for what You have done for me. LORD You truly are faithful. 
Thank You Lord for loving me and being my Redeemer!</article>

He is a Christian and an excellent computer programmer, but downsizing and a thing called "unemployment discrimination" worked against him. During that time he lost his condo and all contents; he became homeless and lived in his car. On July 24, 2012, he started a new job and was able to move into a motel. he immediately instituted a program of debt reduction and declared a year of austerity. In November (?) he moved into a new condo. I thank the Lord that He saw us through this heart wrenching time. Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto us!

"Because of the Lord's great love, we are not consumed, for His compassions never fail. They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness."

Sometimes we come to work and it feels like there is a brick wall – nothing is going right, or so it seems. We may not be at the point of giving up, but the thought crosses our mind before we chase it away.

In the midst of all the struggles, drama, and hard work, we remember why we are here. We remember what God calls us to do. We remember that we are certainly not alone, but His presence and power and promises equip us.

And like God refreshed Isaiah after his confrontation with Jezebel when Isaiah was tapped out, God also refreshes us. He allows us rest, He ministers to us, and His Word gives us strength and encouragement.

Each day then brings afresh a new message of God's mercy. We can say with Jeremiah:
"Because of the Lord's great love, we are not consumed, for His compassions never fail. They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness."

We can sing the great hymn of faith:
Great is Thy faithfulness, O God my Father.</article>

The dream was of a flood up to the neck of people in the water and all of a sudden after I had wondered how I was going to cross. Immediately the water started receding very swiftly. Then someone started singing this song and I joined in singing at the top of my voice. Woke up and realised I didnt know the lyrics apart from the first lines of the chorus...so! It ministered to me of God's unchanging love and mercies every day!!</article>

	<article author="J. Jeffrey Zetto" email="" city="Houston" provst="Texas" country="United States" month="6" day="30" year="2012">While many of our congregations will sing patriotic songs this Sunday (1 July) or next, this hymn is a setting of Lamentations 3, Jeremiah's "patriotic song" in the context of Israel's behavior 600 years before Jesus. The "lament" is a classical form of Hebrew poetry: identifying woe, acknowledging sin, and here confessing faith in God's grace, forgiveness, and restoration. An excellent message for us today and tomorrow.</article>

	<article author="Reesie" email="" city="Jacksonville" provst="FL" country="United States" month="5" day="12" year="2012">I love this song and miss hymns being sung in church. I hope church music directors will see these comments and see that we are starving for hymns that were written by the annointing of the Holy Spirit. They have SO MUCH MORE meansing that singing the same phrase over and over and over and the new music is usually us singing about ourselves and what we're doing instead of singing about the Lord Jesus' and Jehovah God the Father's AWESOME POWER, MIGHT, JUSTICE, KINDNESS, FAITHFULNESS, etc! I read the comments here and was moved to tears seeing comments from people all over the world who are searching, hungry for hymns. And reading Betty's comments about her son and how GOD answered her prayers and brought reconciliation. My faithful, beautiful mother went on to be with the Lord in Heaven on April 1 and I am so grateful and thankful that she suffers no more with dementia and health problems and being helpless anymore. She is young, healthy, happy, and with the ONE who never left her nor forsook her. Her life was a witness, especially in her weakness, to the Lord and my brother got saved because of it. Praise to the Almight God, The Great I AM, Immovable Rock, Omnipotent, Powerful, Awesome Lord!!!! God bless you all and I'll meet you all one day in Heaven with the Lord and my Mother and all those believers who've gone before us, and those who have suffered persecution and death for the name of the Lord Jesus.</article>

I hurried everyone into the woods to hide, but just before entering the woods I told them enter God's Rest and Faithfulness removed my shoes and stood shaking singing this song as they passed by without seeing us at arms length! I am a Baptist Social Justice Missionary and disciple of Christ who believes in God's grace and power today; which stands against all science and logic when God chooses to work His mercy today! My atheist friend and Muslim companion asked me why I continued to cry after they had passed? Yet still shaking I told them the presence of the Lord is upon me and I feel so unworthy and shameful! They both said, but why...because I had both believed and doubted and the angel told me your prayer was answer because of mercy and humbleness it is a witness unto you for your companions! God Bless Everyone....the only thing I can say is when there is no escape plead mercy and sing unto God.</article>

	<article author="Linga Marful" email="" city="Accra" provst="" country="Ghana" month="6" day="12" year="2011">My pastor sang this wonderful hymn today after his sermon and since I didn't know the words decided to use the internet to search for it.
I have been a Christian all my life but it wasn't until I lost everything I had worked hard for that I really came to know God and gave my life to Him. I will be 47 on July 3rd and lived and worked in London for 13yrs and decided to come back home and start my own business. I thought I had it all. Life was really great and even though I was a Christian (had been all my life) I had not committed myself to God and accepted Jesus as my Saviour until ny business and fortunes hit the rocks and I lost everything but found Jesus. I can't stop telling the world how happy I am now. His mercies are abundant in my life. I don't leave to count my money or treasures but now I leave for Him in love and count my blessings in His holy name. The words of this song touched my heart so much that for the first time in my life I wanted to testify to the Lord for His faithfulness and blessings in my life. Thank You Jesus for Your glory. I can't leave another day without giving You the glory. Thanks be to God. Amen.</article>

	<article author="Barry Satchell" email="" city="Dondingalong" provst="New South Wales" country="Australia" month="6" day="8" year="2011">There is not enough space here to share the way God has been faithful to me in the 72 years of my life! Early this morning I sat, preparing a sermon called "The faithfulness of God" in which I recall some of the incidents of His faithfulness to me. My testimony is that it is impossible to outgive God!! Give Him your life in humble service and He will just pour on the blessings. Sometimes life can be very difficult and circumstances very discouraging. Those are the times that our Father uses to perfect our faith! He doesn't cause them, but He certainly uses them. If we trust Him in those times, we learn that His love never fails, and we look back and see why He lead us as He did.
If you are young in the faith, take it from an old fellow who has lived both sides of life - the life of serving self and the life of serving God for 40 years. Not only is it safe to trust Him, it is a truly amazing and fulfilling journey. He will never fail you if you trust Him completely.
Obviously the author of this hymn experienced the same thing. God bless you friend! Look me up in heaven and tell me your story!</article>

Oh there is such joy in my heart when I realize He is real, He is faithful and He hears all my cries. My soul longeth for Him. He fails not. I started singing it aloud and I didn't care if it woke up anyone!</article>

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="7" day="31" year="2011">Although we are unfaithful, God is faithful. Lamentations 3:23b says, "Great is Your faithfulness." The chorus of a well-known hymn on God's faithfulness (Hymns, #19) says, "'Great is Thy faithfulness!' 'Great is Thy faithfulness!' / Morning by morning new mercies I see; / All I have needed Thy hand has provided—/ 'Great is Thy faithfulness,' Lord, unto me!" We may understand what the Bible says and what this hymn says about God's faithfulness either in a natural way or in a spiritual way. When you sing this hymn, how do you understand the word faithfulness? If you understand God's faithfulness in a natural way, you may think that He is faithful primarily in the matter of material provisions or physical blessings. When some say that God is faithful, they mean that He is faithful to take care of their material needs. However, in 1 Corinthians 1:9 Paul says, "God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord." God is faithful in this matter, but He may not be faithful to provide you a large house or a well-paying job. I would not deny the fact that God is faithful in caring for our welfare. My point is that God's faithfulness is not according to our natural understanding.

Consider the sufferings of the apostle Paul. He was called, commissioned, burdened, and sent by God, but wherever he went he had troubles. For example, as soon as he began to preach Christ, he began to suffer persecution. He even had to escape from Damascus by being lowered down the wall in a basket. Does this mean that God was not faithful to Paul? No, it means that God's faithfulness is not according to our natural understanding.

When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we might have expected to have peace and blessing. But instead we might have had many troubles and might have lost our security, our health, or our possessions. When some Christians experience such things, they may question God's faithfulness and ask why He did not prevent hardships from happening to them.

We need to realize that in allowing us to have troubles, God is faithful in His purpose to turn us from idols and bring us back to Himself. Our peace, safety, health, and possessions may become idols to us, and God is faithful to take these things away so that we may drink of Him as the fountain of living waters. If our house or our possessions become idols to us, we drink of them and not of God. God's faithfulness is a matter of dealing with these idols and causing us to drink of Him.

God is faithful in leading us into His economy, and His economy is for us to drink Christ, to eat Christ, to enjoy Christ, to absorb Christ, and to assimilate Christ that God may have His increase with us to fulfill His economy. This is God's faithfulness.

Instead of drinking of God as the fountain of living waters, Israel drank of their idols. Therefore, God used the Babylonians to deal with these idols and also to destroy Jerusalem and even the temple, which had become an idol to them. We need to see that we are not better than Israel. Anything can become an idol to us. But God is faithful in fulfilling His economy. In His faithfulness He deals with our idols that we may drink of Him. We all need to drink of God as the fountain of living waters, receiving Christ into us and assimilating Him, so that He may increase for the fulfillment of God's economy to have His expression through His counterpart.

Whereas God is faithful, we are neither faithful nor chaste but go to many other husbands. After failing God, we may receive some mercy and grace and therefore repent and weep, saying, "How pitiful I am! For a long time I have not loved the Lord very much, and I have not attended the meetings." While we are repenting and weeping, God is rejoicing. However, if we repent and weep too much, even our repentance may become an idol. We may testify in a meeting, saying that we have thoroughly repented to God. But this may be a matter of self-boasting and be a self-made idol. Therefore, after repenting, we should begin to drink of the living waters, praising God, giving thanks to Him for everything, and enjoying Him. This is what God wants. God is not interested in anything other than our enjoyment of Christ.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="7" day="31" year="2011">Jeremiah's speaking in Lamentations 3:22-26 is another pattern of prophesying: "It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not. They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness. The Lord is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him. The Lord is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him. It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord." Jeremiah told us that it is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed. This is not foretelling but blessing, well-speaking. He told us that the mercies, the compassions, of the Lord are new every morning. We need to learn to prophesy in this way. Jeremiah told the Lord, "Great is thy faithfulness." There is a well-known hymn based upon this verse (Hymns, #19). Jeremiah also said that the Lord was his portion. It is marvelous that there was a prophet in the Old Testament who knew that the Lord was his portion. When we tell others that the Lord is our portion, we are speaking the Lord to them.
