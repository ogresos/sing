He resigned that position to become an ordained Presbyterian minister of the Gospel. Mackay was a staunch believer that the Word of God means what it says. This quote from one of his publications is an example of his straightforward, no nonsense Gospel message of grace and commitment: "Creed, or the belief in a certain amount of doctrine, has made Christendom, but never made a Christian. Ye must be born again."
Some of Mackay's writings are still in print today: Abundant Grace: Selected Address (1885) and The Seeking Saviour and Other Bible Themes (1904). He is remembered best for one of his hymns, Revive Us Again. - sharefaith

The 1st line of this hymn in the original, which is the song's title, is: 
The Lord is risen: the Red Sea's judgment flood

The Brethren hymnal uses the tune of #950, "And is it so", to sing this song. Both tunes work well, but each gives a different feeling.

Here is MacKay's testimony of his conversion:
My dear mother had been a Godly, holy woman, quite often telling me of the Savior, and many times I saw her on bended knee in prayer for my soul’s salvation. But nothing had made a deep impression on me. The older I grew, the more wicked I became…

One day a seriously injured man was brought into the hospital. His case seemed hopeless, he seemed to realize his condition for he was fully conscious and asked me how much time he had left to live. I gave him my opinion in as cautious a manner as I could.

“Have you any relatives whom we could notify?” I asked.

The patient shook his head. He had only one wish, it was to see his landlady because he owed her a small sum of money and also wished to bid her farewell. He also requested that his landlady send him “The Book…”

I went to see him on my regular visits at least once a day. What struck me most was the quiet, almost happy expression constantly on his face…After the man died, some things about his affairs were to be done in my presence.

“What shall we do with this?” the nurse asked holding a book in her hand.

“What kind of book is it?” I asked.

“The Bible of the poor man…As long as he was able to read it, he did so, and when he was unable to do so anymore, he kept it under his bed cover.”

I took the Bible and-could I trust my eyes? It was my own Bible! The Bible which my mother had given me when I left my parent’s home, and which later, when short of money, I sold for a small amount. My name was still in it, written in my mother’s hand…

With a deep sense of shame I looked upon the precious Book. It had given comfort and refreshing to the unfortunate man in his last hours. It had been a guide to him into eternal life, so that he had been enabled to die in peace and happiness. And this book, the last gift to me from my mother, I had actually sold for a ridiculous price…

Be it sufficient to say that the regained possession of my Bible was the cause of my conversion. - maranatha777</article>
