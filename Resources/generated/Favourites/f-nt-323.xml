The melody is both sad and hopeful at the same time. It is as if this very delightful hymn takes us on a spirit filled journey that never ends...</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="10" day="5" year="2013">Horatius Bonar loved to doodle as he wrote his hymns. On the sheet where this hymn first took shape, the lines are abbreviated, edited, and added to, and several doodles are scratched in the margins. Many of Bonar's ideas came to him during long country walks in his native Scotland, and he often fleshed out his ideas while riding a train. All told, Bonar wrote more than 600 hymns and became known as "the prince of Scottish hymnwriters."
Bonar was a brilliant Bible scholar, an outstanding devotional writer, and an active church leader. He knew how to communicate profound truths to children through hymns. In doing so he helped adults to understand as well. The invitation of Christ to "come" is simple enough for a child to respond to. But after accepting that invitation, it takes a lifetime to probe the depths of what it means to come to Him, to drink the living water, and to walk in the Light. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>

In Him we find all we have need of. Such a healing, peaceful song.</article>
