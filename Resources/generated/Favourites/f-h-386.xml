	<article author="Kelechi Idimogu" email="kelechiidimogu@yahoo.com" city="Abuja" provst="Federal Capital Territory" country="Nigeria" month="5" day="21" year="2016">After being alone with God yesterday, this was the song that came to my spirit this morning so I sang it. It's my regular companion when I want to commune with Him even when I'm in the car and each time I play it, I feel His presence more. It inspires me and helps me to remember that Christ lives in me and this is the only hope of glory. It's an encouragement for a more intimate relationship with the Lord.</article>

	<article author="Hope Yoloye" email="livingway@email.com" city="London" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="1" day="11" year="2016">Blessings of the Lord to both my parents who took me to Church regularly as a child and sent me to Christian governed Schools in my formative years until I went to professional training institution. I am very grateful to Dr. Ezekiel Funso Omowo who, by the Spirit leading conveyed to me what it means to be a Christian; and I am forever grateful to God for my Pastor, Choir Master and Mentor, Revd. Gabriel Farombi who raised me up as young believer and pushed me hard to be really a responsible and accountable Christian. 
I don't remember where I first learned this awesome and inspiring song in my pilgrimage so far, it was somewhere in my journey above. Today, I have been reading Ezra 8, then referred to Esther 1 for some reason, then back to Ezra 8, when I was reminded again that everything that pertains to life and fruitfulness can ONLY be due to God's presence. Leading me to unearth this timeless hymn in my depth and search for its full lyrics. A lot better, more spiritual and more meaningful than the current psychedelic Christian songs, I would agree.
My confession: You are my everlasting Portion, Jesus Christ. 
My Prayer: Please let me CLOSELY WALK WITH YOU. Amen!</article>

	<article author="Ugoji Nwaeke" email="pastorugoji.nta@gmail.com" city="Jos" provst="Plateau" country="" month="3" day="17" year="2015">What a challenge, if a blind woman - Fanny Jane Crosby could do this ever inspiring, timeless and ageless song for the Lord since the 17th century, may we all ask ourselves what legacy we are leaving behind in the sands of time as we go.
Fanny has been resting in the bosom of the master she loved so much, while the impact of her work while here on earth continues to affect generation after generation for our Lord Jesus Christ.
May the Lord help us and our generation to serve him as these old saints did. Amen.</article>

	<article author="Anita Igberaese" email="anita.igberaese@gmail.com" city="Lagos" provst="" country="Nigeria" month="10" day="18" year="2013">My mum loved hymns so much! But she is singing forever more in God's presence now...
I was thinking of her and missing her when I decided to google search her, and found that she came to this site. Wasn't surprised that it was a hymn site. But what more, it was comforting and somewhat bitter-sweet to see this was the hymn she listened to.
Indeed, God was her everlasting Portion, and more than friend or life to her. And along her pilgrim journey, Jesus our Savior, walked with her...

Hallelujah for such hope in eternal life. Miss you so much Mum... You are among the cloud of witnesses now... I long to be with Jesus, my Savior and you too, when the time comes...

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="6" day="18" year="2013">A Scottish minister once told Fanny Crosby that it was too bad that God had allowed her to become blind. Crosby quickly responded, "If I had been given a choice at birth, I would have asked to be blind ... for when I get to heaven, the first face I will see will be the one who died for me." That desire to see Jesus, to be close to Him, was always foremost in her mind.
When Silas Jones Vail, who was a Long Island hatter by trade, said he had a tune for Crosby, she asked him to play it for her. As he was playing it, Crosby said, "That refrain said 'Close to Thee, close to Thee, close to Thee, close to Thee.'" -Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>
