Loving through a stormy way,
Even when my faith is small,
Loving Jesus that is all.

Thank You, Lord Jesus for always bringing me back to my first love and the simplicity of loving You. Praise You Lord that a stormy way does not negate my inner man, where You dwell. Thank You I only need to have a little faith and then You faithfully bring me back to the Tree of Life where I can freely love You and enjoy You as my life supply. Bring us all back to our first love every day and keep us loving You, Oh Lord Jesus, that is all.</article>
