The saving power of the Lamb of God has once again being revealed by this hymn. This hymn reminds me of the revelation of the Apostle John in the book of Revelation where he saw that the saints overcame the adversary with the blood of the lamb. That the we are saved only the precious blood of the LORD JESUS shall remain the only TRUTH IN TIME AND ETERNITY. When we enter the celestial city, all the saints shall sing this hymn to the glory of the LORD JESUS.</article>

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="31" year="2008">Christ is the object of the believers' remembrance for them to eat and drink, declaring His death until He comes. In 1 Corinthians 11:26 Paul tells us that at the Lord's supper we "eat this bread and drink the cup." The bread and the cup are the elements of the Lord's supper, a feast, set up by Him so that we, His believers, may remember Him by enjoying Him as such a feast. This means that we should remember the Lord by eating and drinking Him. At the Lord's supper we partake of the bread and the cup as the symbols of His body and His blood in order to enjoy Him. It is by eating, drinking, and enjoying the Lord that we remember Him. The following stanza of Hymns, #233 speaks of this:

We long to eat and drink e'en more,
To take Thyself in spirit thus,
Till Thou shalt all our being fill
And true remembrance have from us.

The more we eat, drink, and enjoy Him, the more we render Him the true remembrance. To remember the Lord is not merely to recall that Christ is God who became a man, lived as a carpenter, and was persecuted, arrested, judged, and crucified. Rather, to remember Him is to eat and drink Him, to enjoy Him. In other words, we do not remember the Lord by using our mind to meditate about the Lord; instead, we remember the Lord by exercising our spirit to feed on Him. Our remembering the Lord in such a way declares to the whole universe that we daily enjoy Him as our food and drink. He is our feast, our enjoyment.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="27" year="2008">The second crucial element of the Bible is Christ. Generally, the initial knowledge of Christians concerning Christ is that He is the Savior (Luke 2:11), the One who is full of love and compassion to save them from hell. After a little reading of the Bible, they may know Him further as the Redeemer (Matt. 20:28), who died and shed His blood on the cross as a ransom for many to satisfy God's righteous requirements (1 Pet. 1:18-19; Rev. 1:5b). However, it is not enough to know Christ only to this extent. In addition to knowing Christ as the Savior and Redeemer, we must know Him to a deeper degree, that is, that He is our life and He is also in us to be united and mingled with us. In John 15:5 the Lord Jesus said, "I am the vine; you are the branches. He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit." It is a mystery that we abide in the Lord and He abides in us. It is difficult for human language to describe this mysterious union. Just as we abide in the air, and the air also abides in us, today because the Lord is the Spirit, we can abide in the Lord and the Lord can also abide in us. What a miracle! What a mystery! The Lord abides in us and is united and mingled with us! Stanza 1 of Hymns, #233 says, "O what a miracle, my Lord,/That I'm in Thee and Thou in me,/That Thou and I are really one;/O what a wondrous mystery!"
