This resurrection life supplies us and strengthens us into our inner man. It is ever new and RENEWS us constantly! 
Really enjoyed from yesterday's prayer meeting that, we are called by the Lord when we're saved, but Christ wants us to be the CALLING ones every moment of every day! Oh Lord Jesus! I love You! Remind me to call on You all the time!</article>
