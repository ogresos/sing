    <article author="Hymnal.net" city="" provst="" country="" month="12" day="6" year="2012">The problem with many saints is that they look only at their weaknesses, and as a result, they collapse. I once told a brother not to ask the saints to sing the hymn "O Lord, Shine and Shine on Me" (hymn #326 in Chinese). The saints do not need to look at themselves, nor do they need more shining, because they are not able to rise up. If the members in a Christian group are confused, quarreling, and fleshy, then they will need to sing, "O Lord, shine and shine on me." Among us, however, some saints know that they are fleshly, in the self, and cold toward the Lord; hence, they do not need to look at their weaknesses. The more they look at themselves, the more incompetent they will feel, and the colder they will become. We cannot rise up, because we do not apply the law of revival.

Therefore, we should never stay focused on our weaknesses. The weaknesses that we discover should only enable us to see an aspect of Christ for us to experience. When we gaze upon Christ, who is newly revealed to us in a particular characteristic, we will be enlivened within and revived. After we experience Christ in this way, we will not care about our weaknesses. Instead, we will look directly at our goal, the Christ who is able to supply us richly in all things and solve all our problems. Then we will be revived and experience another cycle of revival. When we see a weakness, we should immediately look at Christ. Then we will experience another revival. This is the law of revival. If we see this law clearly, whenever we are down and discover a weakness, we can receive Christ according to our weakness and enter into a new revival.
