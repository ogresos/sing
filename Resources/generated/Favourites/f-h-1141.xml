	<article author="" email="" city="New York City" provst="NY" country="U.S.A." month="4" day="22" year="2003">Recently, I realized how simple and yet how meaningful this hymn is. The key to seeing/experiencing Christ as our reality, as our LAND is to turn to our spirit! Since we have the Lord in our spirit...this allows us to spend time with Him and most importantly, to enjoy Him as anything and everything b/c He is the all-inclusive Christ! The Christian life, typified by the Feast of Unleavened Bread - which the children of Israel had for 7 days, should be a life of feasting. If we feel that we no longer experience anything new of Him, we can honestly tell Him our situation...ask Him to be more real to us...to make our time with Him sweeter and more enjoyable. Christ wants to be enjoyable to us!</article>
