Thank God for Jesus. Amen. Thanks for uploading this song and God bless you all.</article>

	<article author="Henrich Brockhaus" email="henrich.brockhaus@wwu.edu" city="Bellingham" provst="Washington" country="United States" month="1" day="19" year="2015">I like the "plonky" approach, it makes it a lot easier to sing along when one isn't so sure about the tune.</article>
	<article author="Tom" email="" city="Milwaukee" provst="" country="" month="11" day="28" year="2014">Perhaps you could re-record with a more upbeat rendering like "I'm walking down the road"? Evelyn, please check out that piano part, really excellent.

	<article author="Evelyn Sims" email="evelynsims111@gmail.com" city="North Strathfield" provst="NSW" country="Australia" month="10" day="3" year="2014">I love the hymn but am sad the playing is so "plonky" rather than with beautiful chords and smooth in the style of Ted Smith of the Billy Graham Crusades. Many of the lovely older hymns on You tube tend to be plonky and make them sound childish.</article>

	<article author="Peter Mugoiyo" email="mugoiyo@yahoo.com" city="Nairobi" provst="" country="Kenya" month="7" day="24" year="2014">Hallelujah! Yeah, I love Jesus Christ, the Son of the Living God for having rescued me from the most dangerous and dark pit of sin where Satan, the devil, old serpent and who is also the dragon had chained me. My loving Christ and Saviour came to my rescue by atoning me with His own precious and priceless blood at the place called of the skull (Golgotha) where He redeemed me and broke all the shackles that had bound me, and He exclaimed, "Peter G. Mugoiyo, my friend, and to all the souls in the whole-wide world: IT IS FINISHED!" Glory to the Almighty Elohim, our most loving Father, and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ now and forever. Indeed, Jesus is the sinnerâ€™s perfect plea. Hallelujah!</article>

It reminds me of the days, in the 80's, when my late mum will lead in their local church back in Western Kenya. Surely, I love to hear the name of JESUS because He died for me. Let us desire to hear this name. It is a strong tower under which the righteous run unto it and they are safe.</article>
