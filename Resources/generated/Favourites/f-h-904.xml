"The work, it is His and not mine;" Lord remind us that You are the One working out Your marvelous plan and we just need to abide in You; be our source and supply! Make us ones that cooperate with You through You and unto You!</article>

The work is His and not mine;
He plans and prepares it for me
And fills me with power divine.
So duty is changed to delight,
And prayer into praise as I sing.
Dear Lord Jesus, my king,
I dwell with you for Your work,
And work in the strength of You!</article>

In fact, He loves in our trials to share. We really do have a most glorious King.</article>
