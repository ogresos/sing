How we turned from idols, to the Living God, initially loving Him with our whole being, forgetting the world, even forgetting ourselves, only enjoying His Presence so much! Now this hymn brings us back to The Lord as our focus, from all other focuses, like work for The Lord, and different concerns. Thank You Lord! Amen.</article>

	<article author="Andrea Benoit" email="abenoit@comcast.net" city="Puyallup" provst="WA" country="United States" month="1" day="19" year="2013">I've been in such need of Peace - I read this morning in the Conclusion Messages by Witness Lee this excerpt: "The peace of God and the God of peace are one. When God is with us, peace is with us also. The genuine peace we enjoy is God Himself. The way to enjoy the God of peace is by praying to have fellowship with Him." This brought me to this wonderful hymn.</article>
