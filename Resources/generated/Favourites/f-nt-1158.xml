	<article author="Ruth" email="" city="" provst="" country="Canada" month="3" day="6" year="2015">As soon as I try to sing these precious words the tears fall down my cheeks, my heart wells with Love for our Jesus. O dear Jesus. I think of Watchman Nee composing these lyrics, persecuted, facing imprisonment, possible torture and the words he penned carry the truth of his testimony. To sing this song is very humbling. How Jesus loved him and blessed him with His precious love.

Ephesians 3:14-21:
14 For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 15 Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, 16 That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; 17 That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, 18 May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; 19 And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God. 20 Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, 21 Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.</article>

It is wonderful that despite all the difficulties we encounter, whether because of the flesh or by trial, something still holds us to keep us going on and not give up. The Lord never give us up! We cannot change in standing because He Himself cannot. What a grace!</article>

 Every pride hath disappeared.
All I long for is Thy pleasure,
 And the peace Thy love would bring.
All I yearn for is Thy coming
 And Thy presence’ sweet embrace.
Thou art all that I desire,
 Nothing else I would pursue.
Matchless One, unrivaled beauty,
 None can e’er compete with Thee.</article>
