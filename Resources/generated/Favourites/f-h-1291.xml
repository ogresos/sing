And our many troubles &amp; trials can even make the highways to Zion a valley of weeping. But hallelujah! When we pass through this valley of Baca, our God makes this valley into a spring! And this spring is the Spirit! Praise the Lord!</article>

We are safe from the enemy when we are joined to the Body. Alone, we cannot experience the whole armor of God but together we are strong and Satan is unable to sift thru the Body of Christ. Hallelujah! more and more may we lose our independent nature and cleave to the saints for there is our protection.</article>

It's not by us but by Him that we are supplied in all situations and be kept from the enemy's sifting! Thank You, Lord!</article>

I pledge to stand by someone in this battle so by the grace of God, together we'll never sift through.</article>

The key for that is "together"! The church is much too big to sift through! Hallelujah!</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="8" day="21" year="2010">At our home meeting we were discussing the sifting in Luke 22. I said, There's a song in the supplemental part of our hymnal about that, but how could we find it. I said, Probably it is in the section on the church, so I opened my hymnal to go to that section, and I saw that I had opened right to this song, which is the one I was looking for. It is in the Spiritual Warfare section appropriately, not the church section. We sung the song, and I received timely encouragement by it.

The 1st verse and the chorus are very good. 

Verses 2-3 are not according to the truth. Christians need companions, but just because you stick together with another Christian doesn't mean you won't get sifted out.</article>
