	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="Michigan" country="United States" month="7" day="10" year="2016">Frances Havergal was born at the Rectory, Astley, Worcester, England. Her father was Rector there. Five years later they moved to the beautiful city of Worcester, where her father was Dean of the Cathedral. She tells us that when she was about 5 she told the minister that she was troubled about her sins, but he did not know how to help her. He told her that her feelings were caused by her having moved away from Astley, with all the beautiful surroundings there for a little girl to enjoy. She did not mention her feelings to anyone again for several years. At the age of 13 or 14 she went to a boarding school conducted by a most Godly lady, Mrs. Teed. Several girls in the school were converted and testified to the joy they found in the Lord. Frances confided in Mrs. Teed about her feelings, and that she so wanted the Lord Jesus in her life, too. Mrs. Teed referred her to a Miss Cooke, who wisely asked, ""Why can you not trust yourself to your Savior at once?" Miss Havergal said: "Then a flash of hope came across me, which made me feel literally breathless. I remember how my heart beat. 'I could surely,' was my response. I ran upstairs. I flung myself on my knees. I was very happy at last. I committed my soul to my Savior. I do not mean to say without any trembling or fear - but I did - and earth and heaven seemed bright from that moment - I did trust the Lord Jesus."
Miss Havergal wrote: "Trusting Thee! For Thee! That is the end of the whole matter of consecration. 'The Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me.' I realized it was 'for me;' it is then practical to say, 'for Thee.' 'For Thee.' this makes the difference between slave labor and free work. For Thee, my Redeemer; for Thee, Who hast spoken to my heart; for me!"
She passed away at Swansea, Wales, in her 43rd year. She exclaimed, "It is all perfect peace. I am only waiting for Jesus to take me in."
The great missionary to China, Dr. J. Hudson Taylor, said that his favorite hymn, after he was able to trust the Lord for his complete salvation, was ""I am Trusting Thee, Lord Jesus" by Frances Havergal. Her consecration hymn, "Take My Life and Let it Be" is considered one of the greatest hymns ever written. - 'Hymn Stories' by Wilbur Konkel</article>

Never sang this hymn without my spirit confirming God is too good to be questioned. He knew from the beginning we were unworthy....yet made us righteous and gave us His word to ensure we had hope and later sent His word to become flesh just to guarantee we spend eternity in His presence.



Only the true God who made man could give all...Hossanah in the highest</article>
	<article author="Frank Pytel" email="" city="Chicago" provst="Illinois" country="United States" month="5" day="1" year="2010">Whenever I sing this hymn before the Lord, I realize He is so much, and I am so little. I cannot match Him, or compare! One day as I was singing this hymn verse two became real to me. He had given His years as man, that I can share in His eternity and glory. I decided to leave my job, and give Him one year to be in His Word and share His gospel. As the years go on I can increase in possessions, or in a bank account, but my time is not increasing. My time is being spent year by year, day by day, and hour by hour! How many years are left for me? I don't know. "My years for Thee be spent."</article>

Oh Lord, Thou hast suffered all the shame and pain. The question remains what have I done for You. Your commission we know Lord but need the strength to do. Praise You Lord You are our strength and ability. Fill us today Lord with Thyself and take the gospel to the ends of the world. Christ is the gospel and the gospel is Christ. Oh brothers and sisters we need to release Christ, minister Christ and preach Christ and preach Christ from our spirit to sinners.</article>
