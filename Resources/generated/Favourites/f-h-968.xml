    <article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="12" day="3" year="2013">In April, 1822 James Montgomery was speaking in Liverpool at a Methodist missionary meeting. It was a time when the English were waking up to foreign missions, and numerous meetings like this one were presenting worldwide needs and commissioning new workers. Montgomery himself was a Moravian and already a noted hymnwriter. He loved to promote missionary zeal whenever he could.
As the hymnwriter spoke, the lights suddenly went out in the building. Then there was a loud crash as the back of a seat was broken in the darkness. For a moment it seemed that mass panic might ensue. But then the chairman [Adam Clarke] of the meeting called out, "There is still light within," and Montgomery resumed speaking. The crowd calmed down, listening in the darkness. Montgomery concluded his words by reciting this newly written hymn, "Hail to the Lord's Anointed." - Great Songs of Faith by Brown and Norton
-------------
This hymn is based on Psalm 72. Adam Clark used this hymn in his famous commentary on that psalm.
--------------
There are additional stanzas. The 2nd &amp; 3rd stanzas are:
2. He comes in succor speedy 
to those who suffer wrong;
 To help the poor and needy, 
and bid the weak be strong;
 To give them songs for sighing,
 their darkness turn to light,
 Whose souls, condemned and dying, 
were precious in His sight.
------------------
3. By such shall He be fearèd 
while sun and moon endure;
 Beloved, obeyed, reverèd; 
for He shall judge the poor
 Through changing generations, 
with justice, mercy, truth,
 While stars maintain their stations, 
or moons renew their youth.
------------------------
The 5th stanza following hymnal.net stanza #2:
5. Arabia’s desert ranger 
to Him shall bow the knee;
 The Ethiopian stranger 
His glory come to see;
 With offerings of devotion 
ships from the isles shall meet,
 To pour the wealth of oceans 
in tribute at His feet.</article>
