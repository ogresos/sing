Never let me win;
Oh, defeat me all the time"

This is a great prayer, no wonder our brother Ed Marks reminds us again and again to pray this prayer.

It happen to Jacob, it is happening to us, in our dealings The Lord will do what it takes to touch our natural life...then after quite a long time, just as in Jacob, we will be subdued, no trace of the natural life, no trace of the "old man" but a transformed Israel, who wrestled with God.
Lord thank You for wrestling with us, You lowered down to wrestle with us, because of Your great love for man, and You don't let us go until our thigh is touched; all because of Your Economy. Amen, Lord.</article>
