Everything has a turning point, an end point, and nothing will last except the eternal life of God. 
Saints! Let us learn how to number our days, treasuring and spending more time with the Lord, not to the world.
Treasuring the Lord is our most valuable time on earth!</article>

Our years, our wealth, our possession, everything that we attained, all these things will surely come to an end. Lord, may You help us see Your Supreme Preciousness for us to be able to change our valuation. Yes Lord, we sometimes become blinded from the things that we have seen and to the things that we are attracted. Thank the Lord for this very refreshing hymn! Lord, may You teach us to number our days so that we may gain a heart of wisdom. Above all, You are very Precious from all the temporary things that we have seen. We love You Lord Jesus!</article>
