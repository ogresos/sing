	<article author="Milton E Anderson" email="ambassador.milton@gmail.com" city="Sanford" provst="Florida" country="United States" month="7" day="5" year="2016">I awoke this morning with the tune of this song in my heart. Since I'm more familiar with the words in Spanish, “Hallé un buen Amigo", I came here for the English language version. As I consider the words expressing such depth of the believer's experience and hope in Jesus, it amazes me to consider how such a beautiful song of praise and worship could ever be ignored, if not forgotten, by the church at large.</article>

Footnote on apple tree—The lover appreciates Christ as the source of rich provision (apple tree) who supplies her in a timely way.
