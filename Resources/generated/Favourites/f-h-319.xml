	<article author="Sherrilynn Tolliver" email="smtolliver@aol.com" city="Capitol Heights" provst="Maryland" country="United States" month="4" day="24" year="2016">I awoke early this morning with a few words from the title of this hymn and the melody playing in my spirit. I had only heard this hymn a few times in my life. I have been feeling detached from God. This hymn reminds me to remember the grace and mercy He shows me everyday and to SEEK Him. One of the most beautiful hymns I have heard.</article>

	<article author="Rober McEvers" email="sonrise1@outlook.com" city="Barneston" provst="NE" country="United States" month="1" day="7" year="2015">This beautiful "melodious sonnet" breaks my heart each time I hear it, for I, too, have had a heart prone to wander. I once read an account of the author who, years later, after he had, indeed, wandered far and long from God, was seated on a train near a young lady who was beautifully singing the words of his song. It broke his heart so, that he returned to the God he loved...the prodigal returned to the God who loved him.</article>

	<article author="Joan" email="" city="" provst="South Carolina" country="United States" month="9" day="20" year="2013">Another verse:
I was lost in utter darkness
Til You came and rescued me;
I was bound by all my sin when
Your love came and set me free. 
Now my soul can sing a new song,
Now my heart has found a home,
And Your grace is always with me
And I'll never be alone!

Chorus:
Come Thou Fount, come Thou King,
Come Thou precious Prince of Peace
Hear Your bride, to You we sing,
Come Thou Fount of our blessing.</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="9" day="19" year="2013">Robert Robinson had always been prone to wander. Apprenticed to a barber at 14, he spent more time reading and playing with friends than cutting hair. Then, still a teen, he went to a George Whitfield meeting, intending to ridicule it - and instead was converted. After his apprenticeship was over, Robinson went into the ministry. He wrote this hymn at the age of 23 as he served at the Calvinistic Methodist Church in Norfolk, England.
Late in life, Robinson did stray from the faith. Once, in a stagecoach, he sat by a lady who was reading a hymnbook. She showed him "Come, Thou Fount," saying how wonderful it was. He tried to change the subject, but couldn't. Finally he said, "Madam, I am the unhappy man who wrote that hymn many years ago, and I would give a thousand worlds to enjoy the feelings I had then." - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton

See David Jones' posting on 4/18/2010 for lyrics closer to the original. My favorite part of this hymn is the rich allusion of the memorable, "Here I raise my Ebenezer" (stone of help 1 Sam 7:2-14) in the original stanza 2.</article>
	<article author="Abigail" email="adaraloyea@yahoo.com" city="Lagos" provst="" country="Nigeria" month="5" day="28" year="2013">This song is an exact expression of my heart to God, most especially the third verse.</article>

	<article author="Rosita Enriquez" email="" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="4" day="3" year="2012">The Melody is beautiful, soul-catching. Perhaps The Lord may inspire some to write more songs with this Music. Some of their fresh enjoyment of The Lord or from a truth from a message.</article>

	<article author="EB" email="" city="" provst="" country="Barbados" month="9" day="19" year="2010">I first heard this song as part of a 3 CD set of '100 Best Love Hymns'. After playing the CD over and over, the song caught my attention and I was drawn to its melody and certain words I was able to make out. Wanting to find out more, I went on the net to research its lyrics and found your site. This song is truly beautiful. This was since last year. Yesterday (18 Sept 2010), I heard it in my spirit, click on the bookmark and listen to it again as the song minister to me once more and brought tears to my eyes.
Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today and tommorrow. Praise His holy name!
Let the redeemed of the Lord say so.</article>

	<article author="David Jones" email="" city="" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="4" day="18" year="2010">I love this song.

Come, Thou Fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace
Streams of mercy, never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise
Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above
Praise the mount, I'm fixed upon it
Mount of Thy unchanging love

Here I raise my Ebenezer
Here there by Thy great help I've come
And I hope, by Thy good pleasure
Safely to arrive at home
Jesus sought me when a stranger
Wandering from the fold of God
He, to rescue me from danger
Interposed His precious blood

O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be
Let that grace now, like a fetter
Bind my wandering heart to Thee
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love
Here's my heart, oh, take and seal it
Seal it for Thy courts above

Come, Thou Fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace
Streams of mercy, never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise
Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above
Praise the mount, I'm fixed upon it
Mount of Thy unchanging love</article>
