I was so touched and love the song right away. Thanks our dear Lord for the sweet love. 
And AMEN! we will stay there!</article>
	<article author="Rosita Enriquez" email="" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="1" day="30" year="2012">I enjoyed the following sentence from the attached excerpts. 
"Again I say, do not drop out of the dungeon. Stay there and stay there gloriously, with praises to the Lord..."

Hallelujah we will not drop out of our cage, we will stay here, raising up our praises to the Lord! The One who so wisely put us here! Hallelujah, Praise The Lord! I love my cage because I find my Beloved Jesus there!</article>
	<article author="ruby" email="" city="" provst="" country="India" month="10" day="4" year="2008">This song shows what kind of life Madam Guyon has lived on this earth. Though outwardly bound, she was free in her spirit. Her cage was not a barrier for her to enjoy the Lord. May the Lord cause us to enjoy Him in all our environments.</article>
	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="31" year="2008">Young people, no matter how long your trial may be, do not be disappointed. You need to recognize that your trial is of God. No one can be enthroned without being tried and tested. Although we like to be enthroned immediately, God would say, "The time is not yet. Do not talk to Me about enthronement. You need to be put into the dungeon." If you seek the Lord, the Lord will put you into a dungeon. Perhaps all who are around you—your wife, your children, the elders, and the brothers and sisters—intend to respect you; however, whatever they do only serves to put you into a dungeon. We have nothing to say about this. Without the dungeon, we cannot ascend to the throne. Do not be a dungeon dropout; stay in the dungeon until you graduate and receive the crown. You need the last two years.

Although I may have no intention of putting you in a dungeon and although you may have no intention of putting me in a dungeon, what actually happens is that we put one another into a dungeon. When you were married, did you intend to put your wife into a dungeon? Surely you had no such intention. But this is just what you have done. Unintentionally and unconsciously, we put others into a dungeon. My children have done this to me. Sometimes they tell me how much they love me, but within myself I say, "Your love puts me into a dungeon." Nevertheless, we need to say, "Hallelujah for the dungeon! Although I have been here for ten years, I need to stay another two years." Again I say, do not drop out of the dungeon. Stay there and stay there gloriously, with praises to the Lord, not with the gnashing of teeth.

Madame Guyon was one who could praise the Lord in her dungeon. She even wrote a poem in which she likened herself to a bird in a cage. Here is the first stanza:

A little bird I am,
Shut from the fields of air,
And in my cage I sit and sing
To Him who placed me there;
Well pleased a prisoner to be,
Because, my God, it pleaseth Thee.

Madame Guyon grew to love her cage, which was her dungeon.
