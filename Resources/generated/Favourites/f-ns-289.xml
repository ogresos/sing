We are called into His eternal glory by His glory, and virtue (energy of Life). His promise is that our sufferings for His sake are "just a little while. (stress is here)" All grace is ours! 
He is personally active (yet hidden) to perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground us in Himself, as our good land. What a perfecting! None else like this!</article>
