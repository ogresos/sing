    <article author="李 菲 麗" city="" provst="NC" country="United States" month="9" day="8" year="2011">Praise the Lord. This hymn matches what I appreciate and enjoy today in the Crystallization-study of the Psalms (1)--Message Four: The God-man Who Satisfies God's Desire and Fulfills His Good Pleasure [God would make known to Christ the path of life—resurrection (Psa. 16:11a; Matt. 28:6). In His incarnation Christ brought divinity into humanity; in His resurrection He brought humanity into divinity. In His incarnation Christ made something divine, human; in His resurrection He made something human, divine.] Praise the Lord!</article>
