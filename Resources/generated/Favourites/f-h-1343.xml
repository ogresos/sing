	<article author="steward" email="" city="Columbus" provst="North Dakota" country="United States" month="11" day="28" year="2008">The Lord Jesus Christ has loved us, and is loving us, and will love us, and this action of His takes place in the divine sphere; for it is His divine love that we partake of, which is the love He has given unto us to love one another. This is a new commandment that He has given unto us. Yet, we fail to keep His new commandment if we neglect to partake of the divine nature to receive His divine love, which divine love is the love which we love His brethren. And, those who witness this divine love which we partake of, will certainly know we are not just a mere organization, but a people of God, that is, His disciples, a set apart people from the world unto God. This sphere which we live in day by day, moment by moment is the Kingdom of God realized in us and expressed by us in this age. Let us not neglect this new commandment by neglecting the Lord Jesus Christ, but let the kingdom seed grow in us. Amen.</article>
