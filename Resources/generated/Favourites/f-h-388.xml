	<article author="Elaine Reid" email="temple.cott@tiscali.co.uk" city="Nottingham" provst="Nottinghamshire" country="United Kingdom" month="11" day="23" year="2015">This is a hymn that I remember hearing as a child many many years ago. I can't remember if we sang it as a family or my big sister sang it to me. 
I remember though that even as a small child there was something comforting about this hymn.
Today as a Christian it reminds me of God's bigness and my smallness; of my inadequacies and His all sufficient grace.
This hymn still brings me comfort.</article>

It meets you at the point of deepest needs when there is no one to turn to; when all the props are being dismantled or when the attacks of the enemy assail. It is reassuring soothing and comforting. Reassuring you that this is the pathway chosen for you and reminding you that other faithfuls are trudging the same pathway and that the Lord is neigh.</article>
