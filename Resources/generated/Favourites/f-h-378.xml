In the book of Matthew the word "mountain" is referred to about fourteen times. Each reference to the word "mountain" brings us into a new glimpse of Christ. Whether it be the first mention when He was tempted, or the last one where in resurrection He commissioned the disciples to "go," there is always a new revelation of Christ! May our life be one on that mountain where we can hear the Beloved's voice alone!</article>
