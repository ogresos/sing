	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="6" day="25" year="2014">This hymn is written by John G. Foote with E. A. H., who is probably Elisha A. Hoffman. Based on Exo 12:13
-------------------
The last 2 lines of each stanza are a bit different in the original:
1. Christ our Redeemer died on the cross,
 Died for the sinner, paid all his due;
 All who receive Him need never fear,
 Yes, He will pass, will pass over you. 
-----------
2 Chiefest of sinners, Jesus will save;
 As He has promised, so He will do;
 Oh, sinner, hear Him, trust in His Word,
 Then He will pass, will pass over you. 
------------
3 Judgment is coming, all will be there.
 Who have rejected, who have refused?
 Oh, sinner, hasten, let Jesus in,
 Oh, He will pass, will pass over you.
----------
4 O great compassion! O boundless love!
 Jesus hath power, Jesus is true;
 All who believe are safe from the storm,
 Oh, He will pass, will pass over you.</article>

i knew this hymn as a child living with my father when he used to play it on his turn-table stereo.
But today, I was in my office working when the song started ringing in my heart. hence I went online in search for it - with the lyrics of the first line, and found it, and I had to use my ear-piece connected to my computer to listen to this great hymn.
It's wonderful, heart-warming and soul-inspiring!
i thank God Almighty - who despite our sins and limitations, deemed it necessary to sacrifice His only begotten Son - Jesus Christ on the cross, for the atonememt of our sins. 
i pray that God Almighty - by His Holy Spirit will give all of us the grace to serve Him in spirit and in truth, in purity, holiness and righteousness, and help us to make heaven at last in the mighty name of Jesus Christ - Amen!</article>

Now, a few days before my 58th birthday, I wanted to sing this song for my meditation before prayer. Thank you for having the words to this song on your website. It gives me strength in my walk to remember that the Blood still covers me as I continue to make holiness a lifestyle in a wicked world. Christ Jesus, thank You for Your Blood!</article>

	<article author="Adenike Odunuga" email="" city="Abuja" provst="" country="Nigeria" month="3" day="8" year="2007">The song says all paymnets have been fully paid for my sin. Always reminds me of what happened in Egypt when the Israelites were delivered. Just today when I remembered a ill that might happen, I quickly remembered the angel of evil will pass over me because the blood covers me. The passover lamb Jesus has been slain for me. The song also makes me feel the responsibility of keepin away from sin while also assuring of atonement in case I fall into sin.</article>

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="9" day="15" year="2012">First Corinthians 5 tells us that Christ is our Passover (v. 7). He is the Passover lamb. When those in Christianity use the passover lamb for gospel preaching, they always stress the blood. We have a good hymn, the chorus of which says, "When I see the blood,...I will pass over you" (Hymns, #1005). But we need to see that with the passover lamb there is something in addition to the blood. That is the meat. The blood had to be shed, and the meat of the lamb had to be eaten. The striking of the blood was for the eating of the meat. They applied the blood to the house, and then in the house they ate. The striking of the blood was not the goal; the eating of the meat was. Christ is the real Passover lamb, and He has been sacrificed for us, not only to redeem us but also to satisfy us. His blood redeemed us, and His life satisfies us.
