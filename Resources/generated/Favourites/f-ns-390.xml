C." country="Canada" month="7" day="13" year="2016">Let us open to the Lord Himself through prayer, breathe Him deeply as the air. (O Lord Jesus!) Gain the life supply (as the oil of exalting joy) by praying to Him, until our being's filled up to the brim. Make us those who're one with You in prayer, echo the things for which You care. Lord, do make us one so that Your heart's desire we share; in this age, gain Your men of prayer. ... Thank You Lord Jesus! Praise You O Lord! Amen.</article>

May these words become our daily reality. Cause us to realize that when the church prays, tracks are laid for God's move throughout the earth. O Lord how you need us to pray to build up the Body of Christ, to end this age and to bring in the kingdom! Amen.</article>
