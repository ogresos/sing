It simply encourages us brothers and sisters to go on, continue pursuing the Lord Jesus. Aspiring us to become the mighty ones of the Lord!
Four words:
Oh Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</article>

I love the Lord, and I thank that to the Lord's recovery, the local churches. It is lovely to live in His Body.</article>
