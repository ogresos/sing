We now have God as our portion because Christ has died for us. Through the shedding of His blood, God becomes our all in all. His blood ushers us to God Himself.
"O Lord, thank You for this cup of blessing. Lord, we just want to drink this cup in love in remembrance of You. Lord, You are our all in all."
Praise the Lord!</article>

I did not deserve to enjoy the heavenly taste neverthereless our LORD said to me " come, eat my flesh and drink my blood". As the members of HIS Body, in love, we drink this come in remembrance of our LORD.</article>
	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="31" year="2008">[Psalms 16] Verse 5 says, "Jehovah is the portion of My inheritance and of My cup;/You maintain My lot." God is the portion of two things: of the inheritance and of the cup. The inheritance refers to the substance of the lot, and the cup refers to the enjoyment of God as our blessing. At the Lord's table, we drink the cup of blessing (1 Cor. 10:16a). Stanza 3 of Hymns, #223 points out that in this cup God is our portion. Thus, we have God as the portion for our inheritance and for our enjoyment. God the Father was the very portion of these two things to Christ as a man on this earth. Verse 5b says, "You maintain My lot." The lot is the portion of the inheritance.
