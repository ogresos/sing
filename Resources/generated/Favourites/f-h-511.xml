	<article author="Bernard Brechum" email="breck_h50@yahoo.com" city="Winneba" provst="Central" country="Ghana" month="6" day="3" year="2015">Jesus only is our message. We have nothing else to preach.
"But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.
As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed."
(Gal. 1:8-9)
Lord, Please make us faithful to this call.</article>

	<article author="Tosin 'Badeniyi" email="" city="Durban" provst="Kwazulu Natal" country="South Africa" month="2" day="7" year="2012">I like the hymn. We used to sing quite often at Deeper Life Church Nigeria. It is like an anthem there. Jesus is our everything. We must always look unto Him. He is the Author and Finisher of our faith. It is very possible to shift focus from Him and turn to methods, men etc. But we must never forget that He died and paid the full price for whatever we may need. We love You Jesus, our Saviour, Our Sanctifier, Our Healer and Coming King.</article>

	<article author="Bolaji" email="" city="Croydon" provst="Surrey" country="United Kingdom" month="2" day="26" year="2010">This song reminds me of my early years as a Christian when I was first taught it. Yet it it still relevant to every message we preach be it a posperity, holiness, or salvation. I was reminded of this song today by this Scripture that keeps cominig to my heart. John 12:20-23. V21 in particular says 'Sir, we would like to see Jesus'
I pray that all those trying to find Jesus today will see Him. And one day we shall all see Him in person. Sis Nike I read your comment. Just to encourage you, keep on preaching Jesus. Where His presence is absence, the Bible say we should not be. Thank God the celebrant invited Jesus to his wedding when wine ran out. And as wine will run out one day in every marriage, every married couple better make sure that Jesus is invited.</article>

	<article author="Adenike Odunuga" email="" city="Lagos" provst="" country="Nigeria" month="1" day="21" year="2007">This song reminds me that Jesus should be central to my life. Once a course mate accused me of being 'too Christian'. She was angry that I brought Jesus into everything. Not deliberate but naturally, when we live the life that we should now live in Christ who loved us so much and died for us, we can't but have him as the theme of everything, He will have to be our only message.</article>
