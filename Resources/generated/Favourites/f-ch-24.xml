神的大愛真是遠超筆所能描、口所能陳；
牠比最高星宿還高，牠比最深地獄還深。
始祖犯罪，驚恐自危，神賜愛子來救；
當人痛悔，神就迎歸，所有罪案全勾。
The love of God is greater far
Than tongue or pen can ever tell;
It goes beyond the highest star,
And reaches to the lowest hell;
The guilty pair, bowed down with care,
God gave His Son to win;
His erring child He reconciled,
And pardoned from his sin.


副）
哦，神的愛，何其豐富、何其無法測量！
牠是堅強，存到永古，天使、聖徒同唱。
Refrain
O love of God, how rich and pure!
How measureless and strong!
It shall forevermore endure
The saints’ and angels’ song.

二
歲月消逝，榮華衰敗，天地廢去，事物更變，
人今拒絕神的大愛，那日惟有求助山岩；
神的大愛不會稍改，何其無法測量；
大施恩貸，對人罪債，聖徒、天使同唱。
When years of time shall pass away,
And earthly thrones and kingdoms fall,
When men, who here refuse to pray,
On rocks and hills and mountains call,
God’s love so sure, shall still endure,
All measureless and strong;
Redeeming grace to Adam’s race—
The saints’ and angels’ song.

三
縱令洋海儘是墨汁，無邊穹蒼都成白紙，
田間草杆根根筆枝，世上眾人個個文士；
若寫神的大愛無極，一切猶感缺欠；
墨幹、筆棄、紙罄、人敝，
未能寫出半點。
Could we with ink the ocean fill,
And were the skies of parchment made,
Were every stalk on earth a quill,
And every man a scribe by trade,
To write the love of God above,
Would drain the ocean dry.
Nor could the scroll contain the whole,
Though stretched from sky to sky.</article>
