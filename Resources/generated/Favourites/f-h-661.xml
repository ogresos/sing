    <article author="Sam" city="West central Illinois" country="U.S.A." month="2" day="28" year="2007">At the time of the birth (1953) of my sister Susan, the second verse of this hymn brought peace to my mother.

At Susans death (1958) the fifth verse was an inspiration for her as well as the entire family.

Thanks for sharing!</article>
