	<article author="Robin" email="" city="" provst="" country="Singapore" month="8" day="19" year="2016">During cell tonight, we were discussing what it means to be in"such a time this"... a night where we refocus our commitment to be single-minded in loving God and loving people, so that we can be part of God’s end-time harvest force and this song came to us... we sang and were moved.</article>
	<article author="Sound Emperor" email="jim@mountaintopmedia.org" city="Coarsegold" provst="CA" country="United States" month="7" day="4" year="2016">My mother sang this song while lying in her bed, every night, just before going to sleep. It has been an inspiration to me ever since. Most "Christians" today don't seem to think they need to change anything in their lives.  This song is pure "Paul". Paul lived for Jesus, everyday. 
In response to E.C.'s "explanation" of the lyrics change, I simply say this. Christ's death on the cross is our atonement. In case you haven't figured this out yet, the entire old testament--and especially the sacrificial system--pointed to Jesus, and His sacrifice. 
We are not, I am not, a "New Testament" Christian, but rather a Biblical Christian, as the entire Bible is written as our guidebook. The old testament is full of vital information for the Christian life. 
I believe this song is inspired by God. You can sing however you wish E.C, but don't change the lyrics when you publish them. The song stands on its own.</article>

What a challenge is presented to believers in this song! I'm very moved by it. I trust that I will be able to fulfill the truths presented in it, not only today, but every day.</article>
	<article author="Michael" email="michaelcottam3@gmail.com" city="Lompoc" provst="CA" country="United States" month="8" day="30" year="2014">This song was put on my heart last week and then we sang it Sunday @ services. It has been on my mind since then. This morning I am getting together a lesson for a devotional this Sun evening. I am in 1 Cor 9:24-27 where Paul makes use of the Greek games to illustrate the spiritual race of the believer. Just as an athlete must deny himself many gratifications of the body, As Christians, we too must deny ourselves many gratifications of the flesh, This song Alive and in my heart helps me to do exactly that! Glory to God!</article>

	<article author="Brian" email="roannbeetleshow@yahoo.com" city="Roann" provst="Indiana" country="United States" month="6" day="22" year="2014">I appreciate the explanation of the lyrics change, but it still doesn't sit right with me. I'm leery of changing the lyricist's words because something is "better." For example, non-Trinitarian groups change "Holy, Holy, Holy" to end with a phrase something like: "God in His glory, blessed Deity" (instead of God in three Persons, blessed Trinity."
I'd rather have an explanation as to why the original lyrics are as they are rather than have an arbitrary change.</article>

	<article author="E.C." email="edwrdchang@gmail.com" city="San Diego" provst="CA" country="" month="5" day="22" year="2014">I would like to just give a thorough comment to all those who are wondering and questioning further on why the compilers here have stated that they prefer the usage of the word "redemption" as opposed to "atonement". 
Firstly, please understand that the compilers' are our brothers and sisters in spirit, and that nothing is done without careful consideration and prayer. That said, we should not be under the sweeping judgement that they did so carelessly. The fact that they left a note stating the original word shows their care not to offend anybody aware of the original lyrics, such as myself. Let us bear one another in love, and I believe a brief consideration of the truth in the scripture will clear up any confusion and also benefit us all to why this distinction between these two words is so important to us as New Testament believers.
The word "atonement", as others have mentioned, is based on the Hebrew word kaphar (Strong's Number 3722), meaning to "cover over" such as a lid as the lid of the ark of the covenant. It's primary usage in the Old Testament was mainly in regards to the sacrifices. God's commandment to the Children of Israel throughout the book of Exodus was to make a sin offering for atonement, for the sake of covering their offenses and sins and that the sacrifice of atonement was made holy and not to be touched for it was now presented to the Lord, to be given to the Lord to satisfy His demands of righteousness, holiness, and glory. Later, this is used in regards to the burnt and peace offerings throughout Leviticus. In a sense, the Children of Israel could not do so because of their transgressions, and therefore the atonement became the factor by which before God, they could be forgiven, cleansed, and come before God at the altar to present and consecrate themselves to God (c.f. Exodus 29:33, 32:30; Leviticus 16:16-18, 30, 19:22). This is the principle of a covering by sacrifice.
Yet while this picture is important for us to see and even compare with Christ as what He has done for us, we must realize that what Christ has done is much more than symbolized through the word atonement. Atonement, while making us right with God, means only this much—in the Old Testament age, we are still lost in sin, captives of sin in our flesh, and must constantly seek covering in the sacrifices (which I have no part in because I am a Gentile, not the Jews of God's called elect to live according to the law, the ordinances, and the sacrifices). 
But Redemption, a buying back and freeing, which includes the principle atonement, includes more: the results of God's complete salvation—we are not only freed from the burden of our sins, but from the consequences of sin. That is, we have in Christ, His very life divine in us which frees us from being captives of sin living in our sins but now are captives of Christ, belonging to Him and claiming Him as our true atonement to cover our sins but even more that—Christ's life in us in the spirit is dealing with the sinful nature we bear. We, as New Testament believers, are not merely living a life of the sacrifices seeking to please God according to the law and ordinances as a religious practice as the Old Testament followers did, but are living out His life in us (Galatians 2:20-21) which is working in us as we are now His many sons in Christ to be joint heirs with Christ in the coming kingdom and eternity (Romans 8:17). We have been born anew, no longer of the old creation, belonging to a world in the Old Testament, but living as a new creation (Galatians 6:15). Christ on the cross terminated the old and has made us, the Church, His new creation (Ephesians 2:10). We are a new creation! This is our glorious inheritance. This is why we do not sing merely atonement, but of a marvelous redemption that Christ has accomplished. 
Christ has done much more than a being just a propitiation for our sins as John does speak of (and yes, He has done that), but much more, we are being saved in His life and being brought from glory to glory. He has dealt with the sinful nature in our being, freeing us, giving us His life divine, and making us His many sons who are His new creation. Praise Him that He has done so much for us and done it all, and that without Him, we would not be here today as His New Testament believers. There is no way for us to sing this genuinely if we try to hard as we do to live a life by merely being good people following the law and giving alms, etc. Buddhists can do this, atheists can do this, and so many others who are not Christians can live as good people who "do not sin", but the fact is that they do not have the secret, which is what we Christians profess: Christ, who has done it all, has freed us from the nature of sin in our flesh and now lives in us as our master, our life, and our everything so that we may echo the words of Paul - "not I, but Christ" (Galatians 2:20). May the Lord bring us on, day by day, to live out His very life so that we may truly, genuinely echo the words of this hymn:
I own no other Master,
My heart shall be Thy throne,
My life I give, henceforth to live,
O Christ, for Thee alone.</article>

	<article author="Myrra" email="" city="" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="8" day="24" year="2013">Really appreciate the compilers' efforts in changing "atonement" to "redemption" since the former is scripturally incorrect. Atonement in its original Hebrew form (kaphar) means to cover, which was what the levitical offerings, like the sin offerings, did. The blood of those animals sacrifices merely covered sins, but the blood of Jesus Christ washes away sins completely.</article>

	<article author="B Liu" email="" city="Toronto" provst="Ontario" country="Canada" month="10" day="12" year="2009">Christ was crucified on the cross to die an all-inclusive death for His divine dispensing.
- as the Lamb of God, He took away our sin.
- as the bronze serpent, He destroyed Satan.
- as the grain of wheat, He released the divine life for the producing of many believers.

God's heart desire is to dispense Himself with all His riches into His chosen and redeemed people for His corporate expression.

In the New Testament economy of God there is the desperate need of the stewardship of God. Every member of the Body of Christ has the priviledge. We need to fulfill our stewardship, being filled with Christ and dispensing the unsearchable riches of Christ into both believers and unbelievers.

We need to answer His call, follow His leading and give Him our all.</article>

LIVING FOR JESUS

-1-
Living for Jesus, a life that is true,
Striving to please Him in all that I do;
Yielding allegiance, glad hearted and free,
This is the pathway of blessing for me.

Refrain
O Jesus, Lord and Savior, I give myself to Thee,
For Thou, in Thy atonement, didst give Thyself for me.
I own no other Master, my heart shall be Thy throne.
My life I give, henceforth to live, O Christ, for Thee alone.

-2-
Living for Jesus Who died in my place,
Bearing on Calvary my sin and disgrace;
Such love constrains me to answer His call,
Follow His leading and give Him my all.

-3-
Living for Jesus, wherever I am,
Doing each duty in His holy Name;
Willing to suffer affliction and loss,
Deeming each trial a part of my cross.

-4-
Living for Jesus through earth’s little while,
My dearest treasure, the light of His smile;
Seeking the lost ones He died to redeem,
Bringing the weary to find rest in Him.</article>
