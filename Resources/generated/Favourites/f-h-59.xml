At the age of 13 he left school and entered his father's book-selling business but continued to educate himself. He became a good writer and wrote articles for magazines, produced a volume of poems, edited a Nonconformist newspaper, and also acted as a lay preacher. In 1836 he edited the "Congregational Hymn Book: a Supplement to Dr. Watts' Hymns and Psalms". In this collection he added 56 of his own hymns. At the time of his death he had prepared for the press a collection of all his hymns. His son published it and entitled it, "Hymns of Praise and Prayer and Devout Meditation." In the preface, his son wrote that many of his father's hymns are "transcripts of personal experience and add to the proofs so often given that God tunes the heart by trial and sorrow, not only to patience but to praise." - Songs of the Spirit by Martin

In the original, the last 2 lines of each stanza say:
Worthy, O Lamb of God, art Thou
that every knee to Thee should bow.</article>

"Divine, O Son of God, art Thou, In Thee God's fulness find we now."

The Lord Jesus is fully divine - fully God. When we touch Christ, we get God's fulness!</article>
