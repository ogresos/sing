To his Sunday school teacher he ascribes the honor of prompting him to poetic efforts: and the same teacher did much to shape his early life. His first printed hymn, "Hark! in the presence of our God," was written in September, 1842, at Carisbrooke Castle, and printed in the Youthâ€™s Magazine in November of the same year. Since then he has written over 300, many of them for children. He was with the Plymouth Brethren - Dictionary of Hymnology by Julian

The 4th stanza above is not part of the original, but I think it is an improvement. The original 4th and 5th stanzas are:
4 Himself He could not save,
Love's stream too deeply flowed,
In love Himself He gave,
To pay the debt we owed.
Obedience to His Father's will,
And love to Him did all fulfil.

5 And now exalted high: --- 
A Prince and Saviour He,
That sinners might draw nigh
And drink of mercy free,
Of mercy now so richly shed,
For Jesus liveth who was dead.</article>

If I may make a suggestion I would change "Himself He could not save" into "Himself He wouldn't save" for the following reasons:
John 10:30 says:"I and (my) Father are one." ; and John 3:16 says:"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life," 
From these two verses we know that not "Himself He could not save" but "Himself He wouldn't save". So in many Christians believe that crucifixion was actually pre-ordained beforehand, as part of a divine plan in which Jesus had to suffer and die as sacrifice to pay for everyone's sins.</article>
