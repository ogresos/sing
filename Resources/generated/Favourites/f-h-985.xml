    <article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="3" day="16" year="2014">Born in Oxford, England, in 1827, Mrs. Bevan was the daughter of P. N. Shuttleworth, the Bishop of Chichester. She married the Evangelical Anglican, R. C. L. Bevan, in 1856 and had 9 children. Soon afterwards she became associated with the Open Brethren. After her husband's death she lived in southern France until her death at the age of 82. After 1858 she published several collections of hymns, mainly paraphrases from the German language. Although she wrote anonymously, she is best known for her translation of "Sinners, Jesus will receive", written by E. Neumeister. She also wrote 2 biographies, "The Story of John Wesley" and "The Life of William Farel", both published by Bible Truth Publishers. ...
Very few hymn writers render such a proper understanding of life in eternity. ... God in Christ shining in glory, and the believers also, no longer as earthen vessels, but as Christ's new creation, the Bride, will be shining with the glory of God. - Songs of the Spirit by Martin</article>
