But I know deep down inside my heart, the Lord is a living Lord. He knows what is He after. Despite of all things, his love will continuously constraining us and His mercy and grace will be us.

Lord, by Your grace and mercy, oh, fill me with Your self more. Lord cause me to be willing to let You come in and do Your working within me. Apart from You Lord I can do nothing. I can't trust myself that's why I need You most. May Your desire be also my desire Lord.</article>

	<article author="Igor Savinkin" email="igor.savinkin@gmail.com" city="Riga" provst="" country="Latvia" month="10" day="17" year="2014">I realize how important for me to be taken away from my self and be filled with this precious Person. In a sense I'm tired of my self-protection, cause of lack of openness and trust to Him. "Lord, You produce in me both willing and working to open to You, not to protect my poor self". How sweet, stable and secure is to be one with Him. It's there where we take part in living out and working out of His desire. 
"Take me Lord", "fill me with Your dear Self"</article>

	<article author="Ernjay" email="ernjaykim92@gmail.com" city="Iligan City" provst="" country="Philippines" month="2" day="21" year="2013">Oh! How we need to be fully open to the Lord every moment (that means at all times) until we are fully one with Him and one with His dream and His desire. He wanted us not only to know His dream and His desire but much more to live His dream, that is, to experience His infilling and His making His home in our hearts by giving our all to Him and opening our entire being to Him until we become His built-up Body, His Bride, His army, the Stone, the Kingdom (the Mountain filling the whole earth) -- ultimately, the New Jerusalem! Praise the Lord!</article>

I am very open to You. I need You to always empower me and strengthen my inner man. Without, I am nothing. There are times I am short of You. Thus, I desire You to fill me with Your dear Self. Amen!</article>
