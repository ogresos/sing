	<article author="Don Popienko" email="donjohnron@gmail.com" city="Salmon Arm" provst="BC" country="Canada" month="7" day="24" year="2014">The Song of Songs is not only a beautiful song, it is an encouragement for us to prepare our hearts as the bride of Christ, to have our lamps trimmed, and our vessels filled with the oil. O Father, may I be ready, I do not wish to be a carcass in the wilderness thru unbelief. By the conclusion of this great song, the Shullamite has breasts as towers, as a Philly she has become two strong armies. Maturity. I know mixed metaphors but seekers will know what I am saying. Love to all.</article>

	<article author="APC" email="" city="" provst="" country="Canada" month="9" day="10" year="2011">This hymn causes me to appreciate the Lord's love toward us as revealed in the Song of Songs. I am touched by the line, "O come Beloved, on my garden blow." As Christ's redeemed ones, we are being produced as an enclosed garden. This garden is something private, signifying our hidden and personal enjoyment and experiences of the Lord that is for Him alone. If we have such a relationship with the Lord, we will grow 'beds of spices' in the garden in our spirit, which is sweet and satisfying to His taste. Lord, thank You for Your love toward us. We desire to mature in life to be produced as Your Bride for Your satisfaction.</article>

Amen.There is nothing in the universe that can ever be compared to our enjoyment of the Triune God in the depth of our being. Oh Lord Jesus keep us in this reality to enjoy You in our being all our days to consummate Your eternal heart's desire; The New Jerusalem, God's eternal abode with man. Oh our dear Lord Jesus we treasure You as the One worthy to indwell us in the center, Lord, of our being, our human spirit. Oh Lord Jesus how we love You. Amen.</article>

I first sang this song in the Southeast College Conference of October 2002 in Simpsonville, South Carolina. I thoroughly enjoyed that time. This song is a constant reminder of that enjoyment of the Lord, and the wonderful fellowship with the saints. Furthermore, this song reminds me that I and the rest if the saints need intimate time with the Lord as often as possible. After all, this is how He feels toward us. Amen.</article>

The more I sing this song the happier the Lord Jesus is within me. He loves to hear us all tell Him we love Him. My eyes turn into dove's eyes. His Spirit is within me and outside of me. He is the BEST—-a Lamb sooooo precious and dear.</article>
