---------------
1 Work, for the night is coming,
 Work through the morning hours;
 Work while the dew is sparkling,
 Work ’mid springing flowers;
 Work when the day grows brighter,
 Work in the glowing sun;
 Work, for the night is coming,
 When man’s work is done.
------------------------------
2 Work, for the night is coming,
 Work through the sunny noon;
 Fill brightest hours with labor,
 Rest comes sure and soon.
 Give every flying minute,
 Something to keep in store;
 Work, for the night is coming,
 When man works no more.
--------------------
3 Work, for the night is coming,
 Under the sunset skies;
 While their bright tints are glowing,
 Work, for daylight flies.
 Work till the last beam fadeth,
 Fadeth to shine no more;
 Work, while the night is darkening,
 When man’s work is o’er.</article>

She wrote this hymn while she was in Canada in 1854. It was first published in a Canadian newspaper. They lived first at Pointe-Levy and then moved to Sarnia, where her father continued to work for the Grand Trunk Railway. Around that time, Annie and 2 sisters, Isabella and Frances, ran a girls' school. She returned to England in 1863 and in 1883 married Henry Coghill. - Songs of the Spirit by Martin and cyberhymnal</article>
