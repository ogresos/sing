Sometimes I need to be reminded to stop being so complicated, to just be simple and sing a song such as this to touch my spirit and in doing so isn't wonderful that I/we can actually touch God?! We can enjoy, partake of, have fellowship with the Triune God who is so big, strong, and mighty; yet He became the life-giving Spirit in order to be small enough to enter into our human spirit! Amazing if you ask me!!!</article>
