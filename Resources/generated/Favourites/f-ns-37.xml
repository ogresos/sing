            I've got a river of life flowing within me
                 ...................................
            Spring up O well! within my spirit
            Rise up and tell, so all can hear
            Spring up, O well, so I experience
            That life abundantly!

This happy song stirs up the young people's spirit, overflows from within them
and gushes into the gospel friends! Who can reject the overflowing of the river?
Amen! God can reach all people by this hymn! Give glory to Him!</article>

	<article author="Rosita Enriquez" email="rositalj@gmail.com" city="Anaheim" provst="CA" country="United States" month="8" day="26" year="2013">The Recovery Version has a wonderful footnote on the well that the Israelites had to dig in order to enjoy the gushing water. This well is the Christ that is already inside of us, in our heart. So, we must dig away all the dirt, the barriers in our heart-mind, emotion, will, and conscience-so that the Spirit, the living water, may spring up and flow freely! Numbers 21:17-18
Spring up, O well!!!</article>
