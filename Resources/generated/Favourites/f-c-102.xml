	<article author="Eric Matsumoto" email="" city="Elk Grove" provst="CA" country="United States" month="10" day="5" year="2008">My kids love this song, and I have come to appreciate it much more recently as we have begun to sing it in the car from the Hymns Jr CD! In a simple way, it shows us something quite deep about who Jesus Christ is--God mingled with man (Hand fully in and one with the glove), and who we are--man mingled with God (Hand gradually getting into the glove and the two becoming one)! Thank Him for the spiritual songs like this one at Hymnal.net that can be enjoyed at different levels.</article>

Amen! I am created to contain God. Praise God!!!</article>
