Thank You for looking at me with a compassionate and merciful eye because of the blood of Jesus Christ.
When I look at my life, if You had decided to end it and to destroy me You would have one thousand times reason. But it pleased You instead of punishing me for my faults, bringing down the punishments which deserve my sins on Jesus. 
I am not so skilled to understand that but I believe only in Your promises and I hope in You. You will surely lead me under cover. Thank You Lord.</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="10" day="9" year="2013">Though she was born into a well-to-do English family, Dora Greenwell's father died when she was young, and the family estate had to be sold. She struggled with fragile health as she lived alone in London. Why hadn't God given her an easier life? She worked with handicapped and mentally retarded children. Why did they have to suffer so?
When she was 39, Greenwell wrote her first book, The Patience of Hope. She was beginning to see how important patience is for dealing with life's hard questions. But she didn't want to dwell on the unanswered questions; she preferred to think about God's glorious exclamations. So when she compiled her book, Songs of Salvation, she included this poem, "I Am Not Skilled to Understand." - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>

The old tune lets these beautiful words shine. A dear friend of mine has cancer and the Lord reminded me of the first verse of this hymn, which I hadn't heard or sung for decades but how good God is to speak to my heart through this song and comfort me. To God be the Glory!</article>

It is called: My Savior My God. :)  Wonderful words put to a new rhythm &amp; tune and yet it is still the same wonderful news of our Almighty God.</article>

	<article author="Miss. Franklin Varghese" email="" city="Mumbai" provst="Maharashtra" country="India" month="5" day="6" year="2009">This song just speaks the 'HEART OUT' and is a 'FAITH BOOSTER'... It is really meaningful and touching... It just reminds us of God's loving-grace and mercy that was poured on the cross and that there is a future hope for us in Him...Indeed "My God He was, My God He is and My God He's always gonna be..." God Bless you...</article>
