	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="8" day="11" year="2013">Mary Lathbury is regarded as one of the founders of the Chautauqua movement, which began as a Christian summer conference on Lake Chautauqua in western NY. The movement spread across the country, providing both Christian education and cultural development to thousands of believers.
At Chautauqua in 1877, Lathbury was asked to write an appropriate evening hymn for the conference. As she sat watching the sun disappear behind the trees, she was inspired to write the 1st 2 stanzas of this hymn. The 3rd and 4th [see 8/12/12 posting by Bro Lawrence] were written 2 years later. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>
