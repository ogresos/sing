Psalm 23:1-6, contains 5 stages wherein we can experience Him in a deeper and higher enjoyment of the resurrected Christ. 
The resurrected Christ shepherds us, bring us all in green pasture and waters of rest. He restore our souls by reviving and transforming us on the path of righteousness. He leads us to experience the presence of the resurrected pneumatic Christ through the valley of the shadow of death. We do not fear those works of the evil one because it is only a shadow, and will remain a shadow. But through experiencing this valley of shadow of death, He leads us to a deeper and higher enjoyment of the resurrected Christ by fully feasting on Him on the table that He set and spread. O what a lifelong enjoyment of the divine goodness and kindness in the house of Jehovah.</article>
