For eternity, God dwells in man, the tabernacle of God, and man dwells in God, the Temple. Brother Lee once charged us to preach such a gospel. Man, frail, transient is God's dwelling for eternity, God, solid and immovable, is man's dwelling for eternity. Pretty wonderful, no? They really are not interchangeable. Thinking of them so takes away the wonderful mystery of God chosing to dwell in frail, mortal man and His gracing man with Himself as man's eternal abode. Wonderful!</article>

The final issue, The New Jerusalem, God and man mingled together!</article>
