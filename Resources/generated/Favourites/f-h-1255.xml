Babylon the Great has fallen, Satan has been cast down, and the local church is builded on the local ground"

I can testify that in the time when I have not exercised heart to love the Lord and my spirit to contact Him, my vision has become dim and my eyes veiled. But praise the Lord, that when our heart is turned to the Lord, the veil is taken away!
It is the Lord's mercy to have our hearts turned to Him and our eyes opened to see the Lord's recovery.
May the Lord bring us to keep our heart loving Him and our spirit burning!
Lord, keep us in Your recovery!</article>

    <article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="28" year="2008">Since the holy writings have been translated and interpreted, we need the understanding of the holy writings. Hence, the learning of the divine truths by studying the translated and interpreted holy writings is necessary (2 Tim. 3:15). We need to pray, "Lord, open my ears so I can hear, and open my eyes so I can see." Paul prayed in Ephesians 1 that the Lord would grant us a spirit of wisdom and revelation (v. 17). A line in Hymns, #1255 says, "When we exercise our spirit, / Our vision is so clear." In order to have the proper" understanding of the translated and interpreted holy writings, we need to exercise our spirit. We need to contact God, praying to Him and humbling ourselves by saying, "Lord, I know nothing. I need You." I can testify that when I come to the Word in this way, the light is there and I understand it.
