I do remember some 65 years ago, as a young boy sitting alone in calm pleasant surroundings, listening and looking up on a high whilte blank wall, gazing a long time upon a lone large beautiful picture of a man called Jesus. 
I felt in my body that He put His love on m . He said I will came and live with you. "Do not be discouraged, I am God over all, I will help you." 
Though the years the message and comfort this tune has give me has been an anchor and the promise that Jesus Christ lives. That He keeps His promises. He says, "I tell you the truth."</article>

I receive grace, not to forget.</article>

---------------------
"The great singer of psalms in the Bible was David. And his advice was to 'sing praises unto the Lord.' It's good advice, too - especially when we've got so much to be thankful for, so much to sing about. 'Count your blessings, name them one by one.' We know the Source of all these blessings we receive; we know where they come from. So in this wonderful happy hymn we count these blessings, and give thanks." - Tennessee Ernie Ford (1919-91)</article>

	<article author="Tonyson Richlake" email="katere.tonyson@gmail.com" city="Port Harcourt" provst="River States" country="Nigeria" month="5" day="16" year="2015">This appears to be my favorite hymn. If I can put in one word what God has done and still is doing in my life, it will be "awesome". Nothing is worth to pay for his kind gestures. But to say thank you. Because if we try to pay Him for everything, we will stay indebted to Him forever. Though we are indebted to God forever!</article>

They are your trophies when you feel discouraged, tempted , depressed or burdened. I was pleasantly surprised today, to see what I had written down a year ago. They were many!!! The truth is that I had either forgotten many of those things OR I had taken them for granted. PLEASE ALWAYS DOCUMENT THEM. Like David presented his trophies to Saul (1 Sam. 17:34-37). They are your trophies!!!!</article>

	<article author="Edward" email="hyim104@students.bju.edu" city="Statesboro" provst="GA" country="United States" month="2" day="23" year="2013">I was really encouraged by this beautiful hymn. If I sum up my whole life,
my life was full of bunch of complaints even after I was saved.

I kept complaining that I was born and am from Korea. I kept envying White Europeans or Americas, but the Lord answered me that He will use this Asian to be a part of Americans to show forth His glory. (I still gotta learn more about that, but my complaint about that decreased through the grace, love, and blessing of God.)

For my parents prepared to immigrate to the United States from 9 years ago, and we came here in June last year and got permanent residence 3 weeks after we came here. 

I also complained that I am not good at anything, but the Lord gave me some talents at remembering dates, people, people's last name, what day a day is, finding a destination to help my dad who drives my family's car, a lot of interest in map, etc.

I am a nursing major, but recently, I am constantly and humbly praying to the Lord to guide me to go to another university to study about geography especially  maps. 

Lord, thank you for giving me a lot of blessings. Whenever I am depressed about my weakness or envy other people's appearance or talents, I will always count all my blessings that You have provided.</article>

We tend to focus on what we don't have or wish we had, instead of what we already have. I like this hymn because it draws our attention to all the things we ought to be thankful for (many of them money cannot buy) - and indeed they are numerous.</article>
	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="25" year="2008">In the Old Testament the basic thought with respect to blessing is that of bringing people into God's presence. But in the New Testament the Apostle, coming with God, not only brought people into the presence of God; he also brought God into them. There is a great difference between the Old Testament pattern of blessing by the priests and the New Testament pattern of blessing by the Apostle. The New Testament blessing is much higher and deeper. On the one hand, to bless others is to bring them into the presence of God; on the other hand, it is to bring God into them as love, grace, and fellowship.

All Christians are familiar with the word blessing. One hymn even says, "Count your blessings, name them one by one." Undoubtedly, the concept of blessing expressed in this hymn is that blessing is a matter of being given a good wife, children, education, promotions, houses, and cars. According to this hymn, these are the blessings we should count one by one. More than thirty-five years ago, I sang this hymn during the last few hours of the year. I would gather some together and say, "Let us count the blessings of this past year, one by one." But the blessing according to the pure Word is much different from this. According to the Old Testament pattern of the blessing by the priest and the New Testament pattern of blessing by the Apostle, the proper blessing is to bring people into the presence of God and to bring God into them as grace, love, and fellowship that they may enjoy the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Hence, blessing is a matter of enjoying the Triune God.
