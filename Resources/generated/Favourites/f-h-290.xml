Charles H. Gabriel was born in the state of Iowa, in a shack made of crude boards plastered inside and out. There was not a tree nor a shrub to shelter the house from the howling winds and raging snow storms. He never saw a musical instrument until he was nine years old, and he never had a music lesson in his life. Mr. Gabriel was converted in his teens and began to teach music to black boys, although he had never had a lesson himself. - 'More Living Hymn Stories' by Wilbur Konkel</article>

	<article author="Andy" email="" city="Salem" provst="OH" country="United States" month="4" day="8" year="2015">Preston, I think you nailed it, that this is just a poetic way of saying that Jesus loves us more than He loves Himself. In the garden of Gethsemane, for example, Jesus was full of sorrow and grief.</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="4" day="8" year="2013">In the early 1900's Charles H. Gabriel was the king of gospel music. Gabriel wrote the words and music for a number of hymns used by popular evangelists of his day such as Billy Sunday and his song-leader, Homer Rodeheaver.
Gabriel's hymns reflect a change in the style of gospel music. In the 1800's, hymns were deeply meaningful and often meditative. But with the revivals of Moody and Sunday, Christians learned to love songs that were fun to sing, highly energetic, and easy to remember. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>
