 And I commit to Thee
My soul, my way, my works, my cause.
 In Thy sole charge to be;
And my deposit, Thou, I know
Wilt guard secure from every foe.
I take Thee for my peace, O Lord.
 My heart to keep and fill
Thine own great calm, amid earth’s storms
 Shall keep me always still;
And as Thy kingdom doth increase,
So shall Thine ever-deep’ning peace.</article>
