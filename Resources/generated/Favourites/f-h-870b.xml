Every morning and evening, services were held in churches, convention halls, and theaters. Dudley Tyng, a 29 year old Episcopalian preacher, spoke to 5,000 men; 1,000 responded to the gospel invitation.
Four days later, however, Tyng was fatally injured in an accident. As he lay dying, his fellow ministers gathered around him. Tyng was still thinking about the men who had made decisions for Christ and in his last, whispered words said, "Tell them to stand up for Jesus."
Presbyterian minister George Duffield preached the next Sunday on the text "Stand therefore" (Eph 6:14) and in conclusion read a poem that he had just written entitled "Stand Up for Jesus." A church member sent the poem to a Baptist newspaper, where it was eventually published. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>
