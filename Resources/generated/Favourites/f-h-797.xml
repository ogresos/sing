Some persons around the world are already experiencing the mercy drops of revival but the showers that would water 'every one grass in the field' is yet to come. Remember, Elijah did not stop praying on mt. Carmel, until the cloud had appeared.
Let's sing it alone side "let it come oh Lord we pray Thee...", while praying it through.</article>

Fanny's arrangement and Doane's tune were then applied to Midlane's hymn also, which makes it much more enjoyable.</article>

My heart yearns for the worship of old when we walked in brokenness with a contrite heart. When sin was unheard of in our midst but love for the brethren. When we yearned for the next fellowship meeting and savoured Your presence. When Your presence filled was not far from us whenever we kneel to pray. When silver and gold, though they matter, never preoccupied us. Revive thy work O Lord and begin from me. Except a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and die, it abides alone. Help me, help me Lord. Yours I am and Yours I will always be. Amen!</article>

	<article author="Tamara De Hart" email="" city="Oceanside" provst="California" country="United States" month="4" day="2" year="2010">Our being broken and living before the Lord, His being built within us, and the church being the expression of Christâ€™s Body cannot be faked. People can sense this immediately when they meet with us. Similarly, the condition of our locality cannot be faked. It is cold or hot, poor or rich, in the flesh or in Christ. As soon as people touch us, they will touch the inward reality. Nothing is as real as spiritual matters; they cannot be faked at all.

Some people are in Christ, allowing Him to rule in them and to overflow out of them. They are persons who are broken, restricted, and ruled by the Holy Spirit. When we come into their midst, we are released and freed, regardless of how heavy a burden or how difficult a situation may be pressing upon us. As soon as we enter into a meeting with them, our entire being is released and freed. This is because there is freedom in the fullness of Christ. If the Son of God sets us free, we are free indeed. Of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace. If we live in Him and allow His fullness to be expressed, there will be something in us that sets others free.
Church as the Body of Christ, The, Chapter 11, Section 3

May the Lord have mercy on us, revive us, and make us persons who live not by ourselves but by another life which is the processed and consummated Triune God as the life-giving Spirit.</article>
