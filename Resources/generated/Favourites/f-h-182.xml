	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="26" year="2008">Please remember that it is best for any prayers offered after a hymn to follow the feeling conveyed in the hymn. For example, Hymns, #136, "In Thy face once marred and smitten, / All His glory now we read. / Gazing on it we adore Thee, / Blessed, precious, holy Lord." When we reach a high point in the spirit in our singing, we need a prayer to sustain the spirit of the meeting. This means that the words, "Gazing on it we adore Thee, / Blessed, precious, holy Lord;... / Rise our hearts," have brought us to the high point. Then instead of praying doctrinally, we should focus on the last two verses and pray, "Yes, Lord, as we are gazing on Your face, our hearts rise up to praise You." Immediately this prayer is linked to the hymn. Then more prayers should continue to focus on the Lord's glory. The atmosphere of the meeting will then be such that everyone sees the Lord's glory in its utmost purity. Hence, the author of the hymn does not need to say anything except, "Gazing on it we adore Thee, / Blessed, precious, holy Lord." If we can continue praising, the spirit of the meeting will be sustained. After numerous prayers of praise, our hearts will be fully turned to the Lord.

Then a brother may be inspired to add a short hymn and select the last stanza of Hymns, #182, which reads, "Praise Him! praise Him! praise the Savior! / Saints, aloud your voices raise, / Praise Him! praise Him! till in glory / Perfected we'll sing His praise." This is even better. After the short hymn, everyone may still have a lingering taste for the meeting; thus, we can send off the saints singing this praise once again.
