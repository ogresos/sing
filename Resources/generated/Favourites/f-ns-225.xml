May her spirit and the flavor of glory that so inspired this song permeate the hearts that sing this, being made ready for the God of glory to appear to them!</article>
	<article author="Mary Ha" email="hahasoawesome123@gmail.com" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="29" year="2015">God of glory, God of glory,             
Do appear to us today,
Saturate and permeate us
Till You fully have Your way.
From that evil foreign land.
Get out, get out, from Chaldea,
Come in, come in, to the good land,
Christ, the church, the one new man.
Lord, we’re crossing every river—
For this You must call us on,
Till Your kingdom and expression
On this earth are fully come.
God of glory, God of glory,
Do appear to us each day,
Call us out into Your building,
Your desire on earth today.
This is such an enjoyable hymn. This should be our daily prayer</article>

Thank God He is everything to me, and we're enjoying Him daily (me, my wife and little baby Victoria). Praise The Lord I need to be more attached to Him now :)</article>

	<article author="Bonnie Chan" email="" city="Palo Alto" provst="CA" country="United States" month="6" day="3" year="2009">I was enjoying this song one morning and it touched me very much. Not long after I was at the Memorial Day Conference in Philly, and the Lord reminded me of this song during Message Four, "The Recovery of Living the Life of the Altar and the Tent."  It's such a fitting song for this message. I am still singing it as my prayer and constitution from the message so that the Lord can make this my reality in my living for the church.</article>
