	<article author="Igor Savinkin" email="igor.savinkin@gmail.com" city="Riga" provst="" country="Latvia" month="11" day="22" year="2014">I do enjoy this sweet, the Triune God's love and care expounding hymn. We do need to speak the high peak truth, which indeed being the deep truth. 'Deep' implies it is able to touch 'my deepest parts', that is our spirit along with our mind, emotions, will. I like that this hymn does it in simple, story-telling way. Could you ever leverage/appy the Luke 15 parables to believers' experience? 'Your tender loving care', 'sweeping in my deepest parts', 'eagerly awaiting me', 'fell upon my neck'. Each believer, I think, is tired of ourward things, vanity and seeks for the reality, the deep touch with the Father, Son and Spirit as the cosummate Spirit in them. 
May Lord bring us on for the deeper experiencing Him, this hymn being the means for believers to apprehend and enter into our dear processed and consummated Triune God. 
As I was writing this comment I felt to recommend this hymn to one of my Christian friends.</article>

My life indeed has been a wreck. These past weeks I have been squandering my time seeking after worldly love, pleasure, and vain things of emptiness. Eventually, all these things have led to nothing. Even among the worldliest people, I am considered a vulgar failure.
But although I am the worst, the Lord still ran to me after the slightest turn. Hallelujah for His love and grace!</article>

	<article author="Sandy Williams" email="sandyw148@hotmail.com" city="Brampton" provst="ON" country="Canada" month="12" day="7" year="2013">Sat in a quiet time this morning and let the sweetness of these words wash over my being. Thank You Triune God for Your determined stubborn love toward each of us. You sought us, called us by name, carried us, saved us by putting us into the church life. 

Coming out of the denominations and into the church life floored me, that such a way to meet exists in the earth! Oh, a way to love and pursue our Triune God together. No one knows how lonely and lost I was in a crowded denomination! I did not know God's eternal purpose, I ran around trying to find "my ministry or my gift" and missed knowing this wonderful Christ. Lord have mercy, but I did not even know my regenerated mingled spirit!

WHAT A RESCUING! To be brought to be with the saints, I am not alone anymore. I don't have to try and figure anything out anymore. And its beautiful because we all know that we are weak and full of shortages, but Hallelujah! We have the Lord and each other. We flee, we pursue, we call together. The Lord would complete the good work in us as His one Body. 

Lord Jesus, thank You for bringing us all together, for building us into You, and You into us. What a gospel today! Hallelujah.</article>

Laid me on Your shoulders there, You bore me in
Your tender loving care" I love You Lord :)</article>

	<article author="Abimbola Waddell" email="" city="Manchester" provst="Lanc" country="United Kingdom" month="9" day="7" year="2012">This song ministers a lot to me and since have heard it l am so addicted to it and it brings joy to my heart each time l listen to it (l do not know how to sing it very well yet) and there is a new meaning. God's love and affection is so deep to me l can't just comprehend it.</article>
	<article author="Daniel Chen" email="" city="Potomac" provst="Maryland" country="United States" month="7" day="2" year="2012">This really touched me:
"Sweeping in my deepest parts,
You lit a lamp and searched my inward heart,
Sanctifying deep within You shined in me,
Exposed me of my sin;
Repenting—now I see
Lord, You're sprinkling me—with the blood You shed for me."</article>

	<article author="Adjoa Nyarko" email="" city="New York City" provst="NY" country="U.S.A." month="8" day="25" year="2005">This is the first time hearing the song on Hymnal.net and I just love it. I just feel like telling all the young people in the Church in NYC. This song has just brought me back to God's sweet will for us. People always feel the Bible only pertains to what was going on in that time it was return. But we, the Church, know that the Lord is moving today.

O LORD JESUS! Saints, stanza one says, "There's a gospel of today that says believe! And be saved!" It doesn't stop there because in the same stanza it says it "fails to treat all the vanity that is hidden in me". The first stanza is concerning Christianity today. But the second stanza is concerning the Lord's Recovery. Being the Triune God, all of God's fulness as the Spirit within us, reaching the saints, making His home in our hearts, and spreading into our souls and very being. Becoming "the one reality". Experiencing His love untold.</article>
	<article author="" email="" city="Anaheim" provst="CA" country="U.S.A." month="7" day="23" year="2005">This song was the first song I ever sang when I got into the church life, and the song that saved me.</article>
	<article author="Malcolm" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="6" day="12" year="2005">The lyrics of this song are so true. For a long time this is the Gospel I believed and tried so HARD to be excited about it. All the preachers were excited, but I felt so left out. Then I realize this is PART of the Gospel. The Gospel is God becoming man to save me, then becoming the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor 15:45) to enter into me and give me all He accomplished on Calvary and His divine life!</article>
	<article author="" email="" city="" provst="CA" country="U.S.A." month="4" day="19" year="2004">I like this song. I am so happy that I made it as a young person in the Lord's recovery. At school, there are too many unbelievers. We need to preach that THERE'S A GOSPEL TODAY.</article>
	<article author="" email="" city="Seattle" provst="WA" country="U.S.A." month="6" day="21" year="2003">This song is one of my favorites because no matter what my day or my life has been like He is always eagerly awaiting. I'm 18 and I was the only one at my school who was in the church life and I felt blessed. I look at the lives of my friends and classmates around me and I'm always thankful that i made it.</article>
