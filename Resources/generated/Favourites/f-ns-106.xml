	<article author="Kwamboka Nyambati" email="" city="Nairobi" provst="Nairobi" country="Kenya" month="3" day="16" year="2008">It is good to know that there are people out there who are trully inspired by the Holy Spirit hence able to write such wonderful  and fullfilling songs in the 21st century. I myself I am forever moved by thios. I am hence encouraged from now henceforth to also consider todays noble song writers and not linger only on the old hymn writers. Amin to God who inspired the writer and composer of this and many other wonderful songs. Amin.</article>

It tells me that we should pursue the Lord "until He comes again." Though we may sin" country="His blood will cleanse us. He died and rose to live in us, and His life is within us. We should all wait, watch, and call on Him "until He comes again." I truly enjoy listening to this song. Amen!</article>
