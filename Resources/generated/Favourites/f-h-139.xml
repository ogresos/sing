    <article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="3" day="2" year="2013">After being a minister in the Anglican Church for some time, Edward Perronet became fed up with what he felt was the church's "nonsense" and became a Methodist, joining up with the Wesleys. As a Methodist he faced persecution. On at least 1 occasion, "Edward Perronet was thrown down and rolled in the mud and mire," as John Wesley recorded.
Perronet soon broke with the Wesleys over the issue of who could administer the sacraments. He joined a group called the Connexion but later broke with them as well. It was as minister of an independent church in Canterbury that he wrote this majestic hymn.
Whether Perronet intended the implication or not, the hymn points to the time all believers in Christ - regardless of petty disagreements - will join together in a celestial chorus. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>

    <article author="Barbara Felix" email="" city="Miami" provst="Florida" country="United States" month="12" day="8" year="2010">I use this site to prepare my heart through hymns to worship and read His Word. This morning as I sang this song and read the comments, I was blessed by the comments of others, and was reminded how much we bless each other as we share. I decided to take time to share. God has use hymns to quiet my wandering soul, and I thank Him for this ministry and the obedience of sisters and brothers who I may never meet until we arrive at the feet of our Lord and Saviour. Thank You Lord for their ministry to us who listen and sing along each day. This is a blessed site. I found it one day, and share it as often as the Lord calls it out. Together we will worship forever at His throne. Thank You Lord for the gifted fingers that lift up the music of this song so well. This song opens Revelation Chapter 4.</article>
