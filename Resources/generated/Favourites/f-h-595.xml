Even when we feel like we're going from strength to nothing, we need to stand on the facts. Our God is more than able in each circumstanceâ€”it might not seem so outwardly, but when we turn to our spirit, we realize that there's far more than just what meets our meager needs. Our God is overflowing and there is always something over!</article>

This song is very precious. It helped me turned today from my view of the situation to Christ, to His sovereignty, to appreciate His wisdom and His plans.
Lord have mercy on me, wretched sinner, I praise You for Your heart toward us, for Your plans, for Your sovereignty in all matters. I love You Beloved. Thank You for each portion. Hallelujah! Gracias por todo mi Senor. (Thank You for everything my Lord) I love You again.</article>

It was all very well for apostles to say to an unbeliever who himself was in distress, "Silver and gold I do not possess," but it would never have done for a needy apostle to say that to believers who would be ready to respond to an appeal for help. It is a dishonor to the Lord if any representative of His discloses needs that would provoke pity on the part of others. If we have a living faith in God, we shall always make our boast in Him, and we shall dare to proclaim under every circumstance, "I have received in full all things and abound."
