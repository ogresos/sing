There is no God except the Creator of heaven, earth and everything between. That's why this song is so powerful. The God of the universe is God all by Himself! No rivals! No contest!

	<article author="dulce han" email="" city="tagaytay city" provst="cavite" country="Philippines" month="10" day="17" year="2008">I really love this song! It's really our experience.

This song is very touching to me. His grace, his mercy and peace toward us is exceedingly wonderful! We need to enjoy the Lord in a practical way.

	<article author="Titus Kang" email="" city="North Shore" provst="" country="New Zealand" month="10" day="22" year="2006">I love this song because it is very subjective to our experience of Lord in daily life. Most of time, we live in our mind according to our natural man. We use our natural patience and endurance to deal with our problems and eventually it runs out. But then as we get exposed, the Lord starts to work in us to be our real strength and power to overcome our situations. How we need enjoy the Lord as grace!</article>

	<article author="Christian Liu" email="" city="Toronto" provst="Ontario" country="Canada" month="3" day="7" year="2003">This song is a REALLY experiential and motivational song to me for all seasons. Whenever I experience greater or increased burdens in my situations, I will simply remember that the Lord gives me MORE grace! That He will never forsake me no matter what, whenever I faithfully commit matters unto Him. And I can still remember to praise and thank the Lord for His wonderful grace in the midst of the big or small burdens/labors which are coming my way every now and then. Praise the Lord for His bountiful and unlimited grace bestowed on me!</article>
