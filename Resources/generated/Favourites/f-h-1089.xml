I remember singing it in church when I was a teenager. The words are so simple, but the message is so powerful!

If you from sin are longing to be free,
Look to the Lamb of God.
He to redeem you died on Calvary,
Look to the Lamb of God.

Refrain

Look to the Lamb of God.
Look to the Lamb of God.
For He alone is able to save you,
Look to the Lamb of God.

When Satan tempts and doubts and fears
  assail,
Look to the Lamb of God.
You in His strength shall over all prevail,
Look to the Lamb of God.

Are you aweary? Does the way seem long?
Look to the Lamb of God.
His love will cheer and fill your heart
  with song.
Look to the Lamb of God.

Fear not when shadows on your pathway fall,
Look to the Lamb of God.
In joy or sorrow, Christ is all in all.
Look to the Lamb of God.

God bless us all as we keeping looking to the Lamb!</article>
