	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="9" day="27" year="2014">Miss Eliza (Edmunds should be spelled with a "u" rather than "o".) Hewitt was a school teacher but became debilitated by a spinal condition that may have come from a boy striking her in the back with a heavy slate while he was being disciplined. She was put in a heavy cast for 6 months. She wrote this hymn after getting her body cast off and being allowed a walk in the nearby park, in thankfulness at the joy of being able to get about again! (more on her under the hymn "My Faith has Found a Resting Place".) - from bereanbibleheritage</article>

I have found this wonderful hymn after 50 years. It was a special hymn in my local church in Yorkshire, always the favourite of a blind preacher who often visited us - I remember how his face always shone when he sang this hymn &amp; he was such a wonderful storyteller.</article>

	<article author="Jack" email="" city="" provst="Kansas" country="United States" month="11" day="23" year="2012">Every so often music memories provide a relief and an uplift that is unexpected. This morning I was struggling with an interpersonal relationship memory that tends to be very depressing. I hit a point when I needed to pray for help to move away from it. Gently, as I prayed, this song came back to me from 50 years ago or more. Now, my sunshine is back.</article>

	<article author="Donna" email="" city="Denton" provst="TX" country="United States" month="1" day="8" year="2011">We sang this song when I was a little girl. And then on school days, when Dad would drop me off early at school and there was no one else there, I'd sing this song at the top of my lungs, and listen to it echo on the walls of the school buildings all around.</article>
