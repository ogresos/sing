    <article author="Taryn" email="" city="Indianapolis" provst="IN" country="" month="9" day="28" year="2013">Saw the golden glow off the western maple trees in my backyard this morning and thought of this song. Wanted to find the lyrics. Looks like there are quite a few verses, all reasons and remembrances: May Jesus Christ be praised!</article>

There are many more stanzas which were not translated from the German at first. 
Insert after stanza 2:
When you begin the day, 
O never fail to say,
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
 And at your work rejoice, 
to sing with heart and voice,
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
--------------------------------
Whene’er the sweet church bell
 peals over hill and dell,
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
 O hark to what it sings,
 as joyously it rings,
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
-----------------------------------------------
My tongue shall never tire 
of chanting with the choir,
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
 This song of sacred joy, 
it never seems to cloy,
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
------------------------------
Insert between stanzas 4 and 5:
To God, the Word, on high, 
the host of angels cry,
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
 Let mortals, too, upraise 
their voice in hymns of praise,
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
--------------------------------
Be this at meals your grace, 
in every time and place;
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
 Be this, when day is past, 
of all your thoughts the last
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
-----------------------------
When mirth for music longs, 
this is my song of songs:
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
 When evening shadows fall, 
this rings my curfew call,
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
------------------------------------
before last stanza:
The night becomes as day 
when from the heart we say:
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
 The powers of darkness fear 
when this sweet chant they hear:
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
----------------------------------
No lovelier antiphon 
in all high Heav’n is known
 Than, Jesus Christ be praised!
 There to the eternal Word 
the eternal psalm is heard:
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
------------------------------------
Let all the earth around 
ring joyous with the sound:
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
 In Heaven’s eternal bliss 
the loveliest strain is this:
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
--------------------------------
Sing, suns and stars of space, 
sing, ye that see His face,
 Sing, Jesus Christ be praised!
 God’s whole creation o’er, 
for aye and evermore
 Shall Jesus Christ be praised!
--------------------------------
In Heav’n’s eternal bliss 
the loveliest strain is this,
 May Jesus Christ be praised!
 Let earth, and sea and sky
 from depth to height reply,
 May Jesus Christ be praised!</article>
    <article author="Julie Sutton" email="" city="Winfield" provst="KS" country="United States" month="2" day="3" year="2011">This is the song God used to reach me years before I knew Him. Something about the refrain grabbed me and made me want to praise Him, but at the time I did not even know what that meant. It still has the same effect, only now I understand the joy and majesty behind it, since He has given me new life!</article>
    <article author="morine king" email="" city="bridgetown" provst="st michael" country="Barbados" month="8" day="12" year="2009">Praise Him with trumpet and song. Praise Him with cymbals and dances. Let everything that has breath praise the Lord! When morning gilds the sky may Jesus Christ be praised, Amen.</article>
