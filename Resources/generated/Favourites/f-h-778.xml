The second thing he will do is to tell us that God's promise is not real. He will base his words on the environment he has created. Once I was sick. I prayed and God promised that He would heal me. I had the faith for the healing, but after three weeks, the sickness became worse. Then Satan came and tempted me, saying, "What good is your faith? Your illness is still here." When I prayed again, God rebuked me, saying, "Why are you still praying? I have told you that I will heal you. Why do you still have to pray?" I immediately began to praise. I said, "God, I cannot sleep, and I feel much pain. Satan is troubling me all over. Yet I praise You because Your Word is true. I do not care if I suffer. Only Your Word counts; only it is trustworthy. The environment is just Satan's performance. You alone are faithful and trustworthy." I began to sing Hymn #778 on my bed. That was the best singing I ever experienced in my life. The words in stanza two were particularly precious: "For God delights when faith can praise /Though dark the night and long." Later the Lord did heal me. Satan's work produces only one resultâ€”doubting God's Word, that is, making men wonder whether or not it is true. Outward conditions are not real. If you listen to Satan and look at the adverse environment, you will think that God's Word is not true. But if you stand on God's Word by faith, you will not fear.
