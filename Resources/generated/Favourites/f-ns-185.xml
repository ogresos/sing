	<article author="Dora Nineth Yao" email="" city="Long Island" provst="NY" country="United States" month="4" day="19" year="2009">I learned this song many years ago when I was in the YP meetings.  Oh Lord...."the spirit of the prophet is subject to the prophet."...I often remember this song when I "don't feel like it" ...when I "don't feel like being in the meetings" when...I'm not in the "mood"..the Lord reminds me this little hymn!...I DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR A BETTER DAY...I CAN TURN RIGHT NOW...!  Praise the Lord I don't have to live according to my feeling!  What a salvation that is...there is nothing in my being that longs to seek Him...except His overcoming life in me!  Thank you Lord for Your life in me....not an ordinary life..but an overcoming life..the eternal life!!!!</article>
