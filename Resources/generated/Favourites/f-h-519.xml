    <article author="GEOFF SHERWOOD" city="WORCESTER" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="2" day="15" year="2010">On the night my granddad was saved, at a tent meeting, this hymn was sung and his family recalled how he sang this hymn most of the night, afterwards! His was a true conversion and following on from that he lead the rest of his family to the Lord. I owe a lot to him.</article>
    <article author="Daniel Jackson" city="Reading" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="10" day="3" year="2002">I always enjoy singing this hymn simply because it brings me back to the realization that Christ is the only important thing in the universe. Everything else, be it money, education, people, the future, whatever - "it will waste and wear away."

I pray that the Lord would allow this to be my constant experience: "My heart is fixed, eternal God, fixed on Thee, fixed on Thee; And my immortal choice is made - Christ for me! Christ for me! He is my Prophet, Priest, and King, who did for me salvation bring; And while I've breath I mean to sing - Christ for me! Christ for me!"</article>
