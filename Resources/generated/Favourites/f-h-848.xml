The main function of a priest is not to work but to spend in the presence of the Lord until he or she is one with Him in the Spirit!! Lord, here I am, not ready to work but to be filled and possessed by You and to be one with You"</article>

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="6" day="1" year="2012">In Christianity today too much emphasis is placed on the function of the prophet, a preacher of the word. Stanza 4 of Hymns, #848 says, "Through the weakness of their spirits / Preaching doth predominate." This describes today's abnormal situation in which the function of preachers, as ministers of the word, is dominant among Christians. I am heavily burdened because God desires priests and kings for the fulfillment of His purpose. Prophets are supplementary in this regard. In the Old Testament, prophets were not needed when the condition of God's people was normal. They were needed primarily when His people were weak, childish, foolish, and in darkness.

When the children of Israel came out of Egypt, Moses represented the kingship, and Aaron represented the priesthood. Among them there were no prominent prophets. Although Moses was also considered to be a prophet, his service in this capacity was far less significant than the authority that he bore for God. Moses' sister, Miriam, also was a prophetess, but her function did not compare to the priesthood of Aaron and the kingship of Moses.

This does not mean that there is no place for prophets or ministers of the word in the church. It means that the prophethood is supplementary and remedial. In the Old Testament the prophets were needed when the children of Israel were in desolate situations. Elijah and Elisha were raised up to speak to the children of Israel when the temple was closed, the priestly service had ceased, and the kings were in disarray. When David lived properly before God, there was no need for prophets, but when David stumbled, there was a need for Nathan and Gad to serve as prophets (2 Sam. 12:7-15; 24:10-14). When David committed a sin, a prophet was needed. When he had a problem, the remedy came through a prophet.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="26" year="2008">Stanza 4 of Hymns, #848 says concerning the priesthood, "Through the church's degradation, / Saints this office desolate; / Through the weakness of their spirits / Preaching doth predominate." The priestly office is desolated through the church's degradation. In today's Christian churches we can hear much preaching, but when people are asked to pray, many are as silent as a tomb. When preaching predominates, it means that there is the ministry of the prophets, but there are no priests or kings. There is the gift, but there is no life. I say again, we were born to be priests and kings. The priesthood and the kingship are a matter of our new birth. If we want to have the gift of prophecy, we may desire it, but that is not something of our birthright.
