We must learn to rejoice in all kinds of situations. Our situation will pass away. The reality is that we are preparing for our Bridegroom's coming. This is one thing we can be sure of. Let's be sober-minded. Rejoice at the real situation!</article>
    <article author="Berean Steward II" email="" city="Columbus" provst="North Dakota" country="United States" month="4" day="6" year="2011">We have so much to rejoice concerning in the midst of so many negative events, such as the global economic collapse, great earthquakes in divers places, nuclear radiation, floods, cold, fires, crop failures resulting in shortages and famine, and increasing lawlessness and violence upon the earth. 

Not only on earth, but we are witnessing record breaking temperatures along with bizarre weather, solar flares with coronal mass ejections, an approaching comet, Elinen, and the mysterious planet X also known as Nibiru, and Wormwood in the heavens above earth. 

Yet in the midst of all this upheaval, the holy saints of God are rejoicing and rejoicing as they love the appearing of the Lord in their hope of His soon to be appearing. Our dear Bridegroom is coming, and with His coming in view, we are filled with great hope as we run to Him to meet Him in all of His glory and splendor, and nothing on this earth can weigh us down, for we are truly leaving this world to meet our Bridegroom to be with Him for ever and ever. 

So, do not be dismayed concerning what is coming upon the earth, and what is transpiring in the heavens, for it will not be long. Our Bridegroom is coming!!! Praise the Lord! Look up and keep looking up, and rejoice and rejoice. 

Rejoice in the Lord always even in the coming tears which you must endure, for it will truly not be long, and then, what a feast we will have with our dear Lord Jesus Christ, our Bridegroom. 

"Blessed are all they that put their trust in Him" (Psalm 2:12b).</article>
