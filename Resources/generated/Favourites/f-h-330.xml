	<article author="Danny Kreiser" email="dfkreiser@gmail.com" city="Braden" provst="TN" country="United States" month="3" day="26" year="2016">I was born into a devout home where daily Bible reading and prayer were a normal part of life. I prayed to receive Christ at an early age and gradually became more and more involved in church as the years went by. But alas, in spite of all my activity in church I had no lasting assurance of salvation and I was plagued by doubts and fears. Finally, in desperation, at 40 years of age, I cried out to God for help. By divine appointment I came under the preaching of a man sent by God (Rom. 10:14-15). Under Holy Ghost conviction I was made ready to receive Christ Jesus the LORD and my faith came to rest in Him! (1 Thes. 1:5) For all these years I‚Äôd been trying various ‚Äòthings‚Äô to get God to save me. (John 5:40, Rom. 14:17) I‚Äôd been down the church aisle, down the ‚ÄòRoman Road‚Äô, prayed a hundred prayers asking God to save, been baptized, lived by a good creed; but I didn‚Äôt have Him! But now:     
‚ÄúMy faith has found a resting place, Not in device nor creed;
I trust the ever living One,
His wounds for me shall plead.‚Äù
Hallelujah!!!</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="9" day="27" year="2014">This hymn is written by Eliza Edmunds Hewitt. Lidie H. Edmunds was a pseudonym she used.
She was born and spent her life in Philadelphia, PA. Her father was a sea captain. They were wealthy before the Civil War, but lost 80% of their assets by 1870. 
She attended Philadelphia public schools and graduated valedictorian of her class at the Girl's Normal School of Philadelphia and became a school teacher. She became bedridden because of a spinal condition that may have come from a boy striking her in the back with a heavy slate while being disciplined. She was put in a heavy cast for 6 months. She wrote ‚ÄúThere Is Sunshine in My Soul Today‚Äù after getting her body cast off and being allowed a walk in the nearby park, in thankfulness at the joy of being able to get about again!
As an invalid for an extended period, she developed a love of God and the Scriptures and the hope of sharing in written form. She wrote Sunday School literature and children's poems. She wrote a poem for her pastor during this time entitled "Winning Souls for Jesus" and it was placed in the cornerstone of Tabernacle Presbyterian Church of West Philadelphia. Professor J. R. Sweeny saw some of her work and wrote to her asking for some contributions he could put to music (i.e. "More About Jesus Would I Know" &amp; "There is Sunshine in My Soul Today"). This led to her becoming known by Professor W. J. Kirkpatrick, and she wrote most of her poems for him to use.
Her mother, Zeruiah Edmunds Hewitt, died during this time in 1880 when Eliza was 28.
Her condition eventually improved and she was able to return to an active life in Christian ministry. She was very committed to reaching children through Sunday Schools and attended the Methodist Camp meetings in Ocean Grove, New Jersey. She worked with the Methodist District Superintendant‚Äôs wife, Emily Wilson, on the hymn poem, ‚ÄúWhen We All Get to Heaven.‚Äù Her goal was to reach children through her poems with the message of the gospel. She was the superintendent of the Sunday school at the Northern Home for Friendless Children and an active member of the Mt. Olivet Presbyterian Church of Philadelphia.
She was a close friend of Fanny Crosby and the two often met to have fellowship and talk about hymns. She was a cousin of the hymn writer, Edgar Page Stites, and worked with other well known hymn writers like Charles Gabriel, Homer Rodeheaver, and E.S. Lorenz. - extracted from bereanbibleheritage
