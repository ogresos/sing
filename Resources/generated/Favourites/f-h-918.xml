O Zion, haste, thy mission high fulfilling,
In stanza 4, line 2, the original says "live and move" according to Acts 17:28 instead of "move and live". (I don't see a reason for that change. It may have been a mistake.)
Also in stanza 4, the original last line said:
And died on earth that man might live above.

One night in 1868, a worried mother sat up with one of her children who was critically ill. She prayed to the Lord to heal her child. She realized how quickly her comfortable life style was jolted by the reality of something really important. And what is really important to God is the evangelization of the world. If God raised up her child, would she be willing to see him go out as a missionary to a continent like Africa, where David Livingstone was lost in the interior? Out of her inner wrestling with such questions, 34 year old Mary Ann Thomson wrote these words. 
This hymn blends the messianic pronouncement of Isaiah 52 with the missionary call of Romans 10. For over 100 years this hymn has stirred thousands to respond to God's call. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown and Norton</article>

Often during the day at an awkward time, in a way I didn't expect, He brings the opportunity to share the gospel as an answer to my prayer. He opened the way for me at that moment to share some word or give out a tract. "The Son of Man came to seek and save the lost" (Luke 19:10). "...woe to me if I do not preach the gospel" (1 Corinthians 9:16b)</article>
