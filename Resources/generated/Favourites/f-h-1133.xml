There are so many good points that are mentioned in this hymn: a spirit of wisdom and revelation, the hope of God's calling, the glory of His inheritance in the saints, the enlightening of the eyes of our hearts, etc.
We need to pray in this way daily to see more of God's economy and to experience the riches of Christ in our living. Hallelujah for the revelation in Ephesians 1!</article>
