Five or six hundred year ago, there was a person by the name of Miss Bride who was greatly used by the Lord to perform miracles. She laid hands on Dara, and the little sister, who was born blind and who was then in her teens, recovered her sight. After Miss Bride prayed for her, her eyes were opened and everything around was new to her. She was very happy and greatly enjoyed the sight of the sun, the moon, the stars, and everything around her. After a few days, however, she went back to Miss Bride in great sorrow. When Miss Bride asked her what she wanted, she said she wanted someone to pray for her again. Miss Bride asked, "Do you have some other illness?" She answered, "Please pray for me to have my eyes blind again. The beautiful scenery is distracting me from the Lord." Later Miss Bride put Dara's words together in a poem and composed [a song]. We can see that this is a song from the heart of one who is absolutely single for the Lord. It shows us the kind of attitude such a person has towards the world.

In this aspect the elders should not fall behind the young ones; they should not be behind in consecration. Admittedly, the older brothers and sisters may not be able to match the young people in evangelism, zeal, or energy, but they should not say that they cannot match the young people in consecration and love for the Lord. If they do, this is an admission that they ahve received less light and grace than the young people.

And my prayer is that when put back into our daily living environment, we would remain blinded to the world and keep gazing at Him only and not the distracting world.</article>
    <article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="4" day="9" year="2008">The following hymn was written about a person, Dara, whose heart was most sincere and whose spirit was most pure towards the Lord. It speaks of the proper attitude a man of God should have towards the world. As we sing this song, we touch a spirit whose purity rarely has been found in the past five hundred years. As we learn to touch the Lord's Spirit with our spirit and as we turn our heart fully to the Lord as the writer did, we can lay aside every earthly possession.
