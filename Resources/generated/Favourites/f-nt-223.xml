  <article author="Annie" city="Taipei" country="Taiwan" month="10" day="15" year="2008">While I listened to the hymn, it seemed I was brought into the vision that the Lord suffered on the cross for us, I was touched along with the music.
His wounded side speaks again to me, how His blood for washing of sin, and the water for imparting life . Praise the Lord for His great love.
%u201CBy the shedding of Thy blood, God becomes our all in all.%u201D</article>
    <article author="Hymnal.Net" month="3" day="31" year="2008">[Psalms 16] Verse 5 says, "Jehovah is the portion of My inheritance and of My cup;/You maintain My lot." God is the portion of two things: of the inheritance and of the cup. The inheritance refers to the substance of the lot, and the cup refers to the enjoyment of God as our blessing. At the Lord's table, we drink the cup of blessing (1 Cor. 10:16a). Stanza 3 of Hymns, #223 points out that in this cup God is our portion. Thus, we have God as the portion for our inheritance and for our enjoyment. God the Father was the very portion of these two things to Christ as a man on this earth. Verse 5b says, "You maintain My lot." The lot is the portion of the inheritance.
