	<article author="IrisCrystal Seok" email="tgnrsvt@yahoo.com" city="" provst="" country="South Korea" month="8" day="17" year="2014">With relation to this scriptural song from Ruth in the Old Testament, I‚Äôd like share one of the forerunner‚Äôs messages in our path of pursuing the Lord. When I encountered it many years ago, it was a deep night I‚Äôd been passing through under the Lord‚Äôs sovereignty, and that touching moment in the Lord and the unforgettable message from that brother along with another message of ‚Äòconsecration‚Äô in ‚ÄúExperience of Life‚Äù and ‚Äòthe principle of Nazarite‚Äô in ‚ÄúPriesthood‚Äù with relation to Numbers chapter 6, was deeply inscribed in a believer‚Äôs being accordingly, as a kind of guidepost for gauging own genuine spiritual authenticity. It reads: 
In the Lord‚Äôs recovery, should we take the way of the judges to be powerful and to do a great work? If we take the way of the judges instead of the way of Life, whatever we accomplish will mean nothing. Not one judge was a forefather of Christ. The judges had nothing to do with keeping the line in humanity to bring in God in His incarnation. It was Ruth and Boaz who participated in keeping this line. However, they did not fight a war; they did not exercise any power. 
  It is crucial for us to see that only Life can bring Christ forth. Only Life can keep the lineage, maintaining the thin line to bring God into humanity, to produce Christ and to minister Christ and to supply the entire human race with Christ. This was done not by the judges but by Ruth and Boaz, who took the way of Life.
  In the Lord‚Äôs recovery, I have very much promoted the gaining of the increase, but I do not mean that we should try to gain the increase by being a Samson or a Gideon. I would rather have no increase and keep my genuineness in Life. I would rather be without any power, without any result from the work, and remain in the line that brings forth Christ out of eternity into time, that brings forth Christ with His divinity into humanity. ( ‚Äî from the Life-Study of Ruth)
  Thank you very much for sharing this song on this web and I'm sorry about not being able to share such a beautiful vocal song of this hymn sung by some brothers and sisters!</article>
	<article author="Êùé Ëè≤ È∫ó" email="" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="1" day="20" year="2012">In this new year,this hymn has reminded me what is my goal, my direction and NOT to be swerved and diverted from God. Ruth chose the goal of participating with God‚Äôs elect in the enjoyment of Christ, and she even became a top ancestor of Christ who helped bring forth Christ into mankind. This was more than just a resolution on the part of the Moabite widow; it was a GOAL, a CHOOSING. Ruth chose God and His kingdom for the carrying out of God‚Äôs economy concerning Christ. Hallelujah for such a goal and for such a person choosing this goal! O Lord Jesus! May I be such a person!</article>
