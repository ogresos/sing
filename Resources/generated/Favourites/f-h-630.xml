We need the cross in our Christian life, especially in our service in the church. May we be found faithful in ministering to the saints for the building of His body all the days of our lives till the Lord comes back.</article>

 How easy to say, We give all;
 Till some rougher cross lies just before,
 And sterner is duty's call.

5 Care not for pers'nal loss or gain
 To the will of God take heed
 If we count but refuse all things of earth
 His plan can then proceed. 

How easy it is for us to say "Amen" when the Lord asks for light things, but when He asks for something dear to us, do we say "Amen" with no second thoughts? 

May we pray that the Lord grant us strength and a submissive will to simply allow Him to work into us, that we become luminaries lighting up this dark world.</article>

What does bearing the Cross mean to ME? I who've given MYself, MY all to God! To God am I wholly true?</article>
