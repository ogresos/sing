Keep us all in the healthy teaching of the apostles. Let all our hearts be renewed to love you like the day we first met you.</article>
	<article author="Gonzalo &amp; Eunice Garcia" email="" city="" provst="New York" country="U.S.A." month="1" day="27" year="2005">Why I like this song. The heart is where the Lord wants to make His home (Eph. 3:17a), because the Lord is a Gentleman, everything depends on our cooperation. The heart is composed of three parts, the mind, emotion, will plus the conscience, which is the leading part of our spirit. How wonderful to know our God wants us to be His home for His corporate expression and also to subdue the earth and have dominion over it (Gen. 1:26-28). Oh how precious it is to have hymns like this to encourage us to love the Lord and cooperate with Him by His "constraining love"-I love You Lord, dearest Lord, I love You, I just love You! AMEN.</article>

	<article author="" email="" city="Irving" provst="TX" country="U.S.A." month="10" day="15" year="2002">I had very much been enjoying this song when I received a letter from my firstborn son, who is in prison. He is taking a class in horticulture there. The Lord had mercy on him because his "lab" (we can call it) is in a greenhouse. He said that when he was in there, that it was his time to be alone and spend time with the Lord. He asked me to send him the words to some songs that would keep him. He requested "Nothing's quite so precious" and any others that I could think of that he knew the tune. I have sent both of them to him. This song runs through my mind quite often, drawing me to the Lord, then to pray for my son. It is very comforting to think that sometimes he and I could be singing this song to the Lord at the same time.</article>
