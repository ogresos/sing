Oh how refreshing it is just to call upon His name. It all started in the 3rd generation, when "men began to call upon the name of Jehovah". Jesus actually means Jehovah the Savior or Jehovah saves. How we need to be saved from so many things. Even more so, when we call upon the name of the Lord Jesus, "the devil's trembling". Oh Lord Jesus! Out of loving You we call upon Your name. Thank You for giving to us Your name. May we never be ashamed of calling upon Your name. Remind us dear Lord at any time and at every place we can call. We love You-we love Your name. AMEN.</article>
