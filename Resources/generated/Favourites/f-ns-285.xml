En devenant pareils à Christ 
En vie, nature, expression et fonction,
Nous sommes qualifiés pour travailler 
Avec Lui pour Son Corps.
En dépendant désespérément 
De Lui comme amour et force,
En écoutant Ses paroles,
Notre espoir est d’être enlevé par la rédemption 
De notre corps.
Et nous prions :
« Viens, Seigneur Jésus ! »
Et nous prions :
« Viens, Seigneur Jésus ! »
« Viens, Seigneur Jésus !
Seigneur Jésus, viens ! »</article>

The Lord was telling me that through His redemption, and becoming the same as He is, in life, nature, expression and function, we are qualified to work with Him for His body.
That word Qualified made it clear to me, that Christ desire is not our working but His working Himself into us so He can build His Body.</article>

	<article author="Mariah" email="" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="8" day="28" year="2009">Amen. Come Lord Jesus! 

I am realizing what a need there is for a vision! We need to pray each morning during our personal time with the Lord for a vision! A vision to focus on throughout the day. We need to pray that we and all the saints would be useful and active that day. We cannot be passive! There have been many passive Christians in the past, but that is just not acceptable now. We are part of a new age that will bring the Lord Jesus back! We cannot be passive. 

I am finding that choosing a verse or two in Revelation and pray reading them every morning is really changing my daily life. We are not just pursuing, we are pursuing toward the goal! I pray that all saints, especially the young people, realize this!

I am a young person, but that doesn't mean I have the right to be passive! Reading "The worlds situation and Gods move" helped me realize that as an American young person in the church life, I have a big responsibility!</article>

當我們在生命、性情、彰顯和功用上，成為與基督一樣，
我們就彀資格為著祂的身體與祂同工。

當我們無依無靠的信靠主，倚靠祂作我們的愛和力量，
並且聽祂說話，我們的盼望就是藉著身體的得贖而被提，
我們的禱告乃是：『主耶穌阿，我願你來！』</article>
