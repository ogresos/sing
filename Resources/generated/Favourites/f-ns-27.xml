    <article author="Steven Tan" city="Bayan Lepas" provst="Penang" country="Malaysia" month="1" day="18" year="2011">All the trainings in the recovery are not for us to gain something but to make us NOTHING. When we have nothing, be nothing and see nothing we can enjoy the Christ in glory. Praise the Lord that Christ is everything, He is all-inclusive and all-extensive!</article>
    <article author="Lemuel Ian B. Cua" city="Zamboanga City" provst="" country="Philippines" month="3" day="9" year="2010">I heard the tune of this song since I was 5 years old, but praise the Lord I am able to hear it again. A normal Christian does not care for anything in this world, but cares for God's interest, God's motive, and God's plan: God's economy....(^_^)....</article>
    <article author="Jack Yu" city="Auckland" provst="" country="New Zealand" month="10" day="21" year="2009">This is the first song that I sang in the meeting. It is also my first meeting with the saints in the local church. Didn't have any understanding about what I am sing about. Now look back, it's already 10 years. Not as long as our brother John Nelson Darby, still I could say, "Lord, I still love You".</article>

    <article author="Earl Jan Lim" city="Cagayan de Oro City" provst="Misamis Oriental" country="Philippines" month="5" day="5" year="2009">We just came back from Taiwan to blend with the local saints there and they keep singing this song in mandarin, and it really touched me how one we are in Christ and how much care we have for one another. Being nothing and seeing nothing, but only living Christ in glory and His interest here on earth! Amen.</article>
    <article author="Samuel Chiu" city="Zamboanga City" provst="" country="Philippines" month="3" day="20" year="2009">This is just short song... But such a song can remind us how can we be a Normal Christians... "having NOTHING, being NOTHING, seeing NOTHING, and careful for NOTHING" but only Christ in GLORY!!!</article>
    <article author="Rumza Shirkey" city="Norman" provst="OK" country="United States" month="8" day="11" year="2008">I remember the first time I saw this song framed in one of the saints' home. I did not know that it was an actual song but I was very much taken by it. It just seemed to fit with the saints and the spirit that they lived by. Especially the first home meeting of the of the home of those saints that we visited. I thought -  that it was very becoming that they would have a plaque like this in their home. I felt so welcomed in their home and so invited. God the Spirit was very much alive in that place. And I think it was because they had become nothing so He can become everything. As if they themselves were nothing but Christ was everything. Praise the Lord and what a joy and privilege it is that we can become nothing that He may become everything!</article>
    <article author="Joey Ting" city="Kuala Lumpur" provst="" country="Malaysia" month="8" day="4" year="2008">We were singing this song last night during a group photo with the campus students from Taiwan (Tai Chung). It was quite a squeeze because of the number of people needed to fit into such a tight space. Anyway, I ended  up having a Taiwanese brother's right arm wrapping around me from behind and resting on my shoulders.

It was strange because I have never been comfortable with strangers, but I was actually overcome by how at ease I was with this brother who was about my age and whom I've never met, knew or even talked to. There's this indescribable yet tangible strangeness of familiarity between us, like we haven't met before but we actually knew each other for decades. I just appreciate how a friendly gesture like this brother's can actually make me feel accepted. I just like to remember this brother, or even whole blending experience with the saints from Taiwan with this song. 

May the Lord bless this experience. May this experience usher me into a new dimension of the reality of the Body of Christ.</article>
    <article author="ruby" city="" provst="" country="India" month="7" day="7" year="2008">Every time I sing this song it touches me deeply that I need to have this kind of consecration to such an extent where you don't want to  have anything, be anything, see anything but to care for our dear Lord's interest who is actually our living hope. It shatters my desires and ambitions to be something. What a realization our dear brother has had. I believe that this will not be our prayer but also our life. Lord, may we see You, possess You and be those who really care for You.</article>
