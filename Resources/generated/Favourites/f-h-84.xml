The word "Sun" is meant to convey the healing power of Christ in His shining as the light of life John 8:12 and the life that is the light of men John 1:4</article>

	<article author="Stephen Coker" email="slipsc1@hotmail.com" city="Jalal-Abad" provst="Jalalabad" country="Kyrgyzstan" month="3" day="5" year="2014">I believe there is a fifth verse originally: with the fourth verse which most modern versions leave out, to together they are:
Come, Desire of nations, come,|Fix in us thy humble home;|Rise, the woman’s conquering seed,|Bruise in us the serpent’s head.|Now display thy saving power,|Ruined nature now restore;|Now in mystic union join|Thine to ours, and ours to thine.
Adam’s likeness, Lord, efface;|Stamp Thy image in its place.|Second Adam from above,|Reinstate us in thy love.|Let us Thee, though lost, regain,|Thee, the life, the inner Man:|O! to all thyself impart,|Form’d in each believing heart.
(Hallelujah! Lord fix in us Your Humble Home)</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="Mi" country="United States" month="12" day="22" year="2013">In the 1857 version, the 1st 2 lines of the hymn are used as the chorus rather than repeating the last 2 lines of each stanza.
------------------------
In stanza 2, line 4, some versions of the hymn improve "a virgin" to "the virgin" to agree with the definite article which is there in the Hebrew in Isa 7:14 and in the Greek in Matt 1:23.
-----------------------
In the last stanza, 3rd line, the original said:
Second Adam from above,
The Hymnal.net version, "Final Adam", is a nice improvement to agree with 1 Cor 15:45.</article>

	<article author="Syd" email="stunkarella@yahoo.com" city="Pollock" provst="Louisiana" country="United States" month="12" day="30" year="2012">I love this site. It's helpful and very useful. I'm not very old so I don't exactly know the words, I only know the first verse, but yes I like it I would give it a 5/5 stars. I was making a present for my little brother (he's 5) and he's obsessed with angels so I drew him a picture and wrote the song on the back Hark... you know, well I hope he likes it and thank you who ever made this site and this was my first choice on Google and I liked it a lot so I think first time users like me should really use it a lot so I'm thankful there are still religious people in the world based on what it's like today, so thanks for making the site and letting people use it. It was a blessing. I know I might have spelled a word wrong or two it's probably because I'm not even a teenager. Bye!</article>
	<article author="Pcvh" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="10" day="12" year="2010">Excellent hymn! Praise the Lord for Jesus was born to raise the sons of earth and bring peace. Born to us the second birth, God and we the sinners being reconciled. By believing and receiving Jesus we experience regeneration. And now we are reinstated and being reconditioned and enjoying our 2nd birth. Hallelujah!
note: This hymn is a kind of regeneration song but not dedicated for Christmas because in the first place no record that Jesus was born on December 25 and much more no record in the Bible of "Christmas celebration".</article>
	<article author="Isaiah Tor" email="" city="Sydney" provst="NSW" country="Australia" month="8" day="25" year="2008">This exultant hymn concerns Christ in His statuses as the incarnate Immanuel. The Lord Jesus' incarnation is heralded as being that of the "everlasting Lord", with the joy of the heavenlies accompanying His birth by a virgin. The goal of Christ's birth this hymn retells, concerns not only the Lord's incarnation to become a aan mingled with God, but also that He as God become a man, may by His full salvation, make us man becoming God (but not in the Godhead) as His many brothers commencing from our "second birth" in regeneration, proceeding with Him in transformation and conformation, making His "humble home" in us! Thence at the culmination of this Immanuel's all-inclusive work as the incarnate Christ who passed through human living, death and resurrection to become the Spirit to make home in us, and bruise in us Satan's head (the self with the flesh is Satan incarnate) that we in our saved, uplifted, regenerated humanity mingled with this Immanuel may be reinstated in love to become God's full glory as the New Jerusalem according to God's original intent. Hallelujah!</article>
	<article author="Jason" email="" city="Anaheim" provst="CA" country="U.S.A." month="2" day="12" year="2007">"Pleased as man with man to dwell" is a great encouragement for one practicing the God-man living every day. When frustrated by those dwelling with us, we can be cheered and cherished by His own experience in humanity.

"Rise the woman's conqu'ring seed, Bruise in us the serpent's head;" What an aspiration and prayer in applying the prophetic word, so as to appropriate this promise daily, and enjoy once again what the Lord had accomplished on the cross two thousand years ago!</article>

	<article author="Filip S. Syrek" email="" city="Reading" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="11" day="11" year="2002">This hymn was written by Charles Wesley as one of over 5000 (!) hymns but certainly this one is the highest out of those thousands. I love my hymn book, I love to delve into the riches which are hidden in the hymns, to pray over and analyse them... There is a number of hymns which are just outstanding in relation to the truth they convey. Always when I come across one of them and get into it with the vision of the high peak of the divine revelation I can't help but go crazy in my spirit. This is the case with the hymn "Hark! The herald angels sing," - it is one of the top, top hymns in this outstanding collection. It touches the core of God's New Testament economy with the high peak notions. It describes the Triune God's incarnation, the coming of the mighty King who chose to become a man, pleased as man with man to dwell, Jesus our Immanuel. He was born that man no more may die! He was born to raise the sons of earth, born to give them second birth. It touches the matter of the real, true sonship of the believers, it speaks about our transformation with His divine element by making His home in our hearts, by crushing Satan's head inside of us, by dealing with our old Adamic nature, by sealing us with the Spirit in order that we may be transformed into His own image! Finally, to reinstate, to re-make, re-constitute us with the very essence of the Divine Trinity which is love. What a vision! What an insight! What a hymn! What a treasure!</article>
	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="12" day="20" year="2010">...Stanza 2 of Hymns, #84 says, "Christ, by highest heav'n adored, / Christ, the everlasting Lord: / Late in time behold Him come, / Offspring of a virgin's womb. / Veiled in flesh the Godhead see, / Hail th' incarnate Deity! / Pleased as man with man to dwell, / Jesus our Immanuel." Immanuel in Hebrew means "God with us." God became a man to live with man. Stanza 3 says, "Hail the heav'n-born Prince of Peace! / Hail the Sun of righteousness! / Light and life to all He brings, / Ris'n with healing in His wings: / Mild He lays His glory by, / Born that man no more may die; / Born to raise the sons of earth; / Born to give them second birth." This shows that God became a man in order to bring salvation to man.

God speaks and communicates to man through the Bible, but He also wants to be with man. Because He has given us the Bible, God does not need to speak directly to every believer, and if we pay attention to the words in the Bible, we can hear God's speaking. Nevertheless, even though God communicates through the words in the Bible, He personally came to be among man. However, He did not come in the greatness and glory of His position as the God who dwells in unapproachable light (1 Tim. 6:16). If He came in this way, no one would dare come near to Him. There is no way for us to approach the glorious light of God's holiness, because we are defiled and evil. As filthy sinners, we cannot see God, much less approach Him. Therefore, God became a man like us in order to come to us.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="25" year="2008">Today the Lord Jesus is in our spirit as the seed of the woman to bruise the head of the serpent. He bruised the head of the serpent on the cross, and today He is bruising the serpent's head in us. "Hark! the Herald Angels Sing" is a famous hymn written by Charles Wesley. The last verse of this hymn says, "Come, Desire of nations, come! / Fix in us Thy humble home: / Rise, the woman's conqu'ring seed, / Bruise in us the serpent's head; / Adam's likeness now efface, / Stamp Thine image in its place: / Final Adam from above, / Reinstate us in Thy love" (Hymns, #84). Christ's bruising of the serpent's head not only took place on the cross objectively but also is being accomplished in us subjectively. Without Satan's subtle activities in the garden, Christ could not have been revealed as the woman's conquering seed to bruise the head of the serpent in us.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="24" year="2008">Charles Wesley's hymn "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing" (Hymns, #84) is of a very high standard. I would like to point out stanza 3 of this hymn, which says, "Born to raise the sons of earth;/Born to give them second birth." God's economy needs man to go through two births. He receives a human life in his first birth. Then he has to go through another birth, the second birth. This birth is for him to receive the divine life. God intended that man would have two lives—the human life and the divine life. In order to do this, God must have a prototype, a model. So He Himself became incarnated to be the prototype.
...
Titus 3:5 speaks of the washing of regeneration. Regeneration is a washing. It washes away the filthiness of the old nature of our old man. This washing away is to put off our old man and put on the new man. It is also a kind of reconditioning. We all have been regenerated, reconditioned, with the divine life. Regeneration is very deep. I like this word recondition. Charles Wesley used the word reinstate in stanza 4 of hymn #84 —"Reinstate us in Thy love." We lost our state, our position, so we needed to be reinstated. But we also needed to be reconditioned. Our nature, our essence, and our entire being needed to be reconditioned. Nothing can do this except regeneration. To be regenerated is to be reborn, reconditioned, with the divine life.
