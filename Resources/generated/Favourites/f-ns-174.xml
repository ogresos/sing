It remind me over and over of the battle that took place on the cross at that very moment. It also remind me that I have enter into this battle too. We have a Captain in front of us, that cannot, nor will be defeated. Even though this enemy is fighting fearlessly, we won't be defeated, Praise The Lord Jesus our Captain.</article>
