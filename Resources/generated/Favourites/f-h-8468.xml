My hope is not success.

	<article author="hymnal.net" city="" provst="" country="" month="5" day="24" year="2016">Matthew 7:21-23 says, "Not everyone who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens. Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, was it not in Your name that we prophesied, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name did many works of power? And then I will declare to them: I never knew you. Depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness." We need to be assured that what we have done is not lawlessness but the will of the Father.
That day in verse 22 refers to the day of the judgment seat of Christ. When Watchman Nee was excommunicated by some of the co-workers in the early years of his ministry, he wrote a hymn that says, "Unto the judgment seat of Christ / I daily look away; / May all my living and my work / Abide the fire in that day." Only the living and work that are Christ can withstand the fire. We should seriously consider whether or not the Lord will approve our living and work at His judgment seat.
