	<article author="Frank Pytel" email="" city="Chicago" provst="Illinois" country="United States" month="2" day="7" year="2012">The word "touch" is a very inspiring word to me in the N.T. and in my time with the One I love. In the Gospel sometimes it is the seeking ones "touching" Jesus, and at other times it is Him "touching" them. He would "touch" individuals and even groups of needy ones were laid before Him to be "touched" by Him. John in His epistle says that they not only heard and saw Him but also handled Him. It is a daily mutual "touching" that keeps me going.</article>

	<article author="Helen Breen" email="" city="Nottingham" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="9" day="20" year="2009">Yes and the woman with the flow of blood said within herself, 'if only I touch Him I will be healed'. What a lovely morning revival song.</article>
	<article author="Nathan" email="" city="Long Beach" provst="CA" country="United States" month="7" day="23" year="2009">This reminds me of the time when the woman with the flow of blood came to the Lord while the crowd was pressing upon Him. The only way to be healed is to touch Him in faith. Lord Jesus, by faith we touch Thee. You are the source of every good!
"The pressing crowd received nothing from the Savior, but the woman who touched Him was healed." -Life-study of Mark, Witness Lee</article>
