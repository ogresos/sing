Instead of complaining, we need to be provoked in our spirit as is this hymn's prayer when we see so many young lives being misled. 
I had been praying for people until it became painful, and then I would stop. As stanza 3 says, I need to continue praying until prayer is turned to joy and praise. A sister shared P.U.S.H. - Pray Until Something Happens.

This wonderful hymn is so needed by the church today, but it is hardly known among Christians. I cannot tell for sure whether the author "Mrs. Albert Head" is Albert Head's 1st wife, Caroline (1852-1904), or his 2nd wife, Bessie Porter Head (1850-1936), whom he married in 1907. I think it was his first wife, since she was known as "Mrs. Albert Head", while his 2nd wife was known as "Bessie Porter Head"
This is from an article about the 1st Mrs. Head's untimely passing away in "Railway Signal: Or, Lights Along the Line" vols 22-23, 1904. 
"Christian workers in every part of the world, and belonging to every section of Christ's Church, knew they had a place in Mrs. Head's sympathy and prayers. ... Her big heart found room for every genuine effort for the salvation of souls, both in this and other lands. .... While still a school-girl she was known to declare herself the happiest person in the world, and this indeed was true to the end. There was ever a restfulness about her which spoke of deep heart trust in God, and the service of Him whom she so truly loved. …
She came of that notable Quaker stock which has furnished England with some of the brightest examples of Christian living in the past. [Her parents left the Quakers about 1863, when Caroline was 13. Her grandparents were both Quaker ministers. Mrs. Head used to say, 'What do we not owe ... to our beloved parents and grandparents' upbringing among the Friends?'] Her grandmother attained the great age of 109 years. …
The delicacy of her elder son rendered it necessary to spend 2 winters abroad, and finally to make their temporary residence in St. Leonards, where they were called upon to pass through severe trial in the loss of this dear boy at the age of 15, ... leaving the bereaved parents with but one son. ...
With large-hearted, generous love for every one who loved the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity, Mrs. Head threw open her house to receive all comers, those from 'the ends of the earth' being specially welcome, whether independent workers or missionaries in connection with any of the known societies. 
Probably she was most widely known in connection with the Keswick Convention where for many years without intermission she has promoted the facilities for missionaries at home on furlough to attend this gathering so abundantly owned by God. She felt that here was truth set forth in such a way as to lead her brothers and sisters into fuller blessing, thus enabling them to carry the Gospel in the power of the Spirit to the heathen in a way which perhaps they had never done before. ... Though much labor was entailed year by year, in seeking lodgings and planning for increasing numbers (on the last occasion more than 20 houses were thus organized), the service was taken with such gladness that one could but look on in wonder. ... There seemed to be no lack, for she was ever 'drawing water out of the wells of salvation.' ... Truly she was a hostess whose warm sympathy and catholicity [including everyone] put everyone at their ease. ...
Correspondence with many quarters of the globe was maintained by means of a circular letter, written at short intervals. She thus endeavored to strengthen the hands of scattered workers by helping them to realize the sympathy felt for them in the homeland. It was a loving, personal touch, which will be greatly missed by very many.”</article>
