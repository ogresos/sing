	<article author="Jonathan" email="" city="Tacoma" provst="WA" country="U.S.A." month="6" day="10" year="2006">Praise the Lord for His eternal purpose, His economy!  He's dispensing Himself in Christ, through the Spirit as Life into us to be a great corporate vessel filled with God alone as its content!  When this is expressed on the earth, this will issue in the Kingdom, which eventually, after a 1000 year reign of Christ and His redeemed and transformed people, will consummate in the New Jerusalem!  Thank you Lord Jesus for this, God's eternal purpose!</article>
