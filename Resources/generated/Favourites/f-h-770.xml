I chose it because it speaks of the holiest place - which today is in our spirit! This is where I want to be - in my spirit - the holiest place, because His Spirit is there with me.</article>
  <article author="Ivy Zhong" city="Beijing" country="China" month="12" day="18" year="2008">The third stanza says, %u201CTo the spirit turn, and the incense burn, touch the living fountain of life.%u201D Hallelujah! This living fountain proceeds out of the throne and come into us and springs up into eternal life! (John 4:14) Praise the Lord that we have a flowing God, and we%u2019re in this flow!</article>
    <article author="Hymnal.Net" month="3" day="24" year="2008">The first stanza of Hymn #770 says, "In the holiest place, touch the throne of grace, / Grace as a river shall flow." This is what Revelation 22:1 says: There is "a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street." That throne of God is the throne of grace. Whenever we come to the throne of grace, the grace of God is like a river flowing to us.
