He knows before we ask, He knows what we need, we need to trust Him. I am thankful I can throw my anxieties, my whole life onto Him. He loves us wholly, completely. We have a friend that sticks closer than a brother! Thank You Jesus for the cross.</article>

This tells us how to live in God's kingdom, always full of JOY. Not being anxious about anything. The song tells us how blessed we are for having a loving Father who knows and provides all our needs, even before we ask.  Praise the Lord, we don't just have the gift, much more we have the GIVER. We just need to trust HIM our future. HE IS OUR FUTURE. HE IS ALL OUR NEED AND MORE.</article>
