He allows us to participate in His very own Life so that our insignificant dreams be drowned in His All-Inclusive Dream! Our Beloved Lord wants us to be incorporated into His very own Life and in this mingled-Life, Divinity is expressed in our humanity. May the Lord have mercy on us; and may He transfigure our lowly existence and exchange it into an exhibition of all His Divine riches and glory! May this vision of Oneness and mingled Life absolutely change the way how we live our present life! Oh Lord, express Your life in me! Oh Lord, may we sustain Thy dream and Thy vision! Oh Lord, may Your dream capture and totally transform our own earthly existence and may we live the Life in the Heavenlies with You. We love you for making us part of Thy Divine Dream and incorporating us into Thy very own self! Oh how we need You to capture our hearts, moment by moment, so that we will never forget this Wonderful Dream of Oneness with Thee! Amen!</article>
