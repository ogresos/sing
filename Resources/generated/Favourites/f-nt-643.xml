By looking to Jesus, like Him thou shalt be; your friends, in your conduct, His likeness shall see."
Recently I've really been touched by the matter of spending time with the Lord. From our local winter retreat, I saw that I must redeem the time, and to redeem my time is to spend time loving Him. Nothing else compares to Him - there is no one else like our dear Lord Jesus. So shouldn't I be spending the most time loving Him, enjoying and conversing with the Lord? I love Him, I've consecrated my college life to Him, so why aren't I giving Him my full attention, my all? It is because I fail, constantly. And often times after I rebelled, I felt so unworthy and disheartened that I run away from Him. But Hallelujah, we can turn back to Him by choosing our spirit at ANY time! Whenever we fail, it's just another opportunity for me to turn back to Him. We need to PAY THE PRICE to take a stand to our soul life, but in the whole New testament we are never told to REPAY anything. The Lord just wants me to love Him, that I'd willingly pay the price to give my time and life to Him. I love You Lord!</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="12" day="1" year="2014">William Longstaff was a businessman, and the son of a wealthy English ship owner. He was his church's treasurer.
In June, 1873, D.L. Moody and Ira Sankey came to England to hold evangelistic meetings. They arrived broke, and were hoping their sponsors would have things ready for them, but instead the fellow they counted on had died, and nothing had been done to prepare for the evangelistic teamâ€™s arrival. Moody and Sankey scrounged around desperately to have a meeting and had a very meager group of about 50 that showed up. Soon afterwards, William Longstaff used his financial resources and influence to support them, and the small gatherings increased to 20,000 people in London, and was able to go on to Scotland.
He was also good friends with William Booth, founder of the Salvation Army. - extracted from hymnary and gbod
Longstaff heard a sermon on the text, "Be ye holy for I am holy" and wrote down what holiness meant to him. A businessman at heart, Longstaff wrote no flowery or pious-sounding verses but these down-to-earth thoughts.
The hymn appeared in a Christian newspaper in 1882 and was promptly forgotten. But years later gospel composer George Stebbins, who was leading music in India in connection with evangelistic services there, remembered the poem when he was asked if there was a good hymn on living a holy life. Retrieving the newspaper clipping he had saved, he set the poem to music - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton

thou soon shalt be fitted 
for service above.</article>

	<article author="Cicy Zhao" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="12" day="16" year="2006">The forth stanza is my favourite, because everytime I am getting mad, there is always a song singing in the deepest place in my heart to tell me that "take time to behold Him, be calm in thy soul, each thought and each temper, beneath His control", just by thinking and giving everything to the Lord, I always can keep calm. For each time I sing this song to myself, I know that my whole being is occupied by Him and beneath His control!!!! Praise the Lord!!! and also, this hymn encourages me to spend more personal time with Jesus, so that I can be more perfected and filled with the Holy Spirit!!!!</article>
	<article author="Clayton Wright" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="8" year="2006">I love this song. It is a reminder that I need to make time, to take time to enjoy the Lord. I pray that we can all have the time afforded to us by the Lord himself to come to Him, to just call on Him and enjoy Him. Oh, what a rescue to just come to Him and call! This has been my experience since this past weekend. I enjoyed the Lord at a college-age conference in Fort Yargo, GA. It was so wonderful to take the time to behold Him, to not have to worry about work or school the whole time.</article>
	<article author="Denil A." email="" city="" provst="" country="Malaysia" month="2" day="7" year="2006">Just before the Lord's coming back we all must give our time and lives presented unto Him. we have to take time to behold to our Lover, Christ. enjoying Him to the uttermost. pray for each locality around the world, so that everyone of us can bring back the Lord.
