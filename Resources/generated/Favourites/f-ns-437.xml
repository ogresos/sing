Lord, You’re living right inside of me.
And I see, Lord You are for me...
You loved me before time ever began.
And I see You really love me...
You’re the One who loves me as Your sheep.
And I see, Lord, You shepherd me...
You’re the only One who I will pursue.
’Cause I see, Lord, You are lovely.
t’s because Your being captivates me.
And I see I’m in love with You...
There is nothing else on earth for me.
And I see, Lord, You are my goal...
Lord now I see... i'm just meant for Your economy... nothing can ever satisfy me than You do... may I see and treasure You more...
