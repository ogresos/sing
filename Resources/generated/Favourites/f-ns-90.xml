I think this is correct even though all Protestant gospel harmonies that I have found seem to be sure that Luke 7 is a different event than the one in John 12, Matt 26 and Mk 14. (Catholics say that Luke 7 is the same event as in the other 3 gospels, but Mary the sister of Lazarus, who did this deed, is not the same person as Mary Magdalene (Jn 11:1-2,19; 19:25; 20:1).)

I think any reader of the Bible would get the feeling that all 4 accounts are the same event, but readers of commentaries will think Luke is a different event. 

Here are the similarities between Luke 7 and the other 3:
1. alabaster flask of ointment (Lk 7:37; Mt 26:7; Mk 14:3)
2. she anointed the Lord's feet (Lk 7:38; Jn 12:3)
3. She wiped the Lord's feet with her hair (Lk 7:38; Jn 12:3).
4. It was in the house of someone named Simon (Lk 7:36, 39-40; Mat 26:6; Mk 14:3)
5. The Lord says that this deed was so great that it will be spoken of for a memorial of her wherever the gospel is preached (Mt 26:13; Mk 12:9). This implies the deed was unique.

The "insurmountable" differences between Lk and the others:
1. Luke's seems to be in Galillee and the others in Bethany, but Luke does not say it is in Galillee. 
2. Luke's seems to have occurred much earlier, but Luke does not have connecting words to indicate it happened in sequence with the preceeding or following events in Luke. For example, Luke gives the Lord's 3 temptations in the wilderness in a different order than Matthew. Matt includes the connecting words so you know that they are in chronological order. Luke does not include connecting words there. Luke put them in order of our experience.

I post this long comment because I fear some conscientious, knowledgeable brothers (like me) may reject this very good song because they think it is wrong according to truth. That would be a loss.</article>
