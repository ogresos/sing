    <article author="Roman" email="" city="St. Petersburg" provst="" country="Russia" month="3" day="19" year="2011">Brother Hudson Taylor once told a devastating news about his coworkers. So on learning the news he started singing this hymn. When asked by a brother who was with him at the moment why he wouldn't mourn or do something of this kind about the situation, he replied: Would that help them right now? His point was that we need to get strengthened in our inner man in whatever situation the Lord has arrange and help others to touch them. We need to make our soul happy on our God... I may not be correct in presenting all the details. Sorry about that. The general story I heard from the brothers.</article>
