	<article author="Rebekah Edwards" email="reb_67ed@yahoo.com" city="Cameron" provst="OK" country="United States" month="8" day="12" year="2016">It's been so very long since I heard this. I looked it up after reading out of the book "Hymns for a kid's heart" by Bobbie Wolgemuth and Joni Eareckson Tada Volume One—it is a very special book! And he who comes to God must come as a little child! In Mark 10:15 Jesus said "Assuredly, I say to you,whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will by no means enter it"! This is an extremely powerful song with beautiful music based on Psalm 23! Blessings to all my brothers and sisters in Christ! Look up for He is coming again!!!</article>
	<article author="Leslie Fitzpatrick" email="lesliefitzpatrick@verizon.net" city="UpperDarby" provst="PA" country="United States" month="6" day="30" year="2016">I was told in Bible study that the Hebrew word translated as "follow" in the last stanza is more accurately rendered "pursue". I love the idea of our Good Shepherd pursuing us, actively chasing after us because He loves us, using His rod and staff—His goodness and mercy—to protect and guide His straying sheep to His house to dwell with Him forever.</article>

Having lost my dear Dad at age nine, only to have a mother, Elder Mrs Arit Ikon Akpabio, becoming the only father I know from then, life was tough but Jehovah manifested in our family.

I guess it's my favorite hymn. It comforts the child of God, and reassures them of God's love and care for them. If you are not born again, get born again (Acts 16:31, Romans 10:9-10) and keep this hymn as your daily anthem.</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="1" day="5" year="2014">Scottish Bibles in the 17th century often had psalms in meter printed after the book of Revelation. The metrical psalms were sung twice a day in most of the humble cottages of Scotland and so became more familiar to the people than the Bible text itself.
This text of the familiar 23rd Psalm comes from a metrical version by Francis Rous, a member of the British Parliament. He was dissatisfied with the accuracy of other psalm translations being used by the Puritans, some of which took liberties with the meaning to make the words rhyme. As you can see, this version is a faithful paraphrase of David's original. Rous's Psalter was widely used and was authorized by the Westminster Assembly, which also created the Westminster Confession of Faith. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>
