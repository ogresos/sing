Praise the Lord we are His MASTERPIECE!! This shows that God is not looking for one individual expression, but a corporate expression! Saints, we cannot go on in the church life by ourselves. We all need companions to pursue the Lord with. I live, if you stand firm in the Lord; you live, if I stand firm in the Lord!
Lord, do companionize us!</article>

	<article author="A Sister :)" email="" city="Manila" provst="" country="Philippines" month="6" day="30" year="2011">I enjoyed this hymn because there was a time I almost backslid, but because of a certain sister that I'm shepherding, because of her going on, I was helped to go back to the Lord.

Our going on is really for the other saints. Don't think that your Christ is small, because that certain sister that had encouraged me is actually just new in the church life, but her going on has really encouraged and helped me. =)</article>

	<article author="Arnel Marcial" email="" city="Dubai" provst="United Arab Emirates" country="United Arab Emirates" month="1" day="6" year="2010">I want to encourage you all, without your supply I would fall. Never think that your Christ is so small. Christ needs you, and so we do all. We need each member of the Body. How wonderful that God has placed me in the Body which is the church today. The church life is the place to stay and there's no other home for me.</article>
	<article author="B Liu" email="" city="Toronto" provst="Ontario" country="Canada" month="11" day="13" year="2009">“But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, even as He willed”.

Praise the Lord! We are “individually members one of another”. Each member is organically joined to all the others, and each needs the function of all the others. No member can live apart from the Body. 

God is not after a group of spiritual and sinless people. Rather, He is after a Body. Only our being in the Body will have eternal value in the eyes of God.

Christ needs you, and so do we all.</article>

How precious His Body, praise the Lord He has put us in the Body and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against the builded church!! Praise the Lord Satan trembles in the Body!! Praise the Lord we are in the Body now, and may the Lord keep us safe in His ark! Jesus is Lord!!</article>
