We need to have a deep realization that God has given us a commission that is higher than that of angels and heavenly hosts which is to preach the gospel of Jesus as the Christ! as such, we need to be constituted by Christ as the Living Word. In the book of Acts some men who want to cast out demons to gain glory said " I adjure you by the Christ whom Paul preaches." but the demon said "Jesus I know of, and Paul I am acquainted, but who are you?" and immediately the demon also possessed the man who is casting the demon out. the demon didn't recognize the authority of the selfish men for they are not of Christ. today, we need to see that when preaching the gospel or casting out demons, we first need to be in our spirit and be constituted with the Word :)</article>
