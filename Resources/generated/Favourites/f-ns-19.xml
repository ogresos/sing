	<article author="Anonymous" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="6" day="7" year="2016">Why are we so frightened of walking in Jesus' footsteps?? Watchman Nee did it to show us how it's done. Western civilization has made us too complacent. This hymn should be our prayer to be more like Jesus.</article>
	<article author="Jasper" email="zion62@naver.com" city="" provst="" country="South Korea" month="5" day="27" year="2016">This hymn precisely portrays the meaning of living a sacrificing life in the Body although it is just short.
'Pour my life out that others be blessed/ be in suffering that they be contented/ And let my life for others' joy be spent.'
Watchman Nee is definitely a good pattern of living a sacrificing life in the Body as a slave of the Lord to minister life to the Body.</article>
	<article author="IrisCrystal" email="ic.yi@yahoo.com" city="" provst="" country="South Korea" month="3" day="31" year="2015">I would like to address thanks to brother Steve Miller for his posting and sharing on this page another well-known version of this hymn; I have the vocal version of that very lyric brother Steve Miller posted, and it was sung by some of our dear brothers who are, no doubt, not the professional singers, yet could be recognized as the believers to know of how to offer praise before the Lord from own spiritual experiences accompanied by some mysterious transactions between own being and the Lord Himself in each one's life. I am sorry about not being able to share with others that very vocal version on this web page, which I’ve appreciated so far as a sort of glance into 'the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth' (1Cor. 5:8). 
And with the relation to the comment of sister Nancy Northrup from USA in fellowship, I’d like to share my view that in Biblical sense and based on the implication of the lyric, the English lyric translated into “Let me break bread, while I keep not” is more correct and appropriate than the rendering of “Let me break bread, while I eat not”, because this phrase “Let me pour wine, while I drink not, Let me break bread, while I keep not” conveys the implication of drink offering and one meal offering respectively in view, I think. 
In order for our being to be poured out as a drink offering (2Tim.4:6), we will need to have some practical spiritual experiences and lessons from the Lord who had been presented as ‘grape which beyond self-centered selfish concern had been dealt with for the process of its being oppressed in order to be transformed into ‘wine to make God and people cheer and happy’ (Judges 9:13). Likewise, in order for us to be participated in one and only meal offering on the Lord’s table, we ourselves will need to have some experiential reality of the Lord who had been presented as one offering(Heb.10:14) as one Body (Heb.10:5), which requires our being to be terminated in its natural disposition and inclination and so on, and then to be blended with other members that are many grains produced from one grain (John12:24); in that very process of our being dealt with for blending, what is needed is our cooperation with His work on each one of us in the matter of each one’s being broken, not keeping and reserving own self so that each one of us may be blended with other members to be one and only meal offering to God as one Body of Christ. In other words, before we can eat bread which we break in the fellowship of the Body(1Cor.10:16), we first should be able to identified as that very one Body, symbolized by the bread (1Cor.11:24), and for our being able to be identified as and participate in that very one Body, one meal offering, we as the grains (John 12:24) should be broken and grounded into fine flour and then should be blended together to form one loaf (1Cor.10;17) and to be broken again for others being fed, which cannot be accomplished as far as we try to keep ourselves preserved as a seemingly nice grain in our own attempt not to be broken and not to be grounded into a fine flour which is aimed to be a one and only meal offering to God. The underlining thought in the phrase of “Let me pour wine, while I drink not, Let me break bread, while I keep not” lies on the prerequisite of our following the pattern of the Lord, who loved us “to the uttermost”(John 13:1) so that we may love one another not in word nor in tongue but in deed and truthfulness, laying down our lives on behalf of the brothers (1 John 4:10-11, 3:16-19) as one Body (1Cor.17). 
And what we are always being touched from this lyric is the genuine inner condition and sentiment of God’s overcomer who had been pressing on the ordained way for him as a faithful pilgrim’s life, in the process of keeping the word of his testimony, not loving own soul-life even unto death(Rev.12:11). May the Lord lead us “having so great a cloud of witnesses”(Heb.12:1) including this lyric writer as our pattern, into the way for us to “stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving together along with the faith of the gospel”(Phil.1:27) in our “offering up a sacrifice of praise continually to God”(Heb.13:15) from the deepest part of our being.</article>

	<article author="Sister C" email="tveformwc@hotmail.com" city="DC Metro" provst="Maryland" country="United States" month="7" day="8" year="2014">I really appreciate the fellowship of the saints in the comments section. If not for these, I wouldn't have noticed the word "keep" so particularly. It's in both translations. It does sound strange at first. Why would brother Nee choose to say "keep" when he could just as well have said "eat?" In Matt. 26:26-29, the Lord broke bread and poured wine for the disciples, telling them that His blood was shed and His body was broken for them. The Lord Jesus as our perfect Pattern lived such a life, not caring for the drinking of earthly enjoyment. He willingly took the cup of suffering, that we might have the cup of blessing; He didn't care to "keep" (preserve) Himself, but to be fully broken, that we all might partake of and enjoy Him as the living bread which came down out of heaven. To take this Pattern - caring only to be utterly poured out and broken to supply others - was brother Nee's prayer. May it also be ours.</article>
	<article author="Nancy Northrup" email="nancy.northrup@gmail.com" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="7" day="5" year="2014">"Let me pour wine, while I drink not.
Let me break bread, while I keep not"
The first line contrasts pouring wine with not drinking. It seems to me that it would make more sense for the second line to contrast breaking bread with not eating, rather than not keeping. "Keep not" doesn't make sense there in English. Maybe it got "spell-checked."
So: Let me pour wine, while I drink not. Let me break bread, while I eat not.</article>

It's the matter of life! We're in the principle of right or wrong not in life. As long as my spirit touches life in this hymn and there's nothing wrong about the lyrics itself.</article>
	<article author="Zoe" email="zoelili@126.com" city="" provst="" country="China" month="9" day="24" year="2013">I have read this hymn when I was young, but not be touched so much until now.
"Learning You are my only solacement,
And let my life for others’ joy be spent."
We often expect to find solacement from many things or persons those are not The Lord Himself. May The Lord enlighten us that we can look unto Him alone and hope in Him alone. And we do not live to please ourselves but to please The Lord. Amen!</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="5" day="3" year="2013">An earlier translation of this hymn. As others have posted, and I agree, this is more excellently written:

Let me love and not be respected;
Let me serve and not be rewarded;
Let me labor and not be remembered;
Let me suffer and not be regarded.

'Tis the pouring, not the drinking;
'Tis the breaking, not the keeping -
A life suff'ring to seek others' blessing,
A life loving and true comfort giving.

Not expecting pity and concern,
Not accepting solace and applause;
Even lonely, even forgotten,
Even wordless, even forsaken.

Tears and blood my price for the righteous crown shall be;
Losing all, my cost for a faithful pilgrim's life,
'Twas the life, O Lord, that You chose to live
In those days when on earth You walked,
Gladly suff'ring all injuries and loss
So that all might draw near and repose.

I cannot see how much farther I shall go;
Still I press on, knowing there is no return.
Let me follow Your pattern so perfect and true,
Bearing ingratitudes without complaint.

In this time of trial, O my Lord, I pray
that You'd wipe all my hidden tears away;
Let me learn, O Lord, You are my reward,
Let me be others' blessing all my days.</article>

	<article author="Sis LC" email="" city="Auckland" provst="" country="New Zealand" month="1" day="11" year="2012">I enjoyed "On this path of no retreating I am led." After spending 6 months in the FTT, I went back to work for the break. Now I find that my colleague who was also my good friend since university now lives a completely different life to me. We could have chosen to live the wealthy life they do, but we have been gloriously wrecked! Even if we take that path we would not be happy. We want to live for the Lord's testimony. This is a path of no retreating. Once, by His mercy, we've been captured by this vision there is no retreating. We are no longer able to live in a vain way again. Praise the Lord.</article>

If all believers on the earth had this living, the unbelievers would see the glory of God: the love of God, expressed in the face of Jesus Christ, through multitudes of redeemed and transformed people who were one new man, Jesus, on the earth.

It speaks of the price we pay and the life we need to live to gain the crown. It is a constant reminder that the life we should live is not easy, but will be rewarded. I was wondering though why the lyrics were changed. I do think the song was more powerful with the other lyrics.</article>

	<article author="R.D." email="" city="Austin" provst="Texas" country="United States" month="8" day="31" year="2008">There is not another hymn that touches the core of my being bringing forth tears generated from my spirit. The scripture says "Deep calleth unto deep"- I believe this is the reason my spirit is always deeply moved by this hymn, that is, because the writer brother Watchman Nee wrote it out of his divine human sufferings.

For our Lord's return a second time we too must follow His pattern, having a mind to suffer.

May the Lord at this time have His overcomers who being filled to the brim with grace live a life fully in resurrection.

Praise the Lord for the economy of God!</article>
	<article author="Isaiah Tor" email="" city="Sydney" provst="NSW" country="Australia" month="8" day="4" year="2008">This hymn speaks of the depths of the crucified life to live out the Christ who has been processed in incarnation, human living, death and resurrection to become the Spirit as life to us in our spirit. It is not about being a "hero", it concerns particularly with the denial of the self according to the resurrection power of Christ in order that this Christ may be lived out by us. This hymn must be our daily experience, not in an ascetic spirit, but rather a matter of being continually one with Him, through the cross and by the Spirit, unto the reward of becoming utterly the same as He is in life, nature, function, expression, and constitution but not in the Godhead (Phil. 3:8-12).</article>
	<article author="rhea medellada" email="" city="Mandaue city" provst="cebu" country="Philippines" month="5" day="31" year="2008">i love this song because it reminds me that in my christian life i should not ask anything else  in  serving  the Lord, Just love Him. Even if there are trials that comes  in me, even people reject, even if many tears comes to me because of Him i should not be discourage. The loove of God will guide us. , "I CAN DO ALL THINGS IN HIM WHO IMPOWERS ME"</article>

	<article author="Edna Kanabahita" email="" city="Kampala" provst="" country="Uganda" month="8" day="24" year="2007">When I came across this song, I was going through some dealings with the Lord. The more I gave it all to the Lord, the more I was not respected, rewarded, remembered or even rewarded. The more it became lonely, and even stepped upon. But praise the Lord that twas this life, that our Lord chose to live. O may I learn that He is my reward so that I may be others' blessings all my days.</article>
	<article author="Jonathan" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="10" day="18" year="2006">As I sing this song my spirit really lifts me up and as I got in the middle of the song,my tears would fall. I just can feel how to really offer ourselves as living sacrifice to God. That even if we live a miserable life in serving Him,it is Him we gain and it is the most incredible thing that will happen,that is to live Christ and to die in order to gain Him. May the lord be gracious to us that we live the pattern set before us by our Lord Jesus. Oh Lord Jesus we really really love.</article>
	<article author="Cheu Kok Hoong" email="" city="Kuala Lumpur" provst="" country="Malaysia" month="9" day="18" year="2003">I must admit that before the Video Training on the Crystallization Studies of 2 Corinthians, my appreciation of this hymn is shallow, merely enjoying its beautiful tune and did not really see the depths of its lyrics. Now to me, this hymn reminds me of the patterns set before us- persons who are such marvelous examples of following the Lord until the end, not even sparing their soul-lives.

I would like to offer relevant Bible verses for your enjoyment and reflection:
"Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body. For we who are alive are always being delivered unto death for Jesus' sake that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh. So then death operates in us, but life in you." 2 Corinthians 4:10-12.

May the Lord has a way to constitute many who love Him and are willing to come up to God's standard as new covenant ministers!</article>
	<article author="Filip S. Syrek" email="" city="Reading" provst="Berkshire" country="United Kingdom" month="6" day="2" year="2003">There was a time in my life when I was so pleased to listen to this song mainly because of a beautiful tune... As the time went by I began to see the words... More time have passed and I started to realize the deep meaning of those lyrics. Yet another long period of time and I became thrilled by the reality of the experience of the one who resigns himself utterly for the Lord and His work. Sweetest of all is the realization that the Lord had given me the way to become such a one who loves Him and loves His coming... I want Him to take me one step further into complete obedience unto Him... For Him I give my all, for Him I CHOOSE to suffer all injuries and loss for the benefit of His saints... For Him I choose to live a life that seeks others' blessing, a life loving and TRUE comfort giving... And truly, He knows that I cannot see how much farther I shall go, but still I press on knowing THERE IS NO RETURN. I love Him! His pattern is so perfect and true! I don't care to be respected when I love! I refuse to accept pity and concern... Losing ALL, my cost for a faithful pilgrim's life... Even now in the time of trial, I bow down and pray that He would wipe all my hidden tears away... I just want to waste myself upon the most beautiful One! Waste myself without reservation! Without holding back! Take me Lord and make me others' blessing! I choose You, and I am open to You. Don't allow me to choose by myself but be one with You for Your purpose!

Let me learn, o Lord, YOU ARE MY REWARD! Take away everything that occupies my heart - even the sweetest love and deepest care if they are not for You and Your church, Your Bride! I am willing to pay the price - let me Lord! Let me be such a one! Just let me... I don't care for anything and no one else. In Your hand I place my future, save me in Your Love!</article>
	<article author="Zoe Cabahug" email="" city="Greensboro" provst="NC" country="U.S.A." month="1" day="26" year="2003">I like this song very much. It tells me to just consecrate all my life to the Lord. Wherever He will lead me I will follow. I want to just serve Him with all of my being. In all trials we must just turn to the Lord for His guidance. We will not need anything but Him; He is our everything. Lord, I hope that You will lead Your pattern for me to follow. Amen!</article>
