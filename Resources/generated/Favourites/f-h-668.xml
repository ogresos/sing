Fearing that it might be squandered, if suddenly bestowed upon him, the wise minister sent him but a little at a time, with a note, saying, This is thine; use it wisely; there is more to follow. Brethren, that’s just the way God deals with us. - D. L. Moody

The original song is a bit different:
1. Have you on the Lord believed?
Still there’s more to follow.
Of His grace have you received?
Still there’s more to follow.
Oh, the grace the Father shows!
Still there’s more to follow.
Freely He His grace bestows,
Still there’s more to follow.

In stanza 2, the original says "love" instead of "grace" in lines 5 &amp; 7.</article>
