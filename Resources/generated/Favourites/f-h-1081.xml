	<article author="Imelda D'Almeida" email="" city="London" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="12" day="5" year="2011">Thank You Lord for the processes (incarnation, human living, crucifixion and resurrection) You went through to bring this oneness. Thank You for Your prayer in John 17:21 -" That they all be one; even as You, Father are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us". As surely as the sanctifying Word, the sanctifying God, the sanctifying Spirit, and the sanctifying Life are One, those (the believers) who are being sanctified are also one. Praise the Lord!</article>
	<article author="Lucia Lu" email="" city="Atlanta" provst="GA" country="United States" month="12" day="9" year="2010">What a privilege that we can call Him 'Abba, Father!"

Jesus said to her (Mary), "Do not touch Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brothers, and say to them that I am ascending to My Father and your Father, My God and your God." (John 20:17).

"For both He who sanctifies and those who are
being sanctified are all of One, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers... (Hebrews 2:11). 

He who sanctifies is Christ as the Firstborn Son of God, and those who are being sanctified are the believers of Christ as the many sons of God. Both the firstborn Son and the many sons of God are born of the same Father God in resurrection and have the same divine life and nature. Hence, He is not ashamed to call them brothers." (Recover Version, p. 1037).</article>
	<article author="Jesus In Me" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="1" day="25" year="2010">Thank You Lord for He helps us flee away all kinds of traditions, natural thoughts, preference, doctrines and rituals. We no longer live in doctrines, but we live in the Triune God. God's word is supreme! We could be one in God's Word!</article>
	<article author="Doug" email="" city="Ashland" provst="MA" country="United States" month="9" day="18" year="2008">Thank You Lord and thank you saints. This sweet hymn has really helped me to draw closer to our dear Lord today, to enjoy Him more fully, and to be nourished tenderly by His  love and His Word. We rejoice in our corporate oneness with Him, the glorious expression of the Triune God!</article>
