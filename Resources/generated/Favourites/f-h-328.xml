	<article author="Alice Baker" email="alicedianebaker@gmail.com" city="Fullerton" provst="CA" country="United States" month="8" day="18" year="2016">This hymn that says so much was brought to mind while reading Oswald Chambers this morning. He was writing about self-consciousness. "It is never God's will that we should be anything less than complete in Him. Anything that disturbs rest in him must be cured at once and it is not cured by being a ignored, but by coming to Jesus Christ."
Or, as my friend Marguerite says, "Back to Jesus"</article>

I was sad when no one knew this beautiful old hymn when I mentioned it. I wanted them to have these words. I thought I would try the internet and there it was on your website!With music! Thank you! I have made copies and they will have the words this week.</article>
	<article author="Dick Valnes" email="" city="Eugene" provst="Oregon" country="United States" month="2" day="9" year="2010">It's a commentary on the book of Colossians, very much in line with the truths that are emphasized; so refreshing in contrast to all our emphasis on "man's response" in the music today.</article>
