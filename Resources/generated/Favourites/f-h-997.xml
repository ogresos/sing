	<article author="Mr Wayne Harropson" email="wayne@harropson.com" city="Fountain Valley" provst="CA" country="United States" month="3" day="13" year="2014">It is missing a couple of verses.

And now complete in Him
My robe His righteousness,
Close sheltered 'neath His side,
I am divinely blest.

When from my dying bed
My ransomed soul shall rise,
"Jesus died my soul to save,"
Shall rend the vaulted skies.</article>

I had not sung it since then, but the other day it brought revival to my heart. It was truly inspired by the writer... I am so thankful for it! You are never too old to receive a new anointing from The Lord!</article>

When other peoples' comments are posted, the additional lyrics will be out of sight unless one deliberately scrolls down. Would you add them to the main lyrics so everyone can see them, please? I am so blessed by this website!</article>

Title: might also be filed under "Jesus Paid It All" please.

Additional lyrics:

I hear the Savior say,
“Thy strength indeed is small;
Child of weakness, watch and pray,
Find in Me thine all in all.” 

Refrain:
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain,
He washed it white as snow.

For nothing good have I
Whereby Thy grace to claim;
I’ll wash my garments white
In the blood of Calv’ry’s Lamb.

And now complete in Him,
My robe, His righteousness,
Close sheltered ’neath His side,
I am divinely blest.

Lord, now indeed I find
Thy pow’r, and Thine alone,
Can change the leper’s spots
And melt the heart of stone.

When from my dying bed
My ransomed soul shall rise,
“Jesus died my soul to save,”
Shall rend the vaulted skies.

And when before the throne
I stand in Him complete,
I’ll lay my trophies down,
All down at Jesus’ feet.</article>
