	<article author="Broken Vessel" email="micklure@gmail.com" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="8" day="22" year="2016">I stumbled upon this, but speaks so accurately about how I want the Lord to restore me. I know I'm saved and secure in Christ. But there's a specific brokeness that only God can heal. I know someday, the Lord will reveal a new heaven and earth, where we won't be afflicted by a fallen nature. But I pray every day that He would choose to reach down in His compassion and "open" these "lips long dumb and silent". This hymn articulates my plea with precise intelligibility.</article>

Flow through us Lord! Till waters from Thy fountain, shall slake the thirst of souls in deserts drear. Flow through us Lord till arid places blossom! With roses fresh and sweet and wondrous fair!</article>

Oh how I praise Him for His sweet water of life, ever fresh and so abundant! 
Yes, flow through me, Lord, a weak and earthly vessel, 
cleansed by Thy blood, and quickened at Thy call!</article>
