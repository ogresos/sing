He was educated first under the Rev. J. M. Gould, and then at St. John's College, Cambridge. Subsequently he studied under Professor Nesbitt, at the Agricultural and Chemical College, Kennington. In 1853 he underwent a great spiritual change. Leaving the Church of England, he first joined the Methodist New Connexion body, and then the Congregationalists. After the usual theological training, he entered the ministry, and held several pastorates.
Mr Matson's hymns show a considerable mastery of the forms of hymnic expression, but are somewhat lacking in lyric energy. Those written for use with German chorales are excellent efforts, and rank with his best work. Taken as a whole his hymns are far above the average, and deserve wide acknowledgment. [Rev. W. Garrett Horder] - Dictionary of Hymnology by Julian

The original stanza 3, 1st and last lines, say:
O blessed life! the soul that soars,
...
Whose love unlocks the heavenly doors.</article>
