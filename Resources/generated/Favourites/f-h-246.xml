I just love to listen to it over and over and always listen to it in the morning before coming to work and when I closed from work. It took me almost 5 years searching for this particular album having the song because I only at first knew how to hum the songs without knowing the author. I had to contact some one from Douala who sells gospel cds to get it fron Nigeria for me. It's a master piece</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="5" day="21" year="2013">Manie Payne, born in Carlow, Ireland, was a Christian, but she did not know peace. She struggled with her sinful nature until she began to experience the fullness of the Holy Spirit. This is the "blessed quietness" that she wrote about. Once that occurred, she was so happy she could hardly contain herself. Indeed, joy was flowing like a river in her life.
Later she married T. P. Ferguson and founded Peniel Missions, with branches in Egypt, China, and the west coast of the United States. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>

	<article author="Adenike Odunuga" email="" city="Lagos" provst="" country="Nigeria" month="1" day="21" year="2007">This song is melodious and its beautiful rhymes and unique composition make me like it. It is to me a prohetic song which I sing when things get disquiet and rough. There is blessed quietness when the Spirit of God takes over, when we go into the presence of God and leave our troubles behind us. His words are peaceful.</article>
