	<article author="Margaret Kwamboka Nyambati" email="" city="Nairobi" provst="Nairobi" country="Kenya" month="1" day="2" year="2009">This song makes one (me) picture Christ's humble look and gentle voice pleading with one (me) to come to Him. It really is sad when the Lord calls us to leave evil ways and follow Him yet we say no. Say yes to Jesus today, please. Thanks and God bless.</article>
