	<article author="Abel Park" email="" city="Ningbo" provst="Zhejiang" country="China" month="1" day="7" year="2012">How sweet Your love it is!
What a deep and wide Your love it is!

Although, I call the name of the Jesus, and do pray-reading almost everyday. Although, I have been being with You a little long time.

Lord Jesus! Last year, I have losted myself in somewhere place. Frankly speaking, I have not known where I am.

I am so sorry, Lord Jesus, because I am a fallen man, so I have clearly forgotten Your precious love so many times.

Doing many things not touching Your love. Oh! Lord Jesus, I return to You from whole my being.

Lord Jesus! Really need You! Your love is more better that any other things on the earth.</article>

	<article author="Sis LC" email="" city="" provst="" country="New Zealand" month="12" day="6" year="2009">Verse 3 reminds us that we are sinners that touched the Lord. We are like the woman not worthy to anoint the Lord. But the Lord, knowing who we are, allowed us to touch Him and anoint Him! What a privilege to pour ourselves on Him! Our consecration is not a boast or some kind of extraordinary sacrifice. It is our reasonable reaction to His love toward us. Saints, we are so honored that we can give our all to Him!</article>
	<article author="Josh Huang" email="" city="Plano" provst="Texas" country="United States" month="11" day="10" year="2008">Every time I recall this testimony of Mary of Bethany, it touches me deeply.

Lord make me love You and treasure You more than anything else!</article>
