I've just finished preaching on this text just yesterday. Longing for the Lord to lift my soul from its deep and treacherous valley. Bless the Lord for the music and the stirring words. Thanks.</article>

Formerly the flame guarded and kept man away from the tree of life when man fell, but now, this very flame-fire (Spirit) is ONE with the thornbush-isn't this marvelous saints! Lord Jesus so we just need to FAN INTO FLAME this gift within us-2 Tim. 1:6-7. Lord thank You we are indeed so blessed to have a part in this corporate thornbush, may we express ths oneness of this flame daily by fanning our spirit into flame.</article>
