	<article author="Joanna L Smathers" email="fjsmathers@aol.com" city="Baton Rouge" provst="LA" country="" month="10" day="14" year="2015">This is the song for week 15, volume three of the crystallization of Exodus. It touched me deeply. Seems to me so applicable for the refugee situation in Europe right now. What a Grace and Mercy we could know the church in these days. Yes Lord in these days make us Your golden lampstand to bear before the nations Thy light that all behold.</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="8" day="11" year="2013">William Walsham How served a rural congregation on the Welsh border for 28 years and then ministered in London's East End. He loved children and wrote hymns for them. One of them began like this: "It is a thing most wonderful, almost too wonderful to be, that God's own Son should come from heaven, and die to save a child like me."
William How also loved the Bible. On his symbolic pastoral staff, he engraved the words of St. Bernard: "Pasce verbo, Pasce vita," which means "Feed with the Word, feed with the Life." - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>
