	<article author="Letesha Parker" email="leteshalinrp@gmail.com" city="Claremont" provst="NH" country="United States" month="6" day="22" year="2016">The Love of God covers and sustains all His believers. It is deeper, greater, and richer than we have words for. If you have touched upon the Love of God you will never ever be the same. The Love of God is so sweet tender and true. And never forget the Love of God covers a multitude of sins. As far as the east is from the west is how far our sin has been removed from us.</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="2" day="8" year="2014">Probably the most heartening letter I have received recently came from a young mother who lives behind the Iron Curtain. Her son is a voice student and wanted to sing gospel music, but they wrote me that none was available in their country. I sent a couple of records that got through. When the boy told his teacher that he wanted to sing gospel music, she didn't know what he meant. The mother wrote:
"Then, God gives to Eddie's mind to ask her if she has grammaphone, he will bring her some records that she can know which kind of songs he wish to learn. She knows English and German language. When she heard this records, she was so happy she was playing all day during nearly one month. They liked "The Love of God" so much they translated it and then are singing so loud that the windows was trembling. Can you imagine what great courage she has singing this Christians songs by opened window? Her house is on main street and everyone who passes hear the beautiful song. Eddie says she was jumping on her chair from happiness, playing piano and singing, telling: wonderful, wonderful."
I include these letter excerpts not because they reflect kindly on the singer, but that they testify again to the timeless power of gospel music and hymns to reach people and change lives. - George Beverly Shea in "Songs that Lift the Heart"</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="2" day="4" year="2014">Speaking of Frederick M. Lehman's great hymn "The Love of God" reminds me of something I learned about it not long ago. Rumor had it that the 3rd verse lyrics were found on the walls of a [mental] institution about the time this popular hymn was written in 1917. Though this could be true, the roots of it go back to the 11th century, at least, and maybe further. According to my information, a modern-day translation of the verse was made by Rabbi Joseph Marcus from the Aramaic. A close approximation of the verse is used one day each year in the Jewish observance of Shavuot (Festival of Weeks) [or Pentecost] which begins 7 weeks after Passover.
But without Mrs. Lehman there would be no song. Like Mother's habit of placing poems and notes on the piano for me, Frederick Lehman's wife put such findings in her husband's lunch pail. Mr. Lehman was a minister, but because most of his churches were small and could pay him little, he worked at various jobs to support his family. One of these jobs was in a cheese factory, and it was there that Mr. Lehman got his inspiration for "The Love of God." His wife had come into possession of a poem which began, "Could we with ink the ocean fill ... ." She put a copy of it in Frederick's lunch pail. He was so moved by the words that he came home that night and worked on a tune to go with them. Later, he wrote 2 other verses and thus was born another great gospel hymn.
Whatever the 3rd verse's origin it is good to know that Christians and Jews share in the sentiments expressed in these great words of praise to God. - George Beverly Shea in "Songs that Lift the Heart"</article>

The Love of God is far more than men can imagine or comprehend. He Loved us even while we were yet sinners.

	<article author="Bill Chellberg" email="" city="Wheaton" provst="IL" country="United States" month="12" day="23" year="2011">Here is the story of the writing of this hymn: Words: Frederick M. Lehman; he wrote this song in 1917 in Pasadena, California, and it was published in Songs That Are Different, Volume 2, 1919. The lyrics are based on the Jewish poem Haddamut, written in Aramaic in 1050 by Meir Ben Isaac Nehorai, a cantor in Worms, Germany; they have been translated into at least 18 languages.
One day, during short intervals of inattention to our work, we picked up a scrap of paper and, seated upon an empty lemon box pushed against the wall, with a stub pencil, added the (first) two stanzas and chorus of the song…Since the lines (3rd stanza from the Jewish poem) had been found penciled on the wall of a patient’s room in an insane asylum after he had been carried to his grave, the general opinion was that this inmate had written the epic in moments of sanity.</article>

	<article author="Janet Watkins" email="" city="Gainesville" provst="GA" country="United States" month="5" day="19" year="2011">Of all the songs ever written this song has touched my life more than words can say. It has ministered to me in my weakest moments and has touched me in my most joyful times. His love is immeasurable. It truly goes to the lowest hell but it still reaches to the highest star. It has in my life!</article>
	<article author="Michael Harrison" email="" city="Kington" provst="St. Andrew" country="Jamaica" month="4" day="11" year="2011">This song evokes tears of gratitude and amazement each time I hear it. Its poetic lines engave a poignant message on my mind and heart of the extent of God's love to have given us earth and though we have spoiled it terribly He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to remind us of His love and the way He wants us to live...real life...not the 'dying' kind of life. The last stanza ultimately describes how fledgling and vain our attempt to capture in words, the wonder, the sacrificial meaning and the definitive extent of God's love would be. It can only be summed up against the image of Christ's cross! That God would rip apart something of Himself...of His unsurpassable deity...His Son...whose name is the song of heaven...whose brightness and glory outs the sun's light...could come to a sorry earth and disgracefully allow His creation to mistreat Him...The thrill of it is ineffable! Oh may I live my life in the full awareness of the depth of God's love and mercy intertwined in presenting mankind, His beloved creation, the plan of salvation.</article>

No greater song than the love of God. No greater God than what this song talks about. This song is also a testimony of the love of God. God bless you all.</article>
	<article author="Emmanuel" email="" city="Abuja" provst="Abuja" country="Nigeria" month="10" day="24" year="2010">This song is just too rich. How incomprehensive is the love of God. We must operate in His love to win the lost world.</article>
	<article author="Wm" email="" city="BK" provst="CA" country="United States" month="8" day="2" year="2010">How we need to appreciate our dear brothers in the 19th century (1801-1900). Their endeavor to experience Christ was so amazing and powerful. It continues to speak in these days. This hymn always reminds me of John 3:16: for God so love the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life.</article>

	<article author="Dean" email="" city="Montreal" provst="Qc" country="Canada" month="3" day="2" year="2010">Since Jesus Christ saved my soul from the "Hell" that awaited it, I have never known a Love so profound and real as the Love of my Saviour, who took all my sin and shame! Dying in the stead of a wicked and vile creature as I am! I will forever sing this song and be comforted in a true Love that I pray all men may come to know, who Christ alone teacheth!! (Job 36:22) "Behold, God exalteth by His power: who teacheth like Him?"</article>
	<article author="Bruce" email="" city="Kilgore" provst="Texas" country="United States" month="1" day="24" year="2010">Thank God for His great and measureless love! 

May He encourage, strengthen and bless you in an extra special way. 

He has proven faithful to me all my life.</article>
	<article author="Isaiah Tor" email="" city="" provst="" country="Australia" month="11" day="23" year="2009">This hymn, whilst broad in its literary span, does not treat God's love in a general sense. Its sentiment speaks of the burden and depths of God's love in verse 1, the unchanging nature of His love in verse 2, and what unbounded appreciation is required from us of His love. It is here that we realize that we must as "scribes" be learning His boundless love in His economy all the time, with hearts saturated with such good matter concerning Him (Psa. 45). The "ink" with which we write is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3) as the Spirit sheds abroad in our hearts His love. O how much do we need to write concerning the God of love, even to the extent, that we the ministers of the new covenant would be His living letters!</article>

Whatever we need is already there, He's just waiting for us either to ask or for our faith to catch up to Him.</article>
	<article author="Paul Foltz DD" email="" city="Ponce De Leon" provst="FL" country="United States" month="4" day="18" year="2008">The last verse of this song was found written on the walls of an asylum by a man thought to be demented. This shows the mysterious dealings of our God</article>
	<article author="Amos Pressley" email="" city="Lexington" provst="SC" country="U.S.A." month="9" day="10" year="2005">For almost a hundred years, Christians have known and felt the special nature of the powerful words of this song. What is not commonly known among us is the fact that one of the verses was originally written by a Jewish Rabbi!

Show one of the verses of that hymn to any Orthodox Jew, and they'll be able to recognize the words of Akdamut Milin, an Aramaic poem read on Shavuot (Pentecost). It was originally written over 900 years ago by Rabbi Mayer of Worms, Germany!

It is time that we Christian "branches" realize we do not bear the root of the tree. The root bears us. (Romans 11:18)</article>
	<article author="Sunil" email="" city="Trivandrum" provst="Kerala" country="India" month="4" day="8" year="2004">The words of this song are very true and real. God has truly blessed the writer with a good understanding of his great love.</article>
	<article author="JRR" email="" city="" provst="IN" country="U.S.A." month="7" day="2" year="2003">I first heard this song at a concert featuring Kirk Talley in a little church in Sweetser, Indiana. It was near the end of the concert and he asked that anyone who knew it to sing with him. As Kirk began to sing accapella the whole church joined in. I cannot forget the beauty of the harmony in the voices that night. A harmony that was sung from the personal experience of knowing God's great love. No other testimony was needed as these voices sang of how God has loved them. As I sit and write, I think of who I am and what I know about me, and my heart aches to know that God loves me anyway!</article>
	<article author="Barbara Stallworth" email="" city="" provst="GA" country="U.S.A." month="6" day="29" year="2003">God's faithfulness is the greatest. No matter what we think or do He is totally present to forgive us and guide us to goodness. He is so forgiving and He loves us so much He gave His only Son. All I have needed Jehovah Jireh.</article>
	<article author="Jennifer C. Therisod" email="" city="Providence, RI/Austin" provst="TX" country="U.S.A." month="4" day="30" year="2003">This song touches me so much because of speaks of the wonderful love of God. I so appreciate this love — it is a love that is beyond words and that we cannot describe. Undeserving as we may be, God still has this wondrous love for us. Praise Him.</article>
