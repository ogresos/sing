Then I was a college brother, now, 25-26 years later serving with the dear college saints, I hope it would capture and solidify an absolute consecration in them as it did in me at that time. Today, I would still say" Lord I love You, Lord I need You, every day Lord I do. I really can't make it, and I do hate it when I'm not with You". Lord Jesus, gain a group of those who love You at any cost for Your purpose and plan.</article>

We were blending with another locality back in the late 90's and after that I never sang it again as I could not find the lyrics. Now more that 10+ years I found through this website. Praise the Lord!!! I treasure this song as it has the line of life and death. At the end God accomplishes His goal in the line of life.</article>

The Lord came down to earth, not only to save man, but also to obtain His bride, the church. The Lord has such a love for His church, a love so great which nothing can break, a love which He would never forsake. The church is God's good pleasure. It was in His heart in eternity past. The church is what makes God happy.</article>

May we keep responding to Him to let Him fill us.</article>
