After working for a time in a bank, he left and devoted his entire time to the ministry. The first years of his ministry were spent around Dublin, but he later moved to Cheltenham in England. He spent the rest of his life visiting and attending assemblies in England. C. H. Mackintosh, a Brethren writer, was his neighbor and intimate friend. - Songs of the Spirit by Martin
-----------------
The original of this song was written in the plural, using "we" and "our" instead of "I" and "my".
-------------
The original 2nd 1/2 of stanza 1 is harder to sing:
As strangers then to God we lived,
 Filled with enmity and fear;
 Our souls from death He has reprieved,
 Love revealed and brought us near.</article>

The One on the throne is the one who bore my sentence of punishment.</article>
