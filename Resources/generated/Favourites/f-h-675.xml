	<article author="Edward" email="hyim104@students.bju.edu" city="Statesboro" provst="GA" country="United States" month="2" day="23" year="2013">Before I was saved, I kept denying God's providence because I was too proud.
However, right before I was saved, I had to go to public school from private school because of my family's financial problem and because the private school was not that better than public school. I thought I was gonna be in private school for the 2nd year as well, but I realized that there must be God who is in control to let me go to public school. You know, even though I wished I could be in private school, I couldn't. 2 months after that, I was saved. That event helped me a lot to believe in God and accept Jesus Christ as my personal Savior. 

I am currently a nursing major in Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina, United States. Even though it is a wonderful program, the Lord has shown me that I am really really interested in map and GPS when I was helping my dad find a destination in Sydney, Australia and I kept riding subway a lot by myself in Seoul, Korea and I kept walking a lot and found a lot of ways in Sydney and Seoul. Also, during last Christmas break, when my mom and I went to Book's A Million in my current hometown, instead of Anatomy or biology book, I kept looking at US travelling places, maps, national parks, etc. The Lord directed me to be interested in maps and various places on the earth to know about His creation, nature, meadow, woodland, forest, ocean, park, etc.

I also kept looking at Google Maps to find out where the students in BJU are from like CA, MD, AZ, PA, CT, ME, etc.

So my prayer is that the Lord would guide me to go to another college to study more about maps/geography more interestingly with more joy than nursing. For Bob Jones doesn't have geography.

Bob Jones University is a great college, and its nursing program is really great even throughout the United Staes, but the Lord started directing me to study more about geography to know about His omnipresence and marvellous creation.

I kept sinning because I kept forgetting that God is omnipresent to see me sinning, so I really desire to know more deeply that God is omnipresent in Asia, Europe, Africa, North and South America, Antartica, Greenland, and Arctic.

Lord, help me and guide me to go to another university that You want for me to learn about your omnipresence. This is my prayer. Through my 1st year of study in BJU in nursing, I thank You for teaching me about our body system that You created.

I pray that You would help me to bravely move to another college to learn about geography.

May Your name be praised and glorified as I study more about the earth, geography, and maps.</article>
