	<article author="Christian Matney" email="" city="" provst="Texas" country="United States" month="1" day="13" year="2014">Ever since I was a very, very young child, I have always had a very strong and clear singing voice, and the first verse of this one hymn in particular has become the hymn that I always sing in a time of fear. I do not know why this hymn became the one, in fact, I do not remember learning it or even ever hearing anyone else sing it, but this song pulled me through many fears that I experienced. As I sang, the fear would slowly leave, until one day I no longer feared. The Lord has become my strength, and I can honestly say that I do not fear anything anymore.</article>

I have listened to it and sang it over and over this July 4th weekend 2013. Our 3 grandchildren 4, 5, 10, hovered around my computer as we sang the lyrics with this precious accompaniment. They all learned it and LOVED it and sang it outside when we camped out.  The Holy Spirit inspired the lyrics and this piano music. Rejoicing with you in Christ.</article>

Lord, Your light drives darkness away.
Lord, Your light is guiding us onwards,
Preparing us for the coming wedding day.

Lord, as I go through this valley You said You are with me. I won't try to get out, this will only make this valley longer. Then, I will simply rest. This will shorten the valley. You are with me, O Precious One, Dear Beloved Shepherd. I rest.</article>

	<article author="Sis LC" email="" city="" provst="" country="New Zealand" month="5" day="1" year="2011">Isa 40:25-26, To whom will you liken Me, That I should be compared? Says the Holy One. Lift up your eyes on high, And see who has created these thingsâ€¦

We had a young people camp over the weekend at a beautiful location among the mountains, valleys and the sea. As we lifted up our eyes while we sang this song, we could see how beautiful our creator must be.

And He is more beautiful than the creation that we see. When people, matters, and things, turn away from us, He will never turn away from us. When things start to get ugly, He will remain beautiful forever. "The grass withers and the flower fades, But the word of our God will stand forever(Isa 40:8)". There is nothing more precious than our God. "There is no comparison between Him and anyone or anything else (Isa 40:25 footnote 1)"

The most astonishing fact is that this beautiful God did not remain outside of us. He became a life giving Spirit to impart Himself as life to us (1Cor. 15:45b). How beautiful this is! God is now mingled with us as one organic entity. We possess the divine life of the One who is beyond comparision! He is precious, people! Let's tell the nations how beautiful our God is! He is worthy of our praise!</article>

	<article author="Esther" email="" city="Folsom" provst="CA" country="United States" month="4" day="6" year="2010">This is a good song for drawing our hearts back to Him, and it gives Him an opening to reveal how precious He is to us. Singing this while beholding a sunset or ocean does amazing things to the heart, but it's also a good song for letting us step outside of our outward situation and realize He is all we need.</article>
