I just do them without even thinking about them; yet the hymn writer separates all things unto Him. Her oneness with God in all that she does shows forth His glory. "...whatever you do, do all to the glory of God" (1 Cor. 10:31). I want to be separated unto God in all, that He would be displayed in the small details of my life.</article>
