She specifically wrote "through His blood...". Here blood is replaced by life. She is correct in the original. If He had not shed his blood, His life makes no difference to us.</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="Mi" country="United States" month="1" day="19" year="2014">"My father, the Reverend A. J. Shea, and I were on an afternoon shopping trip for Mother, as I recall. When we came out of a store in Houghton, NY, where we had recently moved from Winchester, Ontario, we met a tall, elderly woman making her way slowly up the street. She was walking in that slow, mincing step older people sometimes do, cautious not to lose balance.
Dad tipped his hat and said good-day to her as we passed. She stopped and looked up to see who was speaking. Smiling sweetly, she returned his greeting.
'Do you know who that was, Son?' he asked me on the way. I turned and watched as she continued her careful progress. Though a distinguished woman (whom I would now describe as looking a lot like Whistler's Mother) I had no idea who she was.
'That,' said Dad, 'was Mrs. Clara Tear Williams. She writes hymns.' There was a near reverence in his voice, and though I was only 8 years old, I was duly impressed. 
When Dad and I got home that afternoon, I told Mother about meeting Mrs. Williams, the hymn writer. She smiled knowingly and nodded her head. Then, she went to the piano bench and found a hymnal that contained one of Clara Tear Williams' compositions.
Placing the book on the music rack and sitting down to the piano, Mother began playing that song with me on the bench beside her. It was beautiful. Up until then, I guess I figured all the songs we sung in church were written and published by people who lived in far off places like New York. I couldn't get over the fact that we had a real live composer in our very own town.
A few years later, when I was in my teens and began to sing solos, I memorized the hymn that Mother played that day and sang it. It was entitled 'Satisfied' or 'All My Life Long.' - George Beverly Shea in 'Songs that Lift the Heart'</article>

	<article author="Daning" email="" city="Malaybalay" provst="" country="Philippines" month="6" day="7" year="2012">Indeed, there is no other life that we should ever long for. Only Christ's life in us -- as Paul states in Gal. 2:20, "I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave Himself for me." Hallelujah what a Savior!</article>
	<article author="Judy" email="" city="Halifax" provst="Nova Scotia" country="Canada" month="10" day="23" year="2011">To Sherry of USA: Make peace with the past and then bury it. Accept who you are today and go from here. Understand that we all are human and make mistakes; we have eaten from the husks that surrounded us but God's grace brought us to the well of water and now we are able to lift our heads with the dignity that only Christ can give.</article>
	<article author="Brad" email="" city="" provst="" country="Germany" month="9" day="4" year="2011">The order of the verses should probably be governed by the content of the last verse that summarizes the themes of thirst, hunger, and riches. This was our song of the day in our family devotions this morning. May I encourage people to feed on Colossians 2:9-10. Christ is all, and in Him we find fulfillment.</article>
	<article author="Sherry" email="" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="11" day="7" year="2010">Please pray for me. I have walked with God for over 30 years, yet when I sing this song it just points out that I still long to have the pain and sorrow erased from my heart so that when I shout &amp; sing Hallelujah I have found Him there isn't a hollow echo in my heart. I want to find the peace that passes understanding and the joy that never fades.</article>
