    <article author="Frank Pytel" email="" city="Chicago" provst="Illinois" country="United States" month="3" day="13" year="2010">Our unchanging Christ is changing us! He is before all things, and all things have Him as the goal (Col. 1:17,16; Eph. 1:10). God has given Him the first place in all things of the first creation and of the new creation (Col. 1:18). When we come in contact with the preeminent Christ, a good work begins in us which He will complete for God's good pleasure (Phil. 1:7; 2:13)! He is the first and the last of God's good pleasure, and He is the first and the last in our revelation, experience and service!</article>
