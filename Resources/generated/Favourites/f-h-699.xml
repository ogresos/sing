With forbidden pleasures would this vain world charm,
Or its sordid treasures spread to work me harm;
Bring to my remembrance sad Gethsemane,
Or, in darker semblance, cross-crowned Calvary.

Also the original last verse is different, speaking of death instead of the Lord's return:

When my last hour cometh, fraught with strife and pain,
When my dust returneth to the dust again,
On Thy truth relying, through that mortal strife;
Jesus, take me, dying, to eternal life.</article>
    <article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="Michigan" country="United States" month="2" day="6" year="2013">James Montgomery's missionary parents died when he was 12. Soon after that, he was asked to leave school because he couldn't turn in his assignments on time. After working at a couple of bakeries, he left for London, where he thought he could sell his poetry. Instead he got a job with a newspaper. When the editor fled England to avoid prosecution, 23-year-old James Montgomery assumed that role. After he commemorated the fall of the Bastille, he was fined, imprisoned, and called "a wicked, malicious and seditious person." 
In time he was honored by the British government for his outspoken advocacy of humanitarian causes, especially the abolition of slavery. As he read the story of Simon Peter in the Gospels, he identified with that disciple. "I have pleaded in prayer for you, Simon, that your faith should not fail", Jesus told Peter (Luke 22:32). - Great Songs of Faity by Brown &amp; Norton</article>
