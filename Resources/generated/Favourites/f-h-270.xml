Spirit of God, descend upon my heart;
 Wean it from earth; through all its pulses move;
 Stoop to my weakness, mighty as Thou art;
 And make me love Thee as I ought to love.
----------------------
The original stanza 3, line 1 says "me" instead of "us", and stanzas 3 &amp; 4 are in reverse order.
-----------------------
The original last stanza says:
Teach me to love Thee as Thine angels love,
 One holy passion filling all my frame;
 The baptism of the heav'n-descended Dove,
 My heart an altar, and Thy love the flame.
---------------
In the last stanza, 3rd line, "baptism" is changed to "kindling", "fullness" or "presence" in most hymnals to make it easier to sing as 2 syllables.</article>
    <article author="IrisCrystal Seok" email="tgnrsvt@yahoo.com" city="" provst="" country="South Korea" month="1" day="12" year="2014">This lyric reminds me of one of the ministry messages: 
“The Bible tells us that we have three different enemies: (1) the flesh—in us. (2) the world—outside of us, and (3) Satan—above and below us. According to the ascended position of the church, Satan is under us…. The flesh is set against the Holy Spirit (Gal. 5:17). The world opposes the Father (1 Jn. 2:15). And Satan contends with Christ (1 Jn. 3:8). We thus see that the flesh is overcome by walking after the Spirit; the world is overcome by loving the Father; and Satan is overcome by believing in Christ… Unshaken by outward and inward forces, this is victory. No flesh activating itself within, no worldly attraction or instigation stirring without, and no Satanic ground being yielded to beneath—that is victory. Throughout His life, our Lord never lived according to the flesh. He had set the flesh so completely aside that He was the first man in whom Satan had absolutely nothing. Neither the flesh nor the world nor the devil had any place in Him…
Therefore, God’s overcomers must forsake all self-complacencies, pay the cost, let the cross cut off all that comes out of the old creation, and stand against the gates of Hates (Matt. 16:18).
Are you willing to hurt your own heart that you may gain God’s heart? Are you ready to let yourself be defeated so that the Lord may triumph? When your obedience is made full, God will quickly avenge all the disobedience (2 Cor. 10:6).”

It also reminds me of one sentence from a minister:
“Let my heart be broken with the things that the Heart of God.”</article>
    <article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="5" day="17" year="2013">George Croly came from Ireland to minister in a small parish church in London. During his 25 years of service there he had much time for writing and became known for poems, novels, biographies and plays. Then when he was 50 years old, he was asked to reopen a church in one of London's worst slums that had been closed for more than a century. Croly's preaching soon attracted crowds. At the age of 74, he prepared a new hymnal for the congregation, including this hymn under the title "Holiness Desired." In this hymn he shuts the door and asks for a fresh filling of the Spirit. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown and Norton</article>
