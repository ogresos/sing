	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="4" day="9" year="2013">Robert Lowry wrote both the words and music to this hymn in 1874. At the time, he was professor of literature at Bucknell University in Pennsylvania and was pastor of a nearby church. He had written other hymn tunes and texts as he practiced his passion for poetry and song. "Sometimes the music comes and the words follow," he explained once. "I watch my moods, and when anything strikes me, whether words or music, no matter where I am, at home, on the street, I jot it down. My brain is sort of a spinning machine, for there is music running through it all the time." - Great Songs of Faith by Brown and Norton</article>
