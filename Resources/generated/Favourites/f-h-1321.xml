Saints should we not delight to give ourselves in every way and let The Lord dispense Himself into us! The grace we receive is God Himself wrought into us, that day to shine over all! Let us all cooperate with this grace!
"by the grace of God I am what I am, His grace unto me did not turn out to be in vain, but on the contrary, I labored more abundantly then all of them, Yet not I, but the grace of God that is with me" 1 Cor. 15:10</article>
