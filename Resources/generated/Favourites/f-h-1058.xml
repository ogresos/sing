The best that religion can do is expose your sin and if you are honest with yourself you have to agree guilty as charged. The only problem is your Powerless to do anything about it...but Praise The Lord! when we're born again and receive Power from on High, God in Christ in us as the hope of Glory and realize it is no longer I but Christ who lives in me and start applying that Dunamis Power And let God energize us with that Kratos Power we are truly saved from "its guilt and power".</article>
	<article author="Benedict Olatomide Omole" email="olaomole2000@yahoo.co.uk" city="London" provst="Lewsham" country="United Kingdom" month="6" day="24" year="2015">Interestingly enough this hymn is a great reminder of SAVING GRACE. The Cleft of the Rock is our hiding place from the fiery and devastating wrath of God against the original sin which gave birth to personal sin. God has to judge sin otherwise His Word would be an empty threat and His integrity lost. Hence while sin is being actually and literally judged believers in Jesus Christ are safe until His wrath will have passed by. Jesus' body cut open as our eternal Rock of ages and two purposes served. One is that the cleft is our hiding place because sinful man will die by judgement if he appear in God's holy sight and as the Rock cleaves the price of redemption is being paid. Each time we call Jesus Name in faith and knowledge of this truth we remind God of the Blood of PASSOVER to the next person or place and if the next person too is washed in the pool of Blood of the substitute and sacrifice the wrath of God jumps to the next and stay to slay when He finds one out of the cleft on his own standing out of pride aloof.</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="7" day="19" year="2013">Converted under a Methodist evangelist while attending the University of Dublin, Augustus Toplady decided to prepare for the ministry. Though impressed with the spirit of Methodism, he strongly disagreed with the Wesleys' Arminian theology and waged a running battle with them through tracts, sermons, and even hymns. "Wesley," said Toplady, "is guilty of Satan's shamelessness." Wesley retorted, "I do not fight with chimney sweeps!"
Toplady wrote "Rock of Ages" to conclude a magazine article in which he emphasized that, just as England could never repay its national debt, so humans through their own efforts could never satisfy the eternal justice of God. He died of tuberculosis and overwork at the age of 38, 2 years after he published his own hymnal, in which "Rock of Ages" and Charles Wesley's "Jesus, Lover of My Soul" were placed side by side. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown and Norton

Stanza one here is the original published by Toplady in his 1776 hymnal. Many versions have the last line of the stanza as "Save from wrath and make me pure."</article>

	<article author="Rosita Enriquez" email="" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="1" day="9" year="2012">"The blood refers to the precious blood shed by the Lord to deal with our outward sinful acts (John 1:29; Heb. 9:22), and the water refers to the life imparted by the Lord to deal with our inward sinful nature (John 19:34).

(Truth, Life, the Church and the Gospel-the Four Great Pillars in the Lord's Recovery, pp 126-127)

	<article author="Dr Johannes Maas" email="" city="Jomtien Beach" provst="Chonburi" country="Thailand" month="3" day="16" year="2010">The words of this hymn are among the most profound, inspiring, encouraging, sacred, devotional, and precious words ever penned.
While Toplady was a Calvinist, the words, "Be of sin the double cure, Save from wrath , and make me pure," seem to suggest his acceptance of the teachings of his contemporary, John Wesley, who taught the “double cure,” in which a sinner is cleansed by the blood of Jesus, and enabled to live a holy life by the infilling of the Holy Spirit.
And the words, “Thou must save and Thou alone,” remind me of the inspiring words of Wesley in the funeral sermon of John Fletcher, another contemporary of Toplady:
"For his last months, he scarce ever lay down or rose up without these words in his mouth: -- I nothing have, I nothing am; My treasure's in the bleeding Lamb, Both now and evermore. "In one of the letters which he wrote some time since to his dear people of Madeley, some of his words are, "I leave this blessed island for awhile, but I trust I shall never leave the kingdom of God, -- the shadow of Christ's cross, -- the clefts of the Rock, smitten and pierced for us. There I meet you in spirit; thence, I trust, I shall joyfully leap into the ocean of eternity, to go and join those ministering spirits who wait on the heirs of salvation. And if I am no more allowed to minister to you on earth, I rejoice at the thought that I shall perhaps be allowed to accompany the angels who, if you abide in the faith, will be commissioned to carry you into Abraham's bosom.' "The thought enlivens my faith! Lord give me to walk in his steps! Then shall I see him again, and my heart shall rejoice, and we shall eternally behold the Lamb together. Faith brings near the welcome moment! And now he beckons me away, and Jesus bids me come!" 
May the words of this greatest of hymns and the other great hymns of the church bless and inspired you as the have me in my 50 years of service in the Lord’s kingdom.</article>

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="8" day="25" year="2009">God saves fallen human beings by resolving the problem of sins and by dealing with our sin. The hymn "Rock of Ages, Cleft for Me" (Hymns, #1058) is a good Christian song. It is a valuable, classic Christian hymn. The key point of this hymn is found in the last lines of the first stanza: "Let the water and the blood, / From Thy riven side which flowed, / Be of sin the double cure, / Save me from its guilt and power." Guilt is due to our outward sinful deeds and shows that we have received eternal punishment; power refers to the power of the sinful nature within us. How can we resolve the problem of sin and sins? It is through the water and the blood which flowed from the Lord's riven side. The blood redeems us from the eternal punishment related to our sins, and the water saves us from the power of sin. This is the double cure mentioned in this hymn. Therefore, this hymn is well written, and the truth in it is very clear.

This shows that we must have a thorough knowledge of the truth. "Let the water and the blood, / From Thy riven side which flowed, / Be of sin the double cure, / Save me from its guilt and power." The Lord's blood washes away our outward transgressions and saves us from the guilt of eternal punishment. The water denotes the Lord's resurrection life, which enters into us and is the power to deliver us from the power of sin. In Romans 7:24 Paul said, "Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of this death?" He is speaking of our inward, sinful nature. In 8:1 Paul says, "There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus." The condemnation here does not refer to being condemned to go to the lake of fire but to the condemning within us. Many husbands do not want to lose their temper with their wife. They set their will and pray, but they still lose their temper. After getting angry, they condemn themselves for being wretched, and they wonder who can save them. However, there is now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, because the law of the Spirit of life has freed us from the law of sin and of death (v. 2). This is what is referred to in the line of the hymn "Save me from its...power." The blood redeems us outwardly, and the life saves us inwardly. Redemption delivers us from our sinful deeds, and salvation delivers us from our sinful nature.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="4" day="28" year="2008">The hymns are another tool for preaching the gospel. We can preach the gospel to others by singing hymns, such as Hymns, #1058. I translated this hymn into Chinese, and Brother Nee polished it and made some improvements, including my translation of the line "Be of sin the double cure." The first cure for sin deals with the record of our sins before God, for which we should receive eternal punishment. The second cure for sin deals with the law of sin within us, which brings us under the ruling of the power of sin. This hymn also speaks of "the water and the blood" that flowed from the Lord's side. The blood deals with the record of our sins before God, and the water denotes the law of the Spirit of life. This law enables us to overcome the law of sin and of death (Rom. 8:2). I mention this because I hope that some young people may be raised up to learn to write hymns.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="27" year="2008">Hymns, #1058, verse 1 says, "Rock of Ages, cleft for me, / Let me hide myself in Thee; / Let the water and the blood, / From Thy riven side which flowed, / Be of sin the double cure, / Save me from its guilt and power." We have a double problem. On the one hand, we have a record of sins before God. On the other hand, we have the nature of sin within us. Only the blood and water can be the double cure for our sin. On the one hand, the redemptive blood redeems us that we may escape the eternal punishment for sins. On the other hand, the water of life saves us that we may be delivered from the power of sin. Sin not only causes man to suffer eternal punishment, but it also has the power, which is the law of sin, to dominate man from within. In our natural life we have no way to overcome the law of sin and of death, but the law of the Spirit of life can free us in Christ from the law of sin and of death. Only the precious blood can solve the problems concerning our condemned position and our record of sins. Only the Spirit of life can solve our problem concerning the law of sin and of death. God's full salvation consists not only of the redemption through the precious blood but also of the salvation by the Spirit of life.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="25" year="2008">The writer of this hymn refers to the "double cure." His redemption gives us a double cure. First He washes away our sins, and second He regenerates us. His blood saves us from the guilt of sin and His life saves us from the power of sin. In His redemption Christ can give us a double cure—He washes away our filthiness and He keeps away our death. This double cure is His redemptive work, yet for us to enjoy His redemptive work, we must be willing to be imprisoned in His death. While we are in His death, He has the position to secrete Himself around our being. Then we will surely receive the double cure and we will be produced as pearls for the entry into God's building.

This very godly person, when he counted his sins, considered that every second he committed at least one sin. That is to say that in ten years, there were more than three hundred million sins. Therefore, he wrote that glorious hymn which caused millions of people, who were tired and oppressed by sin, to find rest—"Rock of Ages, cleft for me, / Let me hide myself in Thee"! He wrote:

Oh, is there one as pitiable as I in this world! Besides weakness and sin I have nothing. In my flesh there is no good thing, and how surprising that I could be tempted to view myself so high. The best work I have done in my life only qualifies me to be condemned.

But when he was dying of tuberculosis in London, he leaned his sinful head on the breast of the Savior and said, "I am the happiest man in this world."
