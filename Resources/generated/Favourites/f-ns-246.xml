	<article author="Joey" email="mariejoy.anhaw@gmail.com" city="Iligan City" provst="" country="" month="4" day="11" year="2014">Listening to this hymn is very timely. I want to share this experience of mine, the shepherding that this song has provided me since I had not seen any saint around the boarding house to share this with. hehehe. so here goes: My college days are finally over. The series of events has ended. What now? What next? I've been very busy for quite a while and now, all those things had come to an end. No more paper works and sleepless nights. Thank God those days were finally over. But why do I feel unsatisfied? Why do I feel something is still missing, something that I did not accomplish. Didn't I hit the target when I finished college? Truly it is vain to accomplish something of the world without consecrating it to the Lord. All this time, it was just me. I did not consider the Lord a part of me. We were apart all this time because if we’re not, I would not feel discontent. It has been 2 weeks when I last had my private time with the Lord in the morning. I feel very lonely deep inside, and I’m sure the Lord feels the same way too. I've been very busy for the graduation ceremony, the requirements I had to finish, the deadlines I had to beat, that I forgot to make time with my God. I've been thinking about this condition lately and still could not find a solution to it. Then my sister asked me to play a song and choose this. While listening, the lyrics hit me. There and back again. Thank You Lord, you are everything. You are the lyrics of this hymn, you are the song itself. Lord, you are my song. Lord Jesus, draw us nearer. Gain us fully, Lord. Be my reality.</article>

	<article author="Ryan Armstrong" email="ryanmarmstrong@comcast.net" city="Highlands" provst="TX" country="United States" month="3" day="21" year="2013">This hymn is SO full of reality! I'm so thankful it's on the latest NYCYPCD. Through them I've heard it for the first time! This is a precious stanza to me:

Mold me, shape me, Lord.
Be my reality.
Even break my heart,
If it has to be.
I’m desperate, Lord, that You would have Your way with me.
Others could touch You then through me.

Lord, gain what You must through me! I'm just open to You! Lord Jesus, I love You!</article>

Hallelujah!</article>

Set my heart aflame.
Don't let me stay the same.
Don't let things remain
Which now grieve You.
My life I give to You and all I've claimed as mine.
May I just hold, Lord, unto You.
Amen!</article>
	<article author="Ashlynne Macnee" email="" city="Arlington" provst="Texas" country="United States" month="1" day="6" year="2011">This song is exactly what I long for.
I feel like it was written just for me.  :)

"Lord, I've seen Your purpose.
Your heart's unveiled to me.
Now I'd just like to see You gain me fully."</article>
	<article author="Glenn" email="" city="Quezon City" provst="" country="Philippines" month="1" day="4" year="2011">I always grieve the Lord, I am so hard-headed yet not a moment did He take His eyes off me. Oh the everlasting love of God! This hymn is for desperate lovers of Christ. I am so desperate, I have no peace until I get to know this hymn. Saints it's only a matter of time - let's rally forward for the reward. Let's not lose our first and best love for Him.</article>
	<article author="Ing" email="" city="Taipei" provst="" country="Taiwan" month="4" day="26" year="2010">Amen. This is my first time seeing this hymn. The lyrics is exactly what my heart wants to say. Even though my life seems all deformed, and I'm often drifted away, but He'd draw me yet again, and keep me running after Him.</article>
	<article author="aiza varquez" email="" city="pagadian city" provst="zamboanga del sur" country="Philippines" month="8" day="7" year="2009">Amen! I really like this song because the Lord showed us how much He loves us and that we are really chosen by Him.</article>
	<article author="Michael Paulo Zamora" email="" city="Meycauayan" provst="Bulacan" country="Philippines" month="8" day="7" year="2009">This song reminds me when I saw the vision of God's buliding and consecrated myself to the Lord. It also reflects my experiences of being in the valleys of my Christian life. Once we have seen the Heavenly Vision, once we have consecrated ourselves to the Lord, we are at index of His eyes, and we have no choice but to be fully gained by the Lord for His economy. Thus we become overcomers not by ourselves but by His mercy and dispensing. Amen.</article>
	<article author="hana sutjiawang" email="" city="singapore" provst="" country="Singapore" month="7" day="27" year="2009">We may often drift away even without realizing. We have to ask the Lord to continue to draw us, mole us, shape us, even break our heart if it has to be. We have to be desperate to lay hold of Him. O Lord, even keep us in the index of Your eyes. It is difficult to even run after the prize, but do remember that you are not alone! We have the brothers and sister with us! O even the most precious One, the Lord Himself is with us. So Praise the Lord, saints! let run towards the prize together.</article>
	<article author="Ed" email="" city="Fremont" provst="California" country="United States" month="7" day="16" year="2009">I first learned this hymn on a trip to Washington State last year. Since then, I've had my ups - and plenty of downs in my Christian life. But now, much more than before, I find myself loving Him more and more each day. 

The words of this hymn - Seeking for the Lord, by any means, to keep me running after Him - become my daily prayer. 

Often, we drift away from Him - and more: we try to compromise with the Lord regarding our heart and time towards Him. 

Give yourself to love the Lord, regardless of situations or how you feel at present - stop, and seek to turn to Him, desperate for Him, and Him alone. 

I pray, "Lord, I give myself to You; gain me, Lord, fully; Consecrated to You, Lord, alone; I'm desperate for You Lord; turn me Lord to You."</article>
	<article author="Ravikumar" email="" city="Chennai" provst="Tamilnadu" country="India" month="7" day="15" year="2009">This hymn perfectly matches my heart's longing. Praise the Lord for His love that draws us near... Hallelujah!!! The following lines are very impressive. "I ask You that You'd draw me yet again"

"Even break my heart,
If it has to be."

"Don't let things remain
Which now grieve You."
Amen!!!</article>
	<article author="Teresa" email="" city="Lower Hutt" provst="" country="New Zealand" month="7" day="15" year="2009">This song always touches me. We all have times where we're feeling up or down, and I think this song is suited for when we are feeling down.

We've seen what the Lord's revealed to us, and through this song we can be refreshed and return to the Lord, even in our doubtful situations. May the Lord be our REALITY - this is through our willingness to turn to the Lord; the Lord will gain us FULLY! We need to be willing for the Lord to work in us, He'll draw us even more to Him each time! It's not on our own that we can do things, we fail all the time (even when we try to "compromise" with the Lord), but the Lord can gain us through our willingness~ :)</article>
	<article author="Jenny" email="" city="" provst="" country="Malaysia" month="7" day="5" year="2009">This song succinctly utters my longing to the Lord. Though I love Him, my life seems all deformed and I easily drifted away from Him. May the Lord pull, push and lay hold of me that I may just hold unto Him. Oh, to live for Christ and the church is the sole purpose I seek in life.</article>
