When Mary saw His supremacy, she responded by pouring out all she had on Him! When Paul saw His supremacy, his estimation of all his personal gain was as loss and garbage. Every letter Paul wrote showed how far above and excellent Christ was in comparison to everything! How daily I need revelations of Him to constantly value Him more than all else to me.</article>
    <article author="Isaiah Tor" email="" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="9" day="29" year="2008">The supremacy of Christ is not only objectively recognised but is also subjectively and deeply received and experienced by the writer, as encompassing all our lives. Particularly we see the aspect of God's organic salvation in the later verses of this hymn as a spontaneous result of being under His headship.</article>
