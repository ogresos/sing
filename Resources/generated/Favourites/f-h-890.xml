Christ is Victor, therefore do and dare! Lord You're on the throne no matter where we are or what we're going through. Therefore we dare - even to pray things we deem impossible, to pray for places far away from us, to pray for Your move...Lord, send us in prayer wherever You desire!</article>

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="9" year="2010">According to our experience, there are a few benefits to calling or crying loudly. First, when a person is depressed, shouting and calling loudly can help him come out of his depression. Formerly, my only way out of feeling depressed and unable to pray in a meeting was to call a hymn. Often I sang loudly, "Hallelujah! Christ is Victor, / Tell with every breath" (Hymns, #890), and eight out often times the depression I felt within was removed through singing. Now I have found the secret: if I feel depressed in any kind of meeting, I can say loudly with my spirit, "O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!" In this way death vanishes, and Satan flees away.

...
Sin and death are the product of Satan. Sin came from Satan and issues in death (Rom. 5:12). However, Satan was destroyed by Christ, sin was taken away through Christ's death, and death was nullified by Christ's appearing in the flesh. Moreover, our old man, which was corrupted by Satan, sin, and death, was terminated by being crucified with Christ. All these items are included in the bruising of the serpent's head by the seed of the woman. These are the achievements of Christ as the seed of the woman.

Too often we let something dim our vision and make our vision so vague. This is our sinfulness. If we would confess our sins thoroughly, this thorough confession would clear the sky. Then our vision could never be dim. Go wherever He would send you. Do not let anything dim your vision. Go by rising up and being filled with the consummated Spirit essentially and economically.
