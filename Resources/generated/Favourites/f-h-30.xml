	<article author="C" email="" city="London" provst="Ontario" country="Canada" month="8" day="23" year="2013">We often sing this hymn at the Lord's table and I enjoy it very much. I find that when the Lord, His Person and His economy, are the centre of our praises and our prayers, wow, the meeting is so enjoyable! The content of this hymn is so rich and it really leads us to worship the Father for His love and His wonderful economy. I also find the tune is helpful in leading me to touch the content of the hymn and exercise my spirit. Praise You dear Father for Your eternal purpose and Your wonderful economy! Praise You for revealing Your heart to us and making Your will known to us. Thank You Father that it is through imparting Your very life and Person into us that You will gain what You are after. Thank You that only through Your life can Your purpose be accomplished. What wisdom! Thank You for including us in Your wonderful purpose. Throughout Thy transformation work, Thou dost direct each one, from glory unto glory bring until the work is done! Hallelujah!</article>
