	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="12" day="29" year="2014">There is a 3rd stanza:
’Twas wondrous love which led Him 
for us to suffer loss,
To bear without a murmur 
the anguish of the cross;
With saints redeemed in glory, 
let us our voices raise,
Till Heav’n and earth re-echo 
with our Redeemer’s praise.</article>

	<article author="李 菲 麗" email="" city="" provst="NC" country="United States" month="4" day="6" year="2011">O Lord Jesus!I am deeply impressed by the author and composer, Mrs. Lelia Morris, who had absolutely consecrated her life and living serving the Lord. She continued to write gospel songs during the last fifteen years of her life, even after going blind in her early fifties. “Sweeter as the Years Go By” was written during the early years of her blindness. It is said that during this difficult time in her life, Mrs. Morris used a 28-foot long blackboard with music lines on it to help her hymn writing. In all, Lelia Morris wrote more than 1000 hymn texts, as well as many of the tunes. Her handicap never deterred her from being effective and productive for God. Even in blindness she found her Lord sweeter as the years went by.</article>

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="4" day="7" year="2008">However, every spiritual matter can be confirmed by practical things. We thank the Lord for this. This is God's sovereign arrangement. For example, Hymn #231 in the Chinese hymnal borrows the good wine and sweet honey of our daily life, the great sea and vast ocean on earth, and the sun and moon in heaven to depict the Lord's love. All these things describe the Lord's love...
