	<article author="Rebecca" email="rypeacock@yahoo.ca" city="Toronto" provst="ON" country="Canada" month="12" day="31" year="2013">I enjoyed in the Winter Training on message 10. Abraham dug wells in Beer-Sheba and later redeemed them with seven ewe lambs. This is Elim, where it's flourishing with 12 springs and 70 palm trees. But over time, it got covered up with dirt and other things. Isaac didn't have to dig new wells, but just open them up through digging. This is like our heart. There is a well in our spirit flowing with water and it's covenanted by The Lord. But we need to dig away the dirt that accumulated that the water can flow again!</article>
