Brother Paul exhorts Timothy that petitions, prayers, intercessions and thanksgivings be made on behalf of all men. He wanted his dear children to pray...,to have a proper church life we need a prayer life. If our talking is turned into praying, the church in our locality will be transformed.</article>

    <article author="Frank Pytel" email="" city="Chicago" provst="Illinois" country="United States" month="1" day="31" year="2010">This song reminded me of Peter when the Lord told him, "when you were young you walked where you would, but when you shall be old you would be carried where you would not" (John 21:18). How often in our natural zeal we do spiritual things "as we would." May Christ lead us, and may He be the value of all, even when it is "not where we elect to go."</article>
