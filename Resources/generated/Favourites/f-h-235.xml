Славьте, славьте, Он наш благой Искупитель,
Пой земля вся славу любви Христа.
Торжествуйте, вышние ангелы в славе,
Честь и славу наши поют уста. 
Словно Пастырь, Иисус хранит нас в мире,
В Его руки мы себя предаем.
Припев:
Славьте, славьте 
благость Его и величье,
Славьте, славьте, 
радостно мы поем
Славьте, славьте, Он наш благой Искупитель,
Он за грешных крестную смерть принял.
Он Господь и наша надежда спасенья, 
Слава, слава, людям свет воссиял. 
Наши скорби Он претерпел на древе,
Показал нам силу любви во всём.
Припев
Славьте, славьте, Он наш благой Искупитель,
Здесь и в небе славит Тебя вся тварь 
Наш Спаситель, царствуй во веки и веки,
Ты увенчан Первосвященник и Царь
Се гряди же, Господи наш Иисусе, 
В Своей славе, с Духом Святым — огнем. 
Припев</article>

	<article author="Tracy" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="1" day="22" year="2016">I agree. I love the musIc but I use a hymnal for the words. Thank you for providing this tool to help me sing praises to my Redeemer.</article>
	<article author="Jay Sax" email="jay.sax@gmail.com" city="Peyton" provst="Colorado" country="United States" month="10" day="31" year="2015">I learned this long ago to slightly different words. Do you track such things or provide tools to do so? If nothing else, would it not be most respectful to the author to either continue with the words as written, or to trace the change, the reason, etc? I would find that fascinating of itself. Maybe I learned the variant, and yours is the original!
Praise Him! Praise Him! Jesus, our blessèd Redeemer!
Sing, O Earth, His wonderful love proclaim!
Hail Him! hail Him! highest archangels in glory;
Strength and honor give to His holy Name!
Like a shepherd, Jesus will guard His children,
In His arms He carries them all day long:
Refrain
Praise Him! Praise Him!
Tell of His excellent greatness.
Praise Him! Praise Him!
Ever in joyful song!
Praise Him! Praise Him! Jesus, our blessèd Redeemer!
For our sins He suffered, and bled, and died.
He our Rock, our hope of eternal salvation,
Hail Him! hail Him! Jesus the Crucified.
Sound His praises! Jesus who bore our sorrows,
Love unbounded, wonderful, deep and strong.
Refrain
Praise Him! Praise Him! Jesus, our blessèd Redeemer!
Heav’nly portals loud with hosannas ring!
Jesus, Savior, reigneth forever and ever.
Crown Him! Crown Him! Prophet, and Priest, and King!
Christ is coming! over the world victorious,
Pow’r and glory unto the Lord belong.</article>
