First it shows us God's plan before the world was made. It's a mystery hid from ages now revealed to me. Hallelujah! Glory, glory, Christ is life in me. I love the melody. The content is wonderful. Probably have sang it a million times. Praise Him!</article>
	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="31" year="2008">Hymns, #948, #949, and #972 are all on Christ as our hope of glory. Stanza 1 of Hymns, #948 says, "Myst'ry hid from ages now revealed to me, / 'Tis the Christ of God's reality. / He embodies God, and He is life to me, / And the glory of my hope He'll be." The chorus reads, "Glory, glory, Christ is life in me! / Glory, glory, what a hope is He! / Now within my spirit He's the mystery! / Then the glory He will be to me." Stanza 2 says, "In my spirit He regenerated me, / In my soul He's now transforming me. / He will change my body like unto His own, / Wholly making me the same as He." Stanza 3 says, "Now in life and nature He is one with me; / Then in Him, the glory, I will be; / I'll enjoy His presence for eternity / With Him in complete conformity."
