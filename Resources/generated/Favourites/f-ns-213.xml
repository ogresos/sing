Itâ€™s Your word so strong that hammers stone,
That the grain of life may come to me
And supply me inwardly."

Bethany shared this stanza with the chorus this morning during the sisters reading of "The Knowledge of Life, Ch 10" O, how important is that our hear stays soft!!! Lord give us a soft heart so that the Spirit with our spirit may flow so freely out!!!! And by the spirit spreading in our heart He will make our heart happy!!!!</article>

It always urges me to read the Bible and enjoy Christ as the all-inclusive One. We may always have the burden to study and dig more of the truth. PRAISE THE LORD FOR HE IS THE WORD.</article>
