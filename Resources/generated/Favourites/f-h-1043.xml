	<article author="Joshua Kolawole Akinola" email="kolajoshua2003@gmail.com" city="Ibadan" provst="" country="Nigeria" month="11" day="27" year="2015">This song is a clarion call to all Christians to know that our candles are burning off gradually and we must be up and doing in the work of the Master as the Great Day draws near. We must also preach the gospel like a dying man to a dying world, peradventure, we may save some from eternal perdition.
"I must work the works of Him that sent me while it is day, for the night cometh when no man can work"</article>

It really reminds us that we need to keep watch and pray and we wait upon our reader. Our life is so short in this world.</article>

He went to be with the Lord in 2009, and played and sang this hymn in the 1940's. It bring back many memories.</article>
	<article author="Samuel Ruth Chadi" email="rsamchadi1010@gmail.com" city="Ikeja" provst="Lagos state" country="Nigeria" month="8" day="3" year="2014">I remember when we were growing up our choir use to sing this very song. When I lost my aunt, this very song was sang during her wake keep. Any time I remember, sing or hear this song I shared tears.  Truly and indeed the word of the Lord is sure.  Let the whole know that this life at its very best is brief indeed. Lord help me to make useful use of my time for You. This song is not only for the unsaved. Is both for the saved and unsaved.</article>
	<article author="Maureen Reid" email="chesalon17@yahoo.co.uk" city="Gardenstown" provst="Aberdeenshire" country="" month="7" day="11" year="2014">Beautiful hymn especially for the unsaved. Another in the same vein is Meet me there where the tree of life is blooming meet me there.</article>

Ireland" country="United Kingdom" month="6" day="27" year="2014">I was humming this tune today and could only remember some of the words. What a blessing to know that I'm saved and in time. Jesus is the way the truth and the life. GOD IS LOVE.</article>
	<article author="Ruth Chadi Samuel" email="samuelruth45@yahoo.com" city="Lagos" provst="State" country="Nigeria" month="11" day="15" year="2013">What a joy to belong to the family of Christ.
I new this song in the early 80's as a young child.
I grew up and became a choir member till date.
I can as well sing it in the Hausa language. If you do not have Christ, you are heading to doom. No two ways about it.
It's really a song with sober reflection to the very day I accepted Christ as my Lord and personal Savior.
Life is very very brief.......</article>
	<article author="Stanley" email="vpstanley@gmail.com" city="Calicut" provst="Kerala" country="India" month="10" day="10" year="2013">It's a beautiful song which I learned in my childhood, that is somewhere in the early 1950s. Thanks.</article>
	<article author="Margaret Olusolape Jemilugba" email="mjemilugba@yahoo.com" city="Akure" provst="Ondo" country="Nigeria" month="8" day="7" year="2013">"Life at best is very brief" I remember this song tonight as I ponder over the sudden call to glory of Brother Peter Yidawi, the General Secretary of Fellowship of Christian Nurses, Nigeria. I sang this song as a member of the Joint Campus Choir in the university in the 70s during mission outreach at beginning of new sessions during altar calls. Very heart rendering! Thank God I got all the stanzas on the Internet and I sang as in the days of old. Lord keep me faithful till the end!</article>
	<article author="Crimson Jebakumar" email="crimsonjebakumar@gmail.com" city="Nagercoil" provst="Tamil Nadu" country="India" month="7" day="1" year="2013">In June 1978, a gospel meeting was arranged in the TB hospital, Asaripallam, Nagercoil. I was a young boy, watching my father playing the organ and the drummer. Bro. Antipas preached the word of God and this was the core song of the sermon and he preached on the vanity of life on earth but the eternal salvation through Jesus Christ.  I have seen many TB patients accepted Jesus as their Saviour. Many would have died later but one day we can meet in the Lord's presence.  This song was sung twice in the beginning and the end and it was so touching. Caleb Annan's voice was superb at that time.</article>
	<article author="Olufemi Omole" email="omolerocky@yahoo.com" city="Kano" provst="" country="Nigeria" month="6" day="14" year="2013">I first sang this song over 30 years ago, it came to my mind now and searching the Internet found it with piano accompaniment. The song really challenged me as a Christian and expectations of life after. I pray sincerely to be in time while the voice of Jesus calls.</article>
	<article author="Yinka" email="yinka.akinbami@gmail.com" city="Lagos" provst="" country="Nigeria" month="5" day="6" year="2013">I just woke up from a dream where I was in a congregation singing this hymn. I sang it first in my secondary school as a young convert in 1971. I was 12 going on 13 then. Now in my 54th year to be 55 in a few months I appreciate God's mercy and grace that saved me. Such a lovely song deep in my subconscious as I haven't sung it in years. Now just waking from that dream and searching out the song on the Internet and discovering this instrumental accompaniment moves me to tears. Thank You Lord Jesus for saving me.</article>
	<article author="Lisa" email="lisamallum@yahoo.com" city="Abuja" provst="FCT" country="Nigeria" month="4" day="5" year="2013">First heard the hymn in 1992, when I was 5, it happened to be Dad's favourite. He stays awake all night playing and keeping it on re-play, then sits us down to explain the words the next morning. Guess I was too young to comprehend the meaning, but now that I'm 26, I'm pushed to tears when I finally sang it word for word last night. God bless His church and saints. AMEN.</article>
	<article author="Ken Rystead" email="" city="Delta" provst="B.C." country="Canada" month="6" day="3" year="2012">I first heard this hymn at The wst Richmond Gospel Hall in 1973 when was newly saved.
It tells it all. Be in time is the message and that means, NOW.
It is my favourite gospel hymn and as my beest friend Wayne Guindon says, it is the best hymn I ever heard in my whole life.</article>
	<article author="Oghale Olugua" email="" city="Emede" provst="Delta" country="Nigeria" month="1" day="13" year="2012">I heard this song in 1971 as we learnt it in the Choir at the Evangelical Christian Union of the University of Benin, Benin city, Nigeria; under Sister NWAKA MBA. I have been blessed with its timeless TRUTH of responding to GOD'S CALL whenever we hear GOD'S VOICE, audibly or as a STILL SMALL VOICE. Indecision, delay or rejection is suicidal. So, my humble plea to anyone hearing these words is: BE IN TIME. For, the sweet nothingness of life is so insignificantly brief in comparison to the JOY of ETERNITY with GOD.</article>
	<article author="Happy Wilson Abali" email="" city="Port Harcourt" provst="Rivers" country="Nigeria" month="11" day="9" year="2011">Reminds me why it is important to obey God rather man. Remaining on God's side and being obedient to ALL His requirements is the best one can ever do in his life. "There is" the Bible says "no repentance in the grave."</article>

	<article author="Onovo-Agbo David" email="" city="Aba" provst="Abia State" country="Nigeria" month="10" day="13" year="2011">I'd say I've always known this hymn all my life. But sometime in the late 90s, our song book was changed with a new one which hadn't this hymn on it. Surprisingly, my mind would race back to these lines again this morning as I gave deep thoughts to my friends and relations departed. It beckons on sinners to the mercy seat and His saving grace: whilst also warning of the iminent damnation that awaits a recalcitrant soul. Such a great hymn I love so much!</article>
	<article author="Martin Adu" email="" city="Leiden" provst="Zuid Holland" country="Netherlands" month="9" day="3" year="2011">I knew this song way back in the early 80s while in a campus Christian fellowship. We sang it in choir to invite people to the altar for Jesus. It's words are so direct, imploring, encouraging, directing the sinner to Jesus. It just came in my head and I got searching and fount it here. I am so blessed and reminded of what life is all about, it's brevity and how we should seek, find and live for the Lord.</article>
	<article author="Dorothy Burks" email="" city="Covington" provst="TN" country="United States" month="1" day="1" year="2011">Lyrics by Bishop Charles Harrison Mason, Founder of Churches of God in Christ, Inc. I heard the lyrics for the first time from a cd of his funeral (about 1961) and I couldn't wait to get the music. Most enjoyable!!!!!!</article>
	<article author="Joshua Kim" email="" city="Newport" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="10" day="12" year="2008">This is in the Korean hymnal (most Korean churches use the same hymnal). Although the Korean translation is fine, these original English words hit much closer to heart. I can imagine this being used to great effect in a revival meeting.</article>
	<article author="Simon Garratt" email="" city="" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="7" day="1" year="2008">A hymn that I grew up with, that I often use and quote. A hymn that I love because its words are true.
