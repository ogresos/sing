Stanza after stanza stirred her heart, but when the choir came to the final line, "Here, Lord I give myself away," she gave herself away to the Lord as well. That blind woman was Fanny Crosby. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown and Norton</article>
    <article author="Godwin Etti" email="" city="Surrey" provst="BC" country="Canada" month="3" day="11" year="2011">I just want to appreciate Robert Wood's comments above. In all of our inquisitions in regards to our low spiritual tide, there isn't any thing else, in my opinion, that erodes our usefulness in the hands of God like having some hidden elevated self views. But when we truly come to grip with our total unworthiness then will be glory come down. The great apostle Paul exclaimed " For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing ..." (Rom. 7:18). As mentioned in my comment above, it is this decietful self elevation that has cancelled kneeling down to pray in many Christian forum of worship. In as much as God is, in fact, not particular about our prayer postures, a time comes nevertheless in our lives that as the great prophet Daniel we "kneel" before this Great God of Heaven. May God help us to come to terms with our exalted position IN Christ and and not our earthly self-elevated views. Amen.</article>
    <article author="Robert Wood" email="" city="Las Vegas" provst="Nevada" country="United States" month="6" day="4" year="2010">Thank you for posting this the way Issac Watts wrote it. I see many hymnals that replace "worm" with "sinner", I guess because it seems less debasing. But until we see our total unworthiness we will never fully understand what Christ did. May my prayer always be "Dissolve my heart in thankfulness, 
And melt mine eyes to tears."</article>
