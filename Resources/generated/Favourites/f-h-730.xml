	<article author="Sharon Torgerson" email="gstorgerson@gmail.com" city="Damascus" provst="OR" country="United States" month="3" day="10" year="2016">I'm delighted to see this wonderful old hymn melody connected to Annie Johnson Flint's poem. Just discovered this today as I was going to find her poem again - it's a difficult week in my world, and I often find that her accurate portrayal of the Spirit's work in us as He disciplines and encourages us to stand, and learn, and rest-in-the-midst - yes, her portrayal of that encourages me. Beautiful musical selection to go with it - thank you.</article>

I am moved to tears to find the loving comments of so many lovers of Christ across the world. Your love for Him and others makes this beautiful song resound and resound across all of creation. Surely our trials press us closer to Him and then He in His goodness presses us in love to each other.</article>
