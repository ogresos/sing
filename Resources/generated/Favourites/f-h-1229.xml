	<article author="Asahi" email="" city="" provst="NJ" country="United States" month="8" day="25" year="2011">I am touched by this song so much! Eph. 5:25: Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her...that He might present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things, but she would be holy and without blemish.
This song and the verses above brings me into the inner part of His affection, brings me into an untold intimate relationship with Him. Oh, my dearest Lord, I love You! May Your heart's desire being fulfilled soon!</article>

His viewpoint is higher and deeper, richer and purer than any seeing or recognition I could possibly have from myself alone.  What a wonder that a mere hymn could convey such great sentiment and tender mental reflection into my own small heart.</article>
