    <article author="Lynn Derrick" email="llynnderrick@austin.rr.com" city="San Marcos" provst="TX" country="United States" month="10" day="4" year="2013">I had printed out this song to sing in our home meeting, not even noticing that it had been so extensively reworked. We were all so pleasantly surprised when it came time to sing it. What a faithful update to a song that had such an equally shining beginning.

The content has really been brought up to match the high peak of the divine revelation, and it not only serves to bring the singers into the reality of the content, but it also brings the reality of the content, the Triune God Himself, into the singers, strengthening the mutual abode!</article>
