Amazing!
Glory be to God!
I love you guys, I appreciate you... for posting this hymnal along with the lyrics (notes/etc) and the piano/guitar were great accompaniment. Since my guitar was in bad shape. I miss it....
Thank you so much! May God bless you in return! Love, Grace
P.S. My friends were afraid to sing this song because they said that its a death/funeral song. But not so for us true believers in Christ, Philippians 1:21 For me to live is Christ and to die is gain. HalleluYAH!</article>

I was thinking about these times entering closer nearer when life's "little" difficulties press in. The comments are lovely. I did not know what hymn was played on the Titanic. I do not know why I fear approaching Him, the exposing light, because each time; {{"His presence of love comforts, strengthens and brings hope"}]</article>
	<article author="Frank Pytel" email="fpytel@sbcglobal.net" city="Chicago" provst="Illinois" country="United States" month="8" day="17" year="2014">As I draw near to God, He draws near to me. There is a nearness that every believer has with Him day by day, but when "the sun goes down, and darkness comes over me" there is a nearness of God that is.... I don't know the word. His nearness with His presence of light exposes me, but at the same time, His nearness with His presence of love comforts, strengthens and brings hope with dreams of His will in Christ.</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="2" day="27" year="2014">In the Johnstown City flood of 1889, a train rushed into the swirling water. A woman on her way to be a missionary was caught in a doomed rail car. She began singing this song and was joined by helpless rescuers on shore as they saw her swept away to her death in the flood. - Songs of the Spirit by Martin</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="9" day="20" year="2013">Sarah Adams' mother died when she was only 5. At 32, as an actress playing Lady Macbeth in London's Richmond Theater, she said farewell to the stage. She wanted to continue, but her health was failing. The health of her sister was also poor, and Adams feared the day when she would have to bid her farewell. She began to question her faith. Why did God seem so far away?
When Adams' pastor asked her and her sister to help him prepare a hymnal, the two responded eagerly, writing 13 texts and 62 new tunes. As the sisters were finishing their work, their pastor mentioned that he was planning a sermon about Jacob's dream of a ladder ascending to heaven and he needed an appropriate hymn. Adams soon completed the 5 stanzas of "Nearer, My God, to Thee." - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton
----------------------------
The 1st 2 lines of stanza 3 in the original are:
Then let the way the way appear
steps unto heav'n
-------------------------
The 5th stanza is:
Or if on joyful wing,
cleaving the sky,
Sun, moon, and stars forgot,
upward I fly.
Still all my song shall be
nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer, my God to Thee,
nearer to Thee.
