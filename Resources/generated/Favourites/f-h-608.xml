	<article author="R. B." email="" city="" provst="Oregon" country="United States" month="6" day="29" year="2012">It is not just my Father God who loves me and justifies me in the Son and gives me the Spirit in my heart, but the entire, mysteriously wonderful, flowing and dispensing Triune God has flowed out of eternity into time and into me, and this complete, inseparable Triune God now dwells in me, in my spirit and has made Himself one spirit with me (as well as every genuine believer)! He is three, yet He is ever one! He is three to impart Himself into us, and He as One is in us for eternity. He is forever three and He is forever one. He is now one spirit with us wanting to spread into all of our being, beginning with our mind, emotion and will. May He indeed be our all in all for eternity!</article>
	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="5" day="12" year="2012">The Spirit is the transfiguration of Christ. In resurrection Christ was transfigured from the flesh into the Spirit. Hence, the Spirit is Christ in another form. We can use the example of raw rice being boiled and becoming cooked rice. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three persons, and although the three are distinct, They are not separate but are one intrinsically. This mysterious God is described in a hymn: "In person three, in substance all are one" (Hymns, #608). Christ is God, and Christ is the Spirit. God is embodied in Christ, and Christ was transfigured in order to enter into us as the Spirit. We should be clear that the Spirit is the transfiguration of Christ.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="5" day="16" year="2008">To know the hymns we have to know some of the crucial points of the contents of the hymns. First, we must know some of the hymns on the blessing and experience of the Triune God. The word blessing is used here not to refer to the good things the Triune God has given us but to the praise, the blessing, we offer to Him. An example of a good hymn on the blessing of the Triune God is #7—"Glory, glory, to the Father!"—and an example of a good hymn on the experience of the Triune God is #608—"What mystery, the Father, Son, and Spirit." We also need to know hymns in the categories of the praise of the Father and the praise of the Lord.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="4" day="8" year="2008">Our God today is not merely the Creator revealed in Genesis 1:1. He is the processed God, as revealed in Matthew 28:19. Matthew 28:19 is more complicated than Genesis 1:1. Genesis 1:1 simply says that in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. But Matthew 28:19 tells us to baptize people "into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." This verse speaks of the one name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. The name of God here is Father-Son-Spirit. Due to the poverty of our language, we may be forced to use the term "person" in speaking of the Father, Son, and Spirit, referring to Them as the three Persons of the Trinity. We have done this in the opening lines of one of our hymns (Hymns #608):

What mystery, the Father, Son, and Spirit, In person three, in substance all are one.

However, we should not press this term too far, lest we unintentionally endorse the doctrine of tritheism, the belief that the Father, Son, and Spirit are three Gods.  We definitely do not believe in tritheism; we believe in the one true God, whose name, according to Matthew 29:19, is Father-Son-Spirit. This is the processed God into whose name we are to baptize people.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="27" year="2008">"All that the Father has" is truly rich and exceedingly vast! Consider for example His economy, His good pleasure, and His plan. Hymns, #608 has five stanzas: the first stanza concerns the Father, the Son, and the Spirit generally; stanzas 2, 3, and 4 are on the Father, the Son, and the Spirit respectively; and stanza 5 tells of our experience. Stanza 2 says that the Father as the source is rich, that His wealth is inexhaustible, and that He is indeed a treasure-store. All these riches and wealth are actually the "all," which has been given to the Son.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="25" year="2008">The chorus of Hymns, #608 says, "The Triune God has now become our all!" This hymn clearly explains how the Triune God has become our blessed portion and how He is dispensing Himself into us. In Ephesians 3:8 the apostle Paul said, "To me…was this grace given to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel." Here to announce means not only "to preach" but also "to transmit." This means that Paul received a commission from God to transfuse the unsearchable riches of Christ into the Gentiles so that they all would have the Triune God in them. In this way they could become the members of Christ and, aggregately, the Body of Christ (v. 6). The revelation in Ephesians concerning the Body of Christ and the members of Christ is very complete and thorough.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="24" year="2008">Instead of saying, "In person three, in substance all are one," it would be better to say, "In substance three, in essence all are one." We may say that God has three substances, but only one essence. In the three substances of the divine Trinity, the Holy Spirit, or the Spirit of God, is the third one. He is the consummated One, and this consummated One is the consummation of the Triune God. When the Triune God was consummated, He was revealed in the way that we who believe into Christ can be baptized into Him. This indicates that we, the believers of Christ, can have an organic union with the consummated Triune God.
