The Lord keeps us safe and reminds us not to be afraid of troubles, but to remember He is the most high and he keeps us safe. Jesus is all, and He is mine!!!</article>

The words of this hymn have ministered to me in times of great distress and temptations to fear. Whatever problem arises, Jesus Christ is the solution!</article>
