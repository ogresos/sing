And if the devil doesn't like he can sit on a tack
sit on a tack 
sit on a tack
and if the devil doesn't like he can sit on a tack
sit on a tack 
sit on a tack today
and as kids we would stand up and sing this song and we we go to this part we would sit in the seat and say ouch! and stand back up we had a lot of fun with this old song.</article>

Down in my heart
Down in my heart
Down in my heart
I have the love of Jesus Christ my saviour 
Down in my heart
Down in my heart to stay
I have a peace that passes understanding 
Down in my heart
Down in my heart
Down in my heart
I have a peace that passes understanding 
Down in my heart
Down in my heart to stay.
I have the wonderful love of my blessed redeemer
Down in my heart....and so on.</article>

	<article author="Agnes" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="11" day="18" year="2013">I am not surprised that David while singing for the Lord was dancing as well. When we sing the above song with children it is impossible not to dance or at least do some motion. Try it yourselves.</article>
