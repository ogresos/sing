	<article author="Isaac Kojo Ansah" email="kojoansah2002@yahoo.com" city="Bergen" provst="Hordaland" country="Norway" month="6" day="23" year="2016">From the first stanza to the last of this hymn reveals the greatness of God, what the Almighty can do for those who diligently seek him.
In times of difficulty we turn to lose our hope, but the 4th stanza tells us to " Ponder anew, What the Almighty can do, Who with His love doth befriend thee." 
I love this hymn.</article>

4b Praise to the Lord, who, when tempests 
   their warfare are waging,
 Who, when the elements 
   madly around thee are raging,
Biddeth them cease, 
turneth their fury to peace,
Whirlwinds and waters assuaging.
------------
4c Praise to the Lord, who, when darkness 
  of sin is abounding,
Who, when the Godless do triumph, 
  all virtue confounding,
Sheddeth His light, 
chaseth the horrors of night,
Saints with His mercy surrounding.</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="8" day="11" year="2013">As a [theology] student in Bremen, Germany, Joachim Neander lived a Godless life. Then, when Neander was 20, a preacher named Under-Eyke came to Bremen and Neander was converted.
Four years later he became headmaster of a school in Dusseldorf, and during his time there he wrote more than 60 hymns. Because of his strong Christian views and his evangelistic activities [and his popularity with the common people - Wikepedia], he displeased the authorities and was eventually removed from his position. 
Despite the tensions, he wrote many hymns of praise. He often wandered through the valleys and hills near Dusseldorf, communing with his Lord. After losing his position at the school, he lived for a time in a cave and continued to write hymns. He died very young at the age of 30, but he left behind him a legacy of praise to God. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton
-------------------
While living in Dusseldorf, he liked to go to the nearby valley of the Düssel river, nature being the inspiration for his poems. He also held gatherings and services in the valley, at which he gave sermons. The Neandertal (German thal for valley, modernized to tal) was renamed in his honor in the early 19th century, and became famous in 1856 when the remains of the Homo neanderthalensis (Neanderthal Man) were found there. - Wikipedia</article>
