    <article author="Larry" email="" city="Lagos" provst="Lagos" country="Nigeria" month="1" day="28" year="2011">This hymn is making me shed tears each time I listen to it. I wasted many many years in my youth. But listening to it gives me a true sense of God's forgiveness now that am in Christ Jesus my Saviour. I now believe that all my sins have been taken care of on the Cross of Calvary. I make effort, each day, to bring this message to young people I come across. Blessed be the name of the Lord God Almighty, in Jesus name. Amen.</article>
