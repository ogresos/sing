  願你為大，哦主耶穌！
  信條、話語、虛儀、
  屬人的會、屬世的愛，
  不能與你相比。

2. 願你為大，哦主耶穌！
你愛征服了我；
靠你十架我向己死，
完全為你而活。

3. 願你為大，哦主耶穌！
全人被你充滿，
使我思想像你思想，
喜歡像你喜歡。

4. 願你為大，哦主耶穌！
把我改變全備；
從這幔子（軟弱肉體）
顯出你的榮美。

5. 願你為大，哦主耶穌！
我心真是要求：
作你奴隸，行你旨意，
一生不再自由。</article>

	<article author="John Chao" email="" city="Toronto" provst="ON" country="Canada" month="8" day="20" year="2002">Throughout this summer, the Lord has done many wondrous things... and one was the revival of the young people. I feel so drawn by the Lord that I have a desire to burn for Him. However, like many other times, after a while our self becomes our boss again and our temperature for the Lord drops.

That's why I've enjoyed Hymn 367 so much. We have a new tune for it and so we changed the first verse to the chorus and had the rest as the verses.

What's so wonderful about this song is that it shows us the whole process of our Christian life. First and foremost, we need to make Him supreme above all things and then His love will conquer us. We then will learn to take our self to the cross and live alone to Him. Then when our heart is emptied of all self-ambition and vainglory, He can fill our inmost being. And then we can take this mind, the mind that was also in Christ Jesus. Then His life will transfigure ours and we can take and live His life instead of ours. Then when we've given our all to the Lord, our soul will exult because we are finally what we were made for: to be His slave and do His will. This will be our felicity.</article>
