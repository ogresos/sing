I never knew the other lines and I am thrilled to learn them. I learned the song at Bible to Youth camp in Union Town, PA . Uncle Davey the camp Director taught it to us. Praise the Lord! I love singing and teaching it.</article>

	<article author="Allan Effa" email="" city="Edmonton" provst="Alberta" country="Canada" month="10" day="23" year="2012">This was a favourite of mine about 50 years ago as well. I am now doing research and writing on ecotheology and a number of theologians stress the fact that all of creation praises God just by being what it is, a witness to God's creativity. Whenever we worship, we are joining our voices to an unceasing universal praise. Indeed, this little chorus sums up this profound idea in such a simple way!</article>
