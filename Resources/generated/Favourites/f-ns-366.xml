Lord Jesus, by myself I cannot please You. Lord Jesus, feel free to make home in my heart, occupy and posses my whole being until You'll be magnified in me.</article>

	<article author="Anna Salazar" email="annas12cali@hotmail.com" city="Irvine" provst="CA" country="United States" month="3" day="13" year="2016">I love the progression in this hymn. "Little willingness" becomes "I say yes and give You full permission" and "'Tis my joy to give You all the ground."

Thank You, Lord, for being the One who can capture my heart and my being in such a way! Lord, You are so lovely! I love You, my Beloved!</article>

I want You to be at home within me."</article>

We'd like to be wholly consecrated to you but are not willing to lay all on the altar. But Lord we have You as the absolute One in our being who can break through all the barriers until every corner of our heart is fully Your home. Lord Jesus do it for Your satisfaction and rest. AMEN.</article>

	<article author="Bukky" email="" city="Abuja" provst="" country="Nigeria" month="12" day="30" year="2011">This song helps me to express my desire and prayer for 2012. Even though there may be little willingness within me, I say yes and give You full permission, Lord. Touch every corner of my heart. Don't let me withhold any part, break every barrier or resistance to Your will in my life. Don't let me be self-seeking, Lord; but do all things for Your glory and honour. I want to be wholly consecrated to Thee, not in word alone but that all my being would be fully given to Thee, in Jesus name. Amen.
May God bless the writer of this song.</article>

	<article author="Sister In Christ" email="" city="Quezon City" provst="" country="Philippines" month="12" day="13" year="2011">Amen!! Lord cause us to absolutely surrender ourselves to You not in words alone but in all our being. Indeed, Lord, You are the only One who offered Yourself without reluctance unto God.

Lord, You're dwelling in our spirit; moving, spreading outward day by day.
There's a whisper of Amen within us in response to all that You would say.

Lord we give You the ground to work in us, to touch every corner of our hearts, to break through us until we are completely dependent and absolute to You. Until You make Your home in our hearts. 

Lord, we love You. Thank You!!</article>
