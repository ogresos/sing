What an awesome way to prepare for prayer and warfare.</article>

    <article author="Janet Chang" email="" city="" provst="" country="Singapore" month="1" day="9" year="2003">Set your mind on the things which are above, not on the things which are on earth! (Col. 3:1)

Setting my mind on my spirit or on the things which are above applies alot to me!

I often have lots of difficulty on setting my mind on the spirit! But I'm glad the Lord gave us the Body of Christ. All the saints are there supporting and we have the Lord there too always for us! I really love this Body that the Lord has given me! I treasure each and every one of them very much! I believe even though I still have difficulty on setting my mind on the spirit, I can make it one day with the help of the Lord and all the saints!

Dear saints, may we continue to pursue and enjoy the Lord everyday in our daily living!</article>
