It never ceases to amaze me what God uses these old hymns to do in my life. This particular one I was singing in my sleep 2 days ago.  I know that the Lord is assuring me of victory in the midst of foes.  All I have to do is pick up my God given weapons and fight to enforce the victory already won for me by Christ Jesus. Glory be to His name! All my enemies are under my feet in Jesus name. Amen! Alleluia!</article>
