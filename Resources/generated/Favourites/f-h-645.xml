Difficult week, wasted precious time and opportunity. Yesterday; "Lord Jesus, what is wrong with me? Why do I not keep my eye on You, Your heart's yearnings. How can I forget the only safe place is through / in You --- and You went to the cross." Light began to sneak into my gray soul. 
A sister texted me a quote from this hymn today.  Scanned some of the comments here. The scriptures referenced so stabilizing.  Someone said, "Make this your anthem today."</article>

	<article author="Cliff Hahn" email="cliff@mytexasrealestate.com" city="Cedar Park" provst="Texas" country="United States" month="7" day="4" year="2016">Praise be to God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit. God through His Son will gather you up and hold you so no harm becomes of you. This song is a song of the heart and soul, a saving and wonderful Blessing.
In times of trouble and deceit, we who are His children must trust on the firm foundation of our Savior, Jesus.
Your treasures are NOT of this world. True peace and happiness are only found through trust in the Lord and waiting for the Lord to work his will through us.
This song, as short as it is, will lift you up and carry you to a higher place, away from this world and to the saving light of the Father.
Amen.</article>

We ought always to turn our eyes upon Jesus because He is our only hope in whatever situation we face in life.
What a blessed thing it is to be SAVED and know for sure that we have a place in Heaven for all Eternity. More than half of the world has rejected the Saviour who died for their sins on that cruel Cross at Calvary.
Praise be to God and all honour and Glory are His for all eternity. Amen.</article>

BIBLE MEDITATION:
“And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.” Mk 11:22
 
DEVOTIONAL THOUGHT:
I ask some Christians, “How are you doing?” They say, “Okay—under the circumstances.” How did you ever get there?
 
Circumstances are like a mattress. You’re supposed to be on it, not under it. Under the circumstances, you suffocate; on them you rest pretty well.
 
The only way you can run the race is to take your eyes off things or people around you and look to Jesus. He’s the author of the race. He’s the goal to which you run. If you look to Jesus to supply your every need for the race, you’ll find faith growing in your heart and in your life. You see, it’s not great faith in God; it is faith in a great God.
 
ACTION POINT:
Do you have a hymnal in your home? Find the hymn “Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus” by Helen Lemmel and make it your anthem today!</article>

	<article author="Rachel" email="puppyluv904@hotmail.com" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="2" day="5" year="2016">All these Jesus loving, spirit filled hearts worshipping together in a comment section of all places. God brought so many of His children here to worship Him and leave little pieces of their hearts and journey with God for others to see, glorifying and magnifying the Lord with joy! Just scrolling through this has reminded me of God's loving nature and how He places such joy in people's hearts through worshipping Him. God is so good!!! Constantly He reminds me all I need to do is look back at Him and everything is ok, so I'm thanking God for His work in all of those who sing these words and for Him speaking through them. Glory be God's!</article>

	<article author="Leon Estes" email="" city="Lowell" provst="Arkansas" country="United States" month="3" day="31" year="2012">I have enjoyed this hymn for many years. If I may, here is some background on this hymn: 
  The author and composer of this hymn, Helen H Lemmel, relates that one day, in 1918, a missionary friend gave her a tract entitled "Focused." 
  The pamphlet contained these words - - -
 "So then, turn your eyes upon Him, look full into His face and you will find that the things of earth will acquire a strange new dimness." 
  These words made a deep impression upon her. She could not dismiss them from her mind. She recalls this experience following the reading of that tract:  "Suddenly, as if commanded to stop and listen, I stood still, and singing in my soul and spirit was the Chorus, with not one conscious moment of putting word to word to make rhyme, or note to note to make melody. The verses were written the same week, after the usual manner of composition, but none the less dictated by the Holy Spirit." 
-Adapted from Kenneth Osbeck</article>

And as I see the Lord more as my Friend and Companion, I realize that all the worries and troubles I have, everything I go through, the Lord is there with me. I just have to turn to Him and enjoy Him! And my burdens will be carried for me! That I can gain more of Him!</article>

I am taking medication but I feel that I am not getting healed and my health will never be the same again. I knew this was the Lord's chastisement. The Lord wanted me to come back to Him. Upon the Lord's mercy, I heeded His call and He led me out of darkness and into His light again. Yesterday my sister told me that she has been enjoying this hymn in the last 2 weeks. I looked it up in the hymnal and it is hymn #645. Thank the Lord for giving me this hymn. It serves as a great reminder that I must constantly turn my eyes upon Jesus and let Jesus take over all my health problems. Hallelujah!

Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus

1. O soul are you and weary troubled? No light in the darkness you see? There's light for a look at the Savior, And life more abundant and free!

Turn your eyes upon 
Jesus, Look full in His wonderful face; And the things of this earth will grow strangely dim In the light of His glory and grace.

2. Through death into life everlasting He past and we follow Him there; Over us sin no more hath dominion, For more than conquerors we are!

3. His word shall not fail you He promised; Believe him and all will be well: Then go to the world that is dying, His perfect salvation to tell!</article>

This song was the one thing that kept me going and it would calm me.

Especially when I would get scared he would go to prison for a very long time.

When I sang it to myself, God would calm my fears.

Everything came out A OKAY with God's help.</article>
	<article author="Daniel Jackson" email="" city="Reading" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="3" day="4" year="2003">At first glance, I would probably consider this hymn to be a bit shallow or short of truth, but lately the Lord has blessed me with some experience of the chorus.

"Turn your eyes upon Jesus,
Look full in His wonderful face,
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim,
In the light of His glory and grace."

So often, my only focus is on my own situation, my own fears and concerns. I am totally selfish. I even refuse to turn to the Lord. However, this evening, the Lord was bothering me with the words of this chorus. I just need to turn my eyes on Him! What's important is not what is good for me, or what I want. The Lord has a desire. He wants to gain us fully, and this is done practically by our turning to Him. I want Him to be satisfied. Oh, may He keep us focused on Him hour by hour!</article>
