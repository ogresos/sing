I enjoyed it so much! Really we're prisoners in the Lord and we have the real liberty in Him. 
"Well pleased a prisoner to be,
Because, my God, it pleaseth Thee".
This lines remembered me a verse that says: "I love my master, […] I will not go out free". (Exodus 21:5, King James Version)
How good is to be a prisoner in the Lord! Amen!</article>

	<article author="Anthony Campbell" email="" city="Huntington Beach" provst="CA" country="United States" month="1" day="31" year="2015">This is an amazing hymn, and I particularly enjoyed this line, "Well pleased a prisoner to be". We need to be those who have this loving relationship with the Lord, one where we are so captured by Him, that being removed from the world becomes a trivial thing when compared to being with our loving Captor.</article>

	<article author="Joy" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="6" day="10" year="2013">We may sometimes feel that to be "caged" in the Lord is a great limitation. But if the Lord has mercy on us, we will soon discover that this "cage" is actually a vast, exhaustless land flowing with milk and honey for our rest and satisfaction. "Oh to lie forever here; / Doubt and care and self resign / While He whispers in my ear, / "I am His and He is mine."</article>

	<article author="Jessica" email="" city="Diamond Bar" provst="California" country="United States" month="2" day="18" year="2009">This hymn is very true. Sometimes our world is very cruel. This also includes our daily situations...sometimes we just feel that we are stuck in a cage nowhere to go, but remember we have the Lord! Call on Him! Even in that cage, through all our troubles and hardships... we can still turn to Him!
HAVE FAITH IN HIM SAINTS....!</article>

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="31" year="2008">Young people, no matter how long your trial may be, do not be disappointed. You need to recognize that your trial is of God. No one can be enthroned without being tried and tested. Although we like to be enthroned immediately, God would say, "The time is not yet. Do not talk to Me about enthronement. You need to be put into the dungeon." If you seek the Lord, the Lord will put you into a dungeon. Perhaps all who are around you—your wife, your children, the elders, and the brothers and sisters—intend to respect you; however, whatever they do only serves to put you into a dungeon. We have nothing to say about this. Without the dungeon, we cannot ascend to the throne. Do not be a dungeon dropout; stay in the dungeon until you graduate and receive the crown. You need the last two years.

Although I may have no intention of putting you in a dungeon and although you may have no intention of putting me in a dungeon, what actually happens is that we put one another into a dungeon. When you were married, did you intend to put your wife into a dungeon? Surely you had no such intention. But this is just what you have done. Unintentionally and unconsciously, we put others into a dungeon. My children have done this to me. Sometimes they tell me how much they love me, but within myself I say, "Your love puts me into a dungeon." Nevertheless, we need to say, "Hallelujah for the dungeon! Although I have been here for ten years, I need to stay another two years." Again I say, do not drop out of the dungeon. Stay there and stay there gloriously, with praises to the Lord, not with the gnashing of teeth.

Madame Guyon was one who could praise the Lord in her dungeon. She even wrote a poem in which she likened herself to a bird in a cage. Here is the first stanza:

A little bird I am,
Shut from the fields of air,
And in my cage I sit and sing
To Him who placed me there;
Well pleased a prisoner to be,
Because, my God, it pleaseth Thee.

Madame Guyon grew to love her cage, which was her dungeon.
