    <article author="Hymnal.Net" month="3" day="26" year="2008">Thank the Lord. Those who have faith do not need to pray. Those who have faith are full of praises. Never say that prayer is a sign of faith. Please remember that, on the contrary, prayer is a sign of lack of faith. All experienced Christians know that where there is faith, there is praise. One hymn [Hymns, #690] says:

Hear the message from the throne,
Claim the promise, doubting one;
God hath spoken, "It is done."
Faith has answered, "It is done."
Prayer is over, praise begun.
Hallelujah, "It is done."

You cannot say, "It will be done." All those who say it will be done do not have faith. God said that everything is done. You also must say that everything is done. God said that He has accomplished everything, and I believe in this. This is all that matters.
