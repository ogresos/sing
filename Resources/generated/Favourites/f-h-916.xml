The Polhills were missionaries to China and later Tibet with the China Inland Mission started by Hudson Taylor. Annie also wrote, "The Great Closed Land: A Plea for Tibet", "The children of China: written for the children of England", "The children of India, written for the children of England by one of their friends" and "The children of Africa for all English-Speaking children". All her hymns were written for Keswick Conventions.

In 1908 Cecil Polhill visited Azusa Street, Los Angeles, where he had a Pentecostal experience. Before returning to England Polhill wrote a cheque for Â£1500 to pay off the mortgage on the Azusa Street building. After returning to England Polhill attended Alexander Boddy's first Sunderland Convention, and helped Boddy fund his Pentecostal periodical, "Confidence". Polhill became the first President of the Pentecostal Missionary Union, and administered it along China Inland Mission lines. In 1925 the Executive Council of the PMU voted to merge with the British Assemblies of God, and so Polhill, an Anglican, resigned aged 65. He maintained friendly relationships with the PMU, and missionaries in the field. - Wikipedia</article>
