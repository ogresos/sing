So, starting from now on I can see there's a vision or a sign that Christ is here! Our Bridegroom is here yet He wanted to dwell in us. OH! such a wonderful story I've ever heard. From now on I cannot forget whenever I'm down I have to move forward to the Lord my God. I'm glad to know the Lord since young. I'll never forget that Christ is in me Always! HALLELUJAH!</article>
