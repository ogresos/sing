One of the best books I have ever read. Amy started by discipling the destitute shawlee women of the Irish slums and lived like they did to prove that one could serve the Lord in their situations. In the midst of a very fruitful work, she felt the call to bring the gospel to foreign lands, and left the Irish work in the hands of her able disciples. Though rejected by the China Inland mission because of her health, she persevered and went to Japan, where she challenged accepted limitations and was fruitful, but had to be sent home due to health after a short time. A friend wrote her that the climate in Bangalore, India would do her well, so she left another fruitful work in Ireland for India. In India, she was appalled at the fruitlessness of the missionaries and their satisfaction with the status quo. She broke rank with them and produced remaining fruit. She had saved so many children from being dedicated to a life as a temple prostitute. When she passed, she asked that no marker be put on her grave. The people obeyed her request except that they put a birdbath on her grave with only the Indian word, "Amma", meaning "mother" on it. This brought me to tears and to cry out loud, which I rarely do.</article>
