Jesus met all the needs of the people in the long ago, and continues to meet our needs today as we think of Him. He is the one who makes the living word so lively and quickening. This song came to my mind the other day as I was contemplating a very tedious job I knew was coming. But, I only remembered the title of the hymn and forgot that the real tedium comes from losing sight of Jesus. Everything else is doable with Him. With our Shepherd who carries His lambs in His arms we might be cast down but not destroyed, persecuted but not forsaken, troubled on every side but not distressed. No other religion offers the help that the Lord gives to the creatures that came from His hand. He knows what we need--love, tough and soft. That's what Jesus brought back to the world. We love Him because He first loved us--to the end.</article>
