	<article author="李 菲 麗" email="" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="7" day="8" year="2011">This morning, I read and enjoy--The Four Crucial Elements of the Bible-Christ, the Spirit, Life and the Church, chapter 9. I am greatly impressed with what Bro. Lee shared regarding this hymn:
In the table of contents of our hymnal there is a category called “The Church.” It covers the church as the mystery of Christ, the increase of Christ, the fullness of Christ, the vessel of Christ, and the lampstand of Christ. It also covers the church’s general definition, course, faith, unity, foundation, building, attraction, coordination, and fellowship. Hymns, #824 is on the general definition of the church, whereas #852 is on the attraction of the church. Perhaps many of us have been in the church life for a number of years, yet we are still not clear about the definition of the church, nor do we know what kind of price we need to pay when we are attracted by the church. These two hymns reveal to us these two aspects of the truth. I hope that we all can earnestly study the truths contained in our hymns.</article>
