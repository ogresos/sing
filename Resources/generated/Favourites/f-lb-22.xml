Thank You for finding us with Your love, O Your redeeming love that brought us to the flock, and Your recovering love that brought us back when we fell to the pigs' pen!
O brothers and sisters, may we see that the Lord Jesus sought us to lead us back to the flock for the fulfillment of His economy. May this be our goal in life, everything is just for God's economy. There is no greater love than what the Lord has given us.</article>

    <article author="Isaiah Tor" city="Sydney" provst="" country="" month="8" day="12" year="2009">This hymn is so sweet as it in stark definitive terms describes the burden and operation of the Triune God in reaching us, shepherding us and embracing us. We need such a realization that the operation of the Triune God is entirely towards and within us as sinners in receiving His gospel. We must marvel at such an operation, such a shepherding that is so powerful yet so intimate, so mysterious, yet so immediate and available in our deep subjective experiences. And it follows from this hymn, echoing Luke 15, that we also must be joined with the Triune God in spirit (Eph. 4:3-6), to have this same unceasing burden (1 Cor.9:16-17) that in the Body we may function according to the Triune God (12:4-6) for the deep burden of gaining sinners through the gospel of God for the Triune God.</article>
