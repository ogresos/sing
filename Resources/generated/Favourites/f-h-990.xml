The last 2 lines of stanza 2 originally say:
Go on your way in peace to Heav’n,
 And wear a crown with Jesus.

There are 2 additional stanzas following stanza 3 above:
4. The children, too, both great and small,
 Who love the name of Jesus,
 May now accept the gracious call
 To work and live for Jesus.
------------------------
5. Come, brethren, help me sing His praise,
 Oh, praise the name of Jesus;
 Oh, sisters, all your voices raise,
 Oh, bless the name of Jesus.
---------------------
There is an additional last stanza:
7. And when to that bright world above,
 We rise to see our Jesus,
 We’ll sing around the throne of love
 His name, the name of Jesus.
-----------------------
The additional stanza posted by Elizabeth on Feb 1, 2014 is a nice one too. It is from the 7th Day Adventist hymnal.</article>
