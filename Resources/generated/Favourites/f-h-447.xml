She was born in Trenton, NJ and died in New York City. 
When she was 13 years old, James began teaching Sunday school in the Methodist Episcopal church. She became a prominent figure in the Wesleyan Holiness movement, assisting Phoebe Palmer, and often leading meetings at Ocean Grove, New Jersey, and elsewhere. 
James wrote the words of this song at the National Camp Meeting in Round Lake, New York, and they appeared in "Notes of Joy for the Sabbath School, the Social Meeting and the Hour of Prayer", by Phoebe Knapp.
She wrote about 50 hymns, and articles by her appeared in the Guide to Holiness, the New York Christian Advocate, The Contributor, The Christian Witness, The Christian Woman, The Christian Standard, and the Ocean Grove Record. Her works include: The Soul Winner: A Sketch of Life and Fact and Incidents in the Life and Labors of Edmund J. Yard. - hymnary
