This is the original hymn by William Stillman Martin, a pastor in Boston and in Florida, (1864-1914). The original already bears this wonderful thought, that Jesus becomes dearer each day, and this is really the sweetness that makes life worth living (v 1 last line).
To Jesus every day I find my heart is closer drawn,
He’s fairer than the glory of the gold and purple dawn;
He’s all my fancy pictures in its fairest dreams, and more,
Each day He grows still sweeter than He was the day before.
Refrain
The half cannot be fancied this side the golden shore;
O there He’ll be still sweeter than He ever was before.
His glory broke upon me when I saw Him from afar,
He’s fairer than the lily, brighter than the morning star;
He fills and satisfies my longing spirit o’er and o’er,
Each day He grows still sweeter than He was the day before.
Refrain
My heart is sometimes heavy, but He comes with sweet relief,
He folds me to His bosom when I droop with blighting grief;
I love the Christ who all my burdens in His body bore,
Each day He grows still sweeter than He was the day before.
