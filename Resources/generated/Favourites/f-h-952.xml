  <article author="steward" city="columbus" provst="North Dakota" country="United States" month="11" day="27" year="2008">Let us keep this hope of the coming of the Lord dearly in all of our heart in these last days of dark apostasy, that is, the falling away from the words of God by the many, who have cast His pure words aside. As the gross darkness of this wicked world increases, and as the raging storms come upon us, let us hold to the hope of the coming of the Lord as a lamp, a shining light to us, to brighten our steps as we persevere to receive our Bridegroom, the Son of Man, when He comes. He will come, and will He find such faith on earth, that is, faith in the hope of His coming, and in the loving of His glorious appearance in all of His dearness, fairness, beauty, majesty and splendor? Yea, let our eyes not eye our garments, but our dear Bridegroom's face as we keep a busy preparing to be ready, as we continually watch and pray.</article>
