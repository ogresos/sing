And before I could settle down to have my quiet time, the Holy Spirit just ministered this song to me and I started singing it. With these comforting words, I know I'm Safe in the arms of Jesus and sweetly my soul doth rest. Almighty God, Your word is yea and amen, it cannot return to You void. I have faith that I am safe in Your arms. No weapon formed against me shall prosper in the awesome name of Jesus.</article>

This is where I am now, praying for a very very dear friend. The Holy Spirit popped this hymn in my heart and I just had to recall every single word in each stanza of the hymn. Now I know God has a word for me for my friend's situation. It is well so I no longer worry. Praise The Lord and His infinite wisdom. Amen.</article>

Many don't. They can be fearful or avoidant. It reminded me of this hymn, Safe in the arms of Jesus. That is our secure attachment! While those we love may leave or pass on, God is our only security.</article>
	<article author="Bisi Bamidele" email="bisidowu@hotmail.com" city="London" provst="Essex" country="United Kingdom" month="8" day="6" year="2014">I was awoken with a heavy burden. I begun to talk to the Lord as l was not able to phone any one as it was rather late—11:15 pm. Furthermore, l was fed up of telling people about my worry, so l decided to pray. To the glory of God the Holy Spirit who is our great Comforter, gave me this profound hymn—Safe in the arms of Jesus. Then, l was given another one—Praise God from whom all blessing flow. Praise Him all creatures here below, Praise Him above ye heavenly host, Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost. From that point my heaviness melted. Praise the Most High. I admonish you to cast all your cares on Jesus, as friends will fail you. But Jesus will never fail.</article>
	<article author="Ben Joshua" email="akanudofia007@gmail.com" city="Calabar" provst="Cross River" country="" month="6" day="17" year="2014">While praying this morning, I was asking the Father why did Jesus come to die for me personally. Though I know generally for humanity from sin but I wanted something more concrete that I could telling my children looking directly Into their eyes with conviction and a sense of who holds my hands in this seeming cool war going on around me. I heard Him say 'I AM THE DOOR'. I Rushed to understand the mystery from the Bible in John 10:1-9, my spirit sprung up with this song 'Safe in the arms of Jesus'. I say a very big thank you to the Spirit behind this song and the humble vessel that yielded to the call. For the owners of this site thanks for being the gatekeepers for God's people.</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="1" day="28" year="2014">This hymn was written in 1869 in New York City. Reportedly, Mr. Doane brought the music to Mrs. Crosby and asked her to write words for it.
"Let me hear it," she said. The blind woman sat attentively listening while he played his composition on a small organ. When he hand finished Mrs. Crosby told him:
"That says we are safe in the arms of Jesus. Let me see what I can do with it." Half an hour later, she was back with the lyrics as we know them more than 100 years hence. - George Beverly Shea in "Songs that Lift the Heart"
--------------------------
The 2nd 1/2 of the 1st stanza in the original says:
Hark! ’tis the voice of angels, 
borne in a song to me.
Over the fields of glory, 
over the jasper sea.
---------------------------
The last line of the chorus originally says:
sweetly my soul shall rest</article>

	<article author="Frederick Ellis" email="freddiejimi@yahoo.com" city="Columbus" provst="Ohio" country="United States" month="9" day="5" year="2013">When you are discourage and tempted and tossed thinking all is lost there came Jesus with His gentle arms to shelter you and caused you to rest in His peace knowing that it's He that sustained us; always remember the foot print in the sand when you don't see it He carries you on His shoulder so that you would soar like an eagle.</article>
	<article author="Soji" email="pastorsoji09@gmail.com" city="Ibadan" provst="Oyo" country="Nigeria" month="8" day="28" year="2013">I was thinking on the decadence of our generation, particularly how liberalism is eroding Christian values that built up nations. I whispered to the Lord to build up in me passionate hatred for whatever this generation accepts as good but which runs contrary to the teaching of Christ. And while I got to my office praying, this line 'Safe in the Arms of Jesus' flowed into my heart. I searched for it and it ministered greatly to my heart. It is an arsenal against the darts of corruption and immorality of all times.
Surely Jesus is there to see us through whatever tries to corrupt our faith.

In this earth everything has been created by His plan and so He has a plan for everybody.

	<article author="Sam F.Logan" email="" city="Rialto" provst="CA" country="United States" month="10" day="5" year="2010">First,I would like to give praise and honor to God Almighty, and our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Thanks to you also (Hymnal.Net) for being such a wonderful inspiration over the air waves into our homes, work places, and worship sites. Your music fills my heart and soul with joy and peace and a stressless release from the toils and snares and the many earthly burdens we face daily. Safe in the Arms Jesus was a hymn I heard over the air waves while station in Alaska with the United States Air Force Reserves during my annual two weeks tour. While sitting in my barracks(dormitory) room, your music...this hymn was sent by you or someone over the air waves. May God continue to bless Hymnal.Net, all of the hard working, dedicated employees and staff, and your untiring service to society...to the world. 

Love and Peace

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="27" year="2008">Do not consider this as a hymn used during a funeral. Do not wait until you die to enjoy the arms of Jesus when you can enjoy them today. The hymns we sing in the home meetings need not be fully in line with the fellowship in the meeting. Do not be legal. The hymns we select depend fully on whether we have the Spirit or not. If in your daily life you let the Lord make home in you, and if you are being transformed into His image by beholding His glory with unveiled face, then He will lead you. You will sense the nourishing and comforting within. The Lord may give you a hymn. Then you come to the meeting. You may be the first one in the meeting, but you do not need to wait for others. You just begin to sing, "Safe in the arms of Jesus...." As you sing you bring the spiritual atmosphere into the meeting. Those who come later will join the singing and the meeting will begin spontaneously.
