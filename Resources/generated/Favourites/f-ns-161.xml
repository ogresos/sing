Before I lived one day, you had already made them all. You embroidered my soul with your spirit. They were created that way in infinite love. And now you live there, in me, where I can commune with you, my wondrous Lord, every moment of each day. This is beyond blessing, beyond wonder, beyond words. Truly ear has not heard and eye not seen what you prepared for us, in the unseen foundations of your universe. Hallelujah!!</article>
