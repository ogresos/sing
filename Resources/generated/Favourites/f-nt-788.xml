	<article author="Christi" email="" city="Chattanooga" provst="TN" country="United States" month="10" day="20" year="2012">The Lord loves us so much. He really is with us no matter what we go thru-daily needs to crisis. We can tell Him all! He knows us and wants us to have such an intimate and personal relationship with Him no matter what time of day or night it is or what we may be going through. Praise our wonderful Lord Jesus for being so sweet!</article>
	<article author="P Watson" email="" city="Lake Forest" provst="CA" country="United States" month="4" day="23" year="2010">Amen! Talking to Jesus, like a friend, rather than appealing to Him like a God far away from us, is the best way to cultivate an intimate, personal relationship with Him. This is what God wants, to speak "face to face" like He did with Moses.</article>
