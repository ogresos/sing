	<article author="Bob Baer" email="" city="Brampton" provst="ON" country="Canada" month="10" day="5" year="2002">It reminds me of where I should be and where I really would like to be.

Where? Within the veil: within the secret of my Lord to dwell.

And it does so in such a pleasant way.

This is probably one of the top hymns written for encouraging a Christian to fellowship with the Lord.</article>
	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="4" day="1" year="2008">A hymn such as #642 in Hymns does not merely teach us. On the contrary, it unveils spiritual reality to us. Our need is not just to learn doctrines, but to open ourselves to the Lord so that we can see something. We should pray, "Lord, I open myself to You. I want to see more of You as an all-inclusive Person. Show me how Your all-inclusive death and resurrection includes me." Then as we listen to the speaking concerning Christ, we will begin to see something. What we see becomes a reality within us. Then we live by what we have seen.
