    <article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="9" day="15" year="2013">Washington Gladden believed that Christians should be involved in the world's problems - and he wasn't afraid to say so. A newspaperman-turned-clergyman, he crusaded against injustice. He fought against the infamous Tweed Ring that controlled New York City politics. He objected to John D. Rockefeller's gift to his denomination's foreign mission board because of the millionaire's policies at Standard Oil. In his various churches, he often preached a social gospel, trying to rouse his congregation to the social and labor problems that were engulfing the country.
When Gladden wrote this hymn in 1879, he said the poem had no theological significance, but that it was an honest cry of human need and of the need for divine companionship. If our friendship with Jesus does not lead us to concern for our fellowman, then we'd better check to see how closely we are walking with the Master. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>
