    <article author="Isaiah Tor" city="Sydney" provst="NSW" country="Australia" month="7" day="30" year="2009">I really appreciate the tone, the outlook and deep yearning of this hymn by Bro. Nee. Many of us would seek to have our personal hopes, affections, desires and aspirations fulfilled - yet often if we are in self, when such are fulfilled we are led away from Him. Thus it is sovereign of the Lord to "remove" what we love, allow us to be "mistrusted and reproved", "dissipate" our hopes, confirm not our fluctuating feelings, even "refuse" our every prayer, so that by His mercy, we are reduced to this one prayer, this most glorious request: "Please give Thyself to me." It is no longer a question of what I have gained or what I have lost in the natural life, or even in respect of our spiritual aspirations. The Lord would train us, would so open our being until each breath we take, we ptay to Him "Please give Thyself to me!" Indeed it so sweet to constantly gain Christ (Phil. 3:8)!</article>
    <article author="Gene Juang" city="Monterey Park" provst="ca" country="United States" month="7" day="23" year="2009">According to the the divine revelation unveils in the New Testament, God wants His people to gain Him, partake of Him, possess Him, and enjoy Him. If we have such revelation, we'd not lose heart even when our prayers are not answered. This hymn reminds me of Phil. 3:8, may we count all things loss and only Christ gain.</article>

Jesus loves me, and I see His love is everlasting who shed His blood for me and for all sinners of the world. Jesus is the Lamb of God who taketh away the sins from us. Hallelujah!</article>
