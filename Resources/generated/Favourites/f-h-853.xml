He could read Latin when he was 6, graduated from Yale at 17, began teaching there at 19, and wrote his first book at 20.
He enlisted in the Continental Army in 1777 as a chaplain, where he became known for writing songs to encourage the troops. After the Revolutionary War, he served as a pastor in Connecticut. Finally, in 1795, he accepted the trustees' invitation to become president of Yale. 
When Dwight returned to Yale, there were probably as few as 5 professing Christians on campus. But with Dwight came a new spiritual emphasis, and revival soon swept over the university. This hymn, written during the revivals at Yale, is the earliest American hymn in use today. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton
-------------------------
The 5 stanzas above are the ones that are given in most hymnals except that stanza 2 above says "the Church", while the original says "Thy church". 
There are 2 additional stanzas following the above stanza 2 which are from Psalm 137:5-6:
If eâ€™er to bless Thy sons
 My voice or hands deny,
 These hands let useful skills forsake,
 This voice in silence die.
--------------
Should I with scoffers join
 Her altars to abuse?
 No! Better far my tongue were dumb,
 My hand its skill should lose.
---------------------
There is also an additional 2nd to last stanza:
Jesus, Thou Friend divine,
 Our Savior and our King,
 Thy hand from every snare and foe
 Shall great deliverance bring.</article>
