	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="3" day="21" year="2014">Born in a log cabin, young Philip Bliss had left home at the age of 11 to work on farms and in lumber camps. He had become a Christian at the age of 12 and soon afterward developed interest in the study of music.
In the early 19th century, popular music training in America was centered in 'singing schools' - schools that were characterized by a strong spiritual emphasis and which also provided social activity for the small towns and rural communities. The 'singing school' was strictly a 1-man operation; a musician of some degree of ability traveled from place to place, organizing the classes, teaching them and collecting his fees (which might be paid either in cash or in farm produce!).
Most of the classes in sight-reading and in conducting were held at night. In the country schoolhouses, churches or town halls, the students sang the syllables (do-re-mi) while seated on planks placed between 2 chairs. Each music student also 'beat time' for himself by moving his hand and arm in a prescribed pattern. Many of our early gospel musicians started out as 'singing school' teachers. This tradition lasted more than 100 years, and had a profound effect on the quality of congregational singing and the development of church choirs.
Philip Bliss found himself strongly attracted to 'singing school' life. At the age of 21, he was married and a year later began a career as an itinerant music teacher. Using a little 20-dollar folding organ hauled from place to place by his faithful horse Fanny, he taught music during the winter seasons. During the summer he followed his own musical education and became a student himself at the Normal Academy of Music at Geneseo, NY.
Song writing came naturally to Bliss; he composed equally well in both words and music. Even during his short lifetime he was recognized as the leading writer of simple sacred songs, many of which are still widely used today. The new "Baptist Hymnal" published in 1956, includes 12 hymns for which Bliss wrote either the words or the music or both.
Although Bliss' ministry was very brief, his influence has continued down through the years. It was D. L. Moody who challenged him to leave teaching and to give his time to evangelistic crusades. In turn, Bliss urged his close friend and fellow-musician James McGranahan to undertake a similar task in gospel work. - Cliff Barrows "Crusader Hymns and Hymn Stories" quoted in "Songs of the Spirit" by Martin</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="2" day="1" year="2014">The death of Mr. and Mrs. Bliss on Dec 29, 1876 was indeed tragic. Mr. Bliss was just 38 and at the time was producing some of his best hymns. A writer of words and music, and a soloist and song leader as well (he often conducted services with Major Whittle), Mr. Bliss is described as handsome, tall and with a strong, moving bass baritone voice. Yet, friends seemed to be more impressed with his gentleness than anything else. They mourned in great numbers when he and his wife lost their lives in a fiery train wreck. Reportedly, Mr. Bliss survived the crash and climbed through a broken window to safety, but then returned to the coach trying to rescue his wife. Neither got out. In Mr. Bliss' effects was found a copy of this unpublished hymn he had recently completed. - George Beverly Shea in "Songs that Lift the Heart"</article>
	<article author="IrisCrystal Seok" email="tgnrsvt@yahoo.com" city="" provst="" country="South Korea" month="12" day="20" year="2013">This hymn which melody and tone match so well the sentiment and mood the lyric is representing, reminds me of some scripture verses: Matthew 11:25~27, Hebrews 2:10~12, Ephesians 5:8~10, Psalms 116:12~14, Philippians 3:7~11.

“At that time Jesus answered and said, I extol You, Father, Lord of heaven and of earth, because You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants. Yes, Father, for thus it has been well-pleasing in Your sight. All things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and no one fully knows the Son except the Father; neither does anyone fully know the Father except the Son and him to whom the Son wills to reveal Him.” (Matthew 11:25~27)

“For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and through whom are all things, in leading many sons into glory, to make the Author of their salvation perfect through sufferings. For both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of One, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers, Saying, ‘I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the church I will sing hymns of praise to You.’ ”(Heb. 2:10~12)
 
“For you were once darkness but are now light in the Lord; walk as children of light (For the fruit of the light consists in all goodness and righteousness and truth), Proving what is well pleasing to the Lord. (Eph. 5:8~10)
 
“What shall I return to Jehovah for all His benefits toward me? I will take up the cup of salvation and call upon the name of Jehovah. I will pay my vows to Jehovah, Oh, in the presence of all His people.”(Ps. 116:12~14)
 
“But what things were gains to me, these I have counted as loss on account of Christ. But moreover I also count all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as refuse that I may gain Christ and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness which is out of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is out of God and based on faith, to know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death, If perhaps I may attain to the out-resurrection from the dead.” (Php. 3:7~11)
 
Praise the Lord for the precious heritage of hymns from “so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us” (Heb. 12:1, Nu. 9:15~22, Ex. 13:21~22) who were “children of Wisdom”(Lk. 7:35, Mt. 11:19) as Kingdom people following Him as their wisdom and as remnant whom the Father had delivered to the Son (Mt. 11:27).
 
Yes, “the gracious gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable”(Rom. 11:29) and may the Father and the Lord of heaven and earth as well be enthroned by more and more triumphant praises from His redeemed(Ps. 22:3, 25) who had been grafted into, mingled with and incorporated into the Son of Man who, as the Reality of the ladder that Jacob saw (Gen. 28:12, Jn. 1:51, 14:6) and as the fulfillment of offerings and tabernacle, had the stance for God’s interest on this earth.</article>

This hymn text was found in Bliss's trunk after he and his wife died in a train accident in 1876. James McGranahan, who succeeded Bliss as Whittle's songleader wrote the music and used it in their meetings. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>
