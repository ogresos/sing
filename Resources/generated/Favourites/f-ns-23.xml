	<article author="Janet Owusu Ansah" email="janowu71@gmail.com" city="Bronx" provst="New York" country="United States" month="7" day="9" year="2016">It is very encouraging to know that as lovers of Christ we are with Him in ascension enjoying all the riches of His life! Hallelujah we have become His private Garden with fountain, fruits and spice for God's enjoyment! 
The more we enjoy Christ the more He makes us beautiful, as beautiful as Tirzah and eventually we become the sanctuary of God!
As we become the sanctuary of God, He forms us into an Army, a terrible Army with banners to defeat God's enemy and to usher in God's Kingdom! Hallelujah! And to consumate the New Jerusalem! I love You, Lord Jesus! ...I'm really enjoying this hymn, Jesus is Lord! Amen!</article>

	<article author="Laura Lo" email="" city="Tampa" provst="Florida" country="United States" month="11" day="13" year="2011">I needed some encouragement tonight and found myself trying to find my wedding hymn. I got married 12 years ago and the young people sang this hymn as I walked toward my husband. I thought I would be encouraged by the sweetness of this hymn, and I was..... BUT what encouraged me most was reading all the comments from all my brothers and sisters who are enjoying this hymn around the world... Nigeria, Philipines, Fiji, etc. 
I am so strengthened by you all. You remind me that our enjoyment of Christ is not just for ourselves, but is also for the strengthening and building of the Body of Christ. Our enjoyment is a sweet testimony of our love for Him. May we all be encouraged to seek Him everyday, to seize every opportunity to love Him.</article>
	<article author="Huyen Nguyen" email="" city="Soc Trang" provst="" country="Vietnam" month="7" day="10" year="2011">Amen, this song is so sweet! It refreshes my mind when every time I enjoy it. Saints, do you want to be the lovers of Christ? I really do. I experienced that the simple way to be the lover of Christ is to ENJOY HIM. The more I enjoy Him, the more I will be constituted with His life. If everyone would enjoy the Lord and be filled with His life to the uttermost, Christ will gain His counterpart, who is His beloved Bride. What miracle! What mystery! That God and man should blended be.The Triune God, tripartite man. A loving pair eternally. As man yet God they coinhere. A mutual dwelling place to be.</article>

May the Lord have mercy on us that with His own love we will love Him back with our whole being, with our whole mind and with our whole strength.</article>

	<article author="Bro. Benjie" email="" city="Mandaluyong" provst="" country="Philippines" month="5" day="15" year="2009">The church is a group of the believers of Christ who love Him. They are the crazy lovers of Christ like in Eph. 5:25 says that the Lord gave Himself up for the church. And we members of the Body which is the church will be glorified when the day comes the church will be the most beautiful in the eyes of God. Hallelujah for this great mystery: Christ and the church as the one couple as one new man. O LORD WE LOVE YOU!!!!!!</article>
