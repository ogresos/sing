	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="9" day="25" year="2013">The prophet Malachi called the Messiah the Sun of Righteousness, who would rise with healing in His wings. So John Keble was using a familiar title for Jesus when he wrote this poem. Keble first published "Sun of my Soul" in a book called "The Christian Year", which included poems to be used by believers for worship throughout the church year. An extremely modest man, Keble published this book anonymously. He used the proceeds from the sale of his book to maintain the small village church near Oxford in which he served for more than 3 decades.
Throughout his ministry, Keble was known as an outstanding preacher and a careful Bible scholar. He wrote over 700 hymns. In 1869 Keble College was founded at Oxford University as a tribute to him. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton

There are 2 additional touching stanzas which come before the last stanza above:
If some poor wandering child of Thine
 has spurned today the voice divine,
 now, Lord, the gracious work begin;
 let him no more lie down in sin.
------------------------------------------------
 Watch by the sick, enrich the poor
 with blessings from thy boundless store;
 be every mourner's sleep tonight,
 like infants' slumbers, pure and light.</article>
