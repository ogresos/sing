	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="12" day="22" year="2014">The fifth of se­ven child­ren, Mc­Gre­gor was con­vert­ed at age 20 under the min­is­try of Ca­na­di­an Bap­tist preach­er John Gil­mour (1792-1869). A grad­u­ate of the Ca­na­di­an Li­ter­a­ry In­sti­tute (The­ol­o­gy, 1878) and the Un­i­ver­si­ty of To­ron­to (BA 1881), Mc­Gre­gor joined the fa­cul­ty of To­ron­to Bap­tist Coll­ege in 1886. He was Pro­fess­or of Sys­te­ma­tic The­ol­o­gy at the time of his 1889 ap­point­ment as Prin­ci­pal. His ca­reer was, how­ev­er, short-lived. Af­flict­ed by a form of pa­ral­ys­is, he spent the lat­ter part of 1889 and earl­y 1890 con­fined to bed. He died rough­ly a month af­ter sur­ge­ry for his con­di­tion.
This is work is al­so known as “The Mc­Mas­ter Hymn” be­cause it is the of­fi­cial hymn of Mc­Mas­ter Un­i­ver­si­ty, Ham­il­ton, On­tar­io, Can­a­da. Mc­Greg­or is thought to have writ­ten these words dur­ing Ad­vent 1889. His fam­i­ly do­nat­ed the orig­in­al man­u­script to Mc­Mas­ter Un­i­ver­si­ty in 1921. - cyberhymnal

There are 2 additional stanzas following stanza 1 above:
1b Fairer far than sunlight 
unto eyes that wait
 Amid fear and darkness, 
’til the morning break;
 Fairer than the day-dawn, 
hills and dales among,
 When its tide of glory 
wakes the tide of song.
------------
1c Sweeter far than music 
quivering from keys
 That unbind all feeling 
with strange harmonies.
 Thou art more and dearer 
than all minstrelsy;
 Only in Thy presence 
can joy’s fullness be.</article>
