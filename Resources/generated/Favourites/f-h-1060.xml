She wrote many poems and hymn texts especially for the infirm, publishing 48 of them in a little book called "Under the Pillow". She may have been influenced by her aunt, Charlotte Elliott, who wrote "Just as I am". Charlotte was also a prolific poet and was sickly for much of her life.
This particular hymn was written for children, to teach them about Jesus' birth. It has a simple construction - each of the 1st 4 stanzas presents a contrast with the word "but". The chorus is a natural response to the predicament, something that even a child could understand.
The last stanza provides a stirring conclusion. The Lord, once rejected and displaced, will soon come in victory - and we should all be waiting. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>
