    <article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="26" year="2008">Watchman Nee: What is a hymn? A hymn is the expression of a person's spiritual sentiments. When a man expresses his spiritual sentiments in songs, many times his mind is not very clear, but his spirit is clear. For example in Hymns, #974, it is unclear whether the "he" refers to the Lord, to Abraham, or to us. They are all mixed together. Whatever it may be, we can touch the spirit of this hymn.
