Taking God serious is living for eternity, hallelujah!</article>

	<article author="Michael" email="" city="Kuala Lumpur" provst="" country="Malaysia" month="11" day="20" year="2013">Recently my heart has grown cold towards the Lord. Unbelief/doubt and disobedience had set in. Yet, something in me yearns for HIM, I wanted to return to HIM but didn't know how. I woke this morning singing the chorus of this great hymn in my head:
" Mercy there was great, and grace was free;
Pardon there was multiplied to me;
There my burdened soul found liberty,
  At Calvary"
I had to google it and sang along. The song made much more aware of how unfair I have been the good Lord who loved me and gave it all at CALVARY. However, it also shows me the mercy, grace and pardon that are there for me. I thank You dear Lord Jesus! Have mercy on me and forgive me my Lord. Please, brothers and sisters, pray for me.</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="3" day="25" year="2013">William R. Newell was best known as a Bible teacher, commentator, pastor and professor. While on his way to a class at Moody Bible Institute one day, the words of this hymn began to form in his mind. He didn't want to forget these ideas, so he went into an unoccupied classroom and there scribbled the words on the back of an envelope. A few minutes later he gave the words to Daniel B. Towner, the director of music at the school. Within an hour Towner had composed the music for them.
Since Newell is best known for a commentary on Romans, it is no surprise that the last stanza bears a resemblance to Romans 11:33, "Oh, how great are God's riches and wisdom and knowledge!" - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>
