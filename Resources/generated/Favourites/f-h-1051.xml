	<article author="Yeremia Alfa Susetyo" email="yere13@gmail.com" city="Salatiga" provst="Central Java" country="Indonesia" month="1" day="29" year="2016">Why the sinful man like me should become holy?
Because the bible says:
Even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be HOLY and without blemish before Him in love, (Eph. 1:4)
How can?
1 Pet. 1:18 Knowing that it was not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, that you were redeemed from your vain manner of life handed down from your fathers,
1 Pet. 1:19 But with precious blood, as of a Lamb without blemish and without spot, the blood of Christ;
Hallelujah, just come to Thee.
The precious blood of Christ is for cleansing us!</article>
	<article author="Esterabera Rarivo" email="johnhawk1976@yahoo.com" city="Antananarivo" provst="" country="Madagascar" month="1" day="27" year="2016">The first time I listened to the song I felt Our Dear Father and Lord so close to me then I was looking for the lyrics because I wanna know more about it. English is not my native language but the song means so much to me especially when we know We are all children of God and saved by the grace and merci through His Son Jesus called to come home and fill his House. My prayer is that all my family and relatives share with us the same faith about Our Lord Jesus. May Jesus Christ keep us all in His wonderful Light and undying Love until He returns. Amen.</article>

I am 77 years of age and only discovered this hymn several years ago. It is extremely moving and meaningful and the theology expressed in it is correct. Thank you for your website.</article>

	<article author="Patricia Yu" email="" city="" provst="" country="Taiwan" month="1" day="27" year="2012">主阿!我來就你!我今來就你!我是何等的罪人,竟然蒙你恩.愈經歷你,愈看見自己的天然肉體,我是何等痛苦,想要脫離這個肉身;但是我的情形實在不允許,你也把我擺在種種不堪的景況中,讓我看見自己的作威作服、天然敗壞.我本來是可以自豪自誇的告訴你:我是誰?我真實的身份背景,但我的遭遇,確讓我這人徹底的破碎.真的是讓主活,我就不要活了.
以我屬肉身的情形,世人看我不怎麼樣;以我屬靈的情形,有位前面師母也看我不怎麼樣.你卻在這樣不堪的我身上,一次又一次的臨到我,一次又一次的安慰鼓勵我,一次又一次的用你的恩膏塗抹我.主阿,我是何等的罪人,不管是屬世還是屬靈,我都被打的半死;你這位好撒瑪利亞人竟然臨及這不堪的我,沒定罪我,還親自為我裹傷敷藥,一再的囑咐我,沒有甚麼可以讓主的愛遠離我.主也讓我看見,如果我的屬靈是用來定罪人的,是用來看人不怎麼樣的,我就不是屬靈的,我也就沒有活在生命裡.因為生在我的身上發動,死就在人的身上發動;死若在我的身上發動,那生就在人的身上發動.願靠近我的人,不是死了,而是活了!
主阿!你今用恩言呼召我,又用聖靈光照我,使我知道自己的不堪,知道你是唯一夠資格且可靠的那一位.你愛我這個罪人,也讓救恩臨及我,一次又一次,不氣餒,也不放棄.主阿!我願獻上全身,再次的更新奉獻,因為我的動力是來自你所賜那---隱藏的嗎哪.</article>
