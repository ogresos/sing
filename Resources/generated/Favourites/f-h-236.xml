	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="" month="5" day="16" year="2014">James George Deck was born in England and educated for the army. He went to India as an officer of the East India Company. On a return trip to England in 1826, he was saved and also married a daughter of an evangelical clergyman. In 1835, he returned to England to live, having resigned his commission in the army. His desire was to enter the Church of England as a minister. Upon the occasion of his son's Christening, someone questioned him regarding the scriptural authority for such a practice. He searched the Scriptures but found no basis for "baptismal regeneration." Shortly afterwards, he came in touch with the Plymouth Brethren and began to preach the gospel in the counties of western England. Due to ill health, he moved with his wife and 8 children to New Zealand in 1852. Shortly after arriving, his wife died. He remarried in 1855 and his second wife bore him 5 more children until she also died, along with their 5th child, due to measles. He wrote many hymns especially during the years 1838 to 1844. He also wrote more in New Zealand after 1865. His sister Mary Jane Walker also wrote a number of hymns. - Songs of the Spirit by Martin</article>
