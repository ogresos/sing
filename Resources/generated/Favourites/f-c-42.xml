3. We treasure the Word of God
While we are young
As a child, we may read it
And read it again
Yes, the Scriptures are able 
To make us wise
Wise unto salvation
In Jesus the Lord.

4. We come to the light
When we come to God's Word
How the light brightly shines
When we really love God!
As we love Him and seek Him,
God opens His Word,
So that God's light shines brightly
In His holy Word

5 We like to spend time
In the Word of our God,
To be faithful to read it
With diligent care.
Yes, we read and we pray,
And we pray what we read - 
In the days of our youth,
We would open God's Word.

6 Remember your Creator 
While You are young
From a child, know the Scriptures
And seek out God's truth.
Oh, remember your Creator
All your life long.
And let HIm have a way
All your days on the earth.</article>

(2nd paragraph)
Remember your Creator while you are young.
To remember our Creator means
To love Him.
The Lord is the Creator, our source of life.
In the days of our youth we would
Love only Him.</article>
