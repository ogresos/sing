	<article author="Oyola David" email="" city="Nairobi" provst="Eldoret" country="Kenya" month="6" day="2" year="2012">In my Christian life, nothing has been worthy than being at the feet of Christ and listening from Him speak to me through hymns songs. This song has been my best renditions in my Christian journey to heaven. Having lost all my parents at an early age, the church became my parent. When I got converted into ths new family, I heard ths song first. It keeps giving me hope of a new heaven and a new earth where there will be no pain, death or hunger. May our lives be a testimony unto others. Amen!</article>

My dear Mother was promoted to glory on the 20 June with all her family around her as she peacefully slipped out of this mortal life for the Angels take her home, What a gift knowing the journey we are on, None of us know what twist and turns await us, happy or sad, easy of trying, but we do know that with the love of God he will hold us as a Father dose in his strong arms and keep us from stumbling.</article>

If only you Still remain in Christ Jesus.</article>
