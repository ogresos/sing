	<article author="Hymnal.net" city="" provst="" country="" month="12" day="6" year="2012">This mysterious God desires to work Himself into us. In the bread-breaking meeting most saints like to call hymn #136 in the Chinese hymnal. This is a good hymn, but it speaks of the grace of God in a superficial way. It can be compared to the rind of the watermelon. When we buy a watermelon, we eat the flesh, not the rind. Many Christians enjoy God in a superficial way; it is as if they are eating the rind of a watermelon, not the flesh. The hymns that we select show the extent to which we are in our natural concepts or in the vision of the mysterious God.
