	<article author="EG" email="eunicegarcia76@gmail.com" city="" provst="NY" country="United States" month="6" day="12" year="2014">When I first saw the henna flower I expected it to be outwardly beautiful... However, I realized later on that it is not recognized for its outward appearance but for its fragrance. This caused me to consider how our dear Lord Jesus, while on the earth, was not outwardly attractive yet drew a magnitude of people. Why? Well for sure it had nothing to do with His outward form (Isa. 53:2). It's because He is soooo attractive... like a sweet-smelling fragrance drawing us to Himself. His Person, how awesome! It's just who He is that captivated me/us. Nothing superficial—not even a trace. He is the God of this universe becoming a Man (John 1:1,14) in order to free us from the bondage of Satan, sin, the world, and even things that divide us and come into us to be our life and life supply to be enjoyed by us so that we could become His match! How we must depend on Him for everything. Praise the Lord for who He is to us!!! For drawing us to Himself, even attracting us with His beauty—His lovely Person!</article>

By 4:13, she has become like Christ, and he likens her to a fragrant garden. So it is more appropriate to liken Christ to the henna flower.

I searched for other online resources for the text of this hymn by William Spencer Walton, and could not find it. (Hymnal.net was #5 on Google search).</article>

I do not wish to go out free, but ever, always, willingly, to serve Thee to the end. He is the absolute One who can fulfill my consecration. Oh Lord Jesus.</article>

His work also testify of the beauty of His ways. I love You Lord, Saviour of my soul.

	<article author="Peter Button" email="" city="Columbus" provst="OH" country="U.S.A." month="11" day="20" year="2002">This song has such a triumphant sound to it. It really helped me through a lot of things in life. Just the simple fact of admitting that "Lord, I just cannot breathe enough of You, that I cannot have enough of You in my life" is a huge revelation and helps simplify your life. Thank you to the brothers that wrote this new tune. Oh Lord Jesus!!!</article>
