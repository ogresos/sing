	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="4" day="7" year="2008">Let us also sing another hymn, hymn 680. Both the verses and the chorus are very well written. This hymn is suitable for both the young and old. But to sing this song you need to become young again; otherwise, you will not sense the flavor of the words, "Oh love, wonderful love!" When you come to the chorus of the second verse, you should sing it softly:

He suffered crucifixion, what mercy to me,
Mercy to me, mercy to me;
He suffered crucifixion, what mercy to me,
He died to set me free.

Chinese Hymns, #680
