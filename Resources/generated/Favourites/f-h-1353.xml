    <article author="Igor Savinkin" email="igor.savinkin@gmail.com" city="Kaliningrad" provst="" country="Russia" month="2" day="14" year="2013">Thank You, Lord for such an encouraging hymn. I love it, I love to live in God who is the light of life in me. It's His divine life rather than my own introspection that enlightens my mind of the darkness in me. The same inner light transmits into my inward being all the communicable attributes of God: His love, glory, light, oneness, freshness. I wanna gain more God by living in the light of life. Light kills negative germs in me, freeing me of my old man. Lord Jesus, I love you. "For God who said: out of darkness shall shine light, He has SHINED in our hearts to illuminate the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ" 2 Corinthians 4:6.</article>
