	<article author="Sara Freeman" email="mooseinthegarden67@gmail.com" city="Spencer" provst="IA" country="United States" month="5" day="26" year="2015">These are the lyrics I grew up with for this song:
  Jesus has a table spread
  Where the saints of God are fed,
  He invites His chosen people, “Come and dine”;
  With His manna He doth feed
  And supplies our every need:
  Oh, ’tis sweet to sup with Jesus all the time!
    Refrain:
    “Come and dine,” the Master calleth, “Come and dine”;
    You may feast at Jesus’ table all the time;
    He Who fed the multitude, turned the water into wine,
    To the hungry calleth now, “Come and dine.”
  The disciples came to land,
  Thus obeying Christ’s command,
  For the Master called unto them, “Come and dine”;
  There they found their heart’s desire,
  Bread and fish upon the fire;
  Thus He satisfies the hungry every time.
  Soon the Lamb will take His bride
  To be ever at His side,
  All the host of heaven will assembled be;
  Oh, ’twill be a glorious sight,
  All the saints in spotless white;
  And with Jesus they will feast eternally.</article>

Praise the Lord! 
Christ loves to be with us.
Christ loves us!
We can take Him as food to live in Him!
Thank You Lord! 
Thank the Lord this song was on hymnal.net!</article>

	<article author="Rebecca Moore" email="" city="Sacramento" provst="CA" country="United States" month="10" day="9" year="2012">The tune is off just a bit from what I remember and I remember these words:
"Jesus has a table spread where the saints of God are fed,
He invites his chosen people Come and Dine.
With His manna He doth feed and supplies our every need. It is sweet to sup(?) with Jesus all the time.
Come and Dine the Master calleth, come and dine. Let us sit at Jesus' table all the time. He who fed the multitude, turned the water into wine, He invites His chosen people come and dine." 
I think I got this right.</article>
	<article author="Hudson" email="" city="Wellington" provst="" country="New Zealand" month="4" day="19" year="2012">After reading Leviticus Life Study message 2 I wrote another verse to "Come and Dine" same tune:
"Let us cook our living Jesus, let us cook,
All day long we enjoy Him in this song,
We experience today,
To the meetings don't delay,
Bringing Christ a gift for God, a gift for all."</article>

Since the parishioners couldn't get to the church they would sing, witness and hear the preacher while listening in on the line.</article>

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="31" year="2008">The ordinances of the offerings are a recipe of the divine cooking. Christ is the groceries, we are the cooks, and God and we are the co-eaters enjoying Christ as the satisfaction. This is the highlight of the book of Leviticus. Spiritually speaking, nothing can be higher than our enjoyment of the Triune God in Christ.

Have you ever realized that the church meeting is a cooking meeting, an eating meeting? We have spoken about coming to the meetings to eat, and in the meetings we have sung the short song "Come and Dine" (Hymns, #1148). However, we may never have had the thought that we need the cooking. The groceries are here, and the eaters are also here, but who are the cooks? I have the assurance to say that God and the Spirit are not the cooks but that we are the cooks. Therefore, we all must learn to cook.

From the types in Leviticus, we can see that God surely desires to enjoy Christ. He wants to enjoy Christ through our appreciation of Christ and through our presentation of Christ. However, even up to now, we are still too, old, traditional, superficial, and religious. May we all see that our God desires to enjoy Christ. Christ should not only be our food but also God's food through appreciation and presentation, that is, through our cooking. We all need to cook Christ that we may feed God with Christ.
