	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="5" day="14" year="2016">Charles Gabriel, said to be the "Prince of American Hymn Writers," was born on a farm shack on the plains of Iowa. He is said to have known better than any other hymn writer of his day just how to put the finishing touches on a hymn. He said that he had never had a music lesson. He said he was about 10 years old before he saw his first musical instrument, which he thought was a rough type of harpsichord. He must have had some instruction in music later, for he taught music to a group of negro boys in Texas, and later to a group of American Indians in Muskogee, Oklahoma. In his old age He testified:
"My 60 years of Gospel song have been eventful, tolerant, and interesting. Failure more often than success mars the path I have traveled. Now since the years have led me up the eastern slope and down the mountain top of life, I am hurrying toward the silent sea that lies shimmering before me. I begin to realize that my work has not been so much a failure as I had concluded. To meet those who have been helped in times past by my hymns is worth more than all the gold that was ever mined." - Hymn Stories by Wilbur Konkel</article>

It reminds me that this song is true in every aspect and it puts feelings into words that cannot be explained. This song is one of the most beautiful, touching songs I have ever heard and the feeling it gives the listener (me) is indescribably magnificent.</article>
	<article author="Rishie" email="rishie@dodo.com.au" city="Glen Innes" provst="Nsw" country="Australia" month="1" day="16" year="2013">This is beautiful. I love reading or listening to anything that reminds me that God's love for me is real. It's like precious healing balm to my heart. God is so good to inspire people to write songs like this which express so clearly the greatness of God's love and sacrifice for us.
I really like what Gary had to say about taking time to ponder and meditate on God's love and sacrifice. This is something I definitely want to do more often. 
Blessings!</article>

I was a very young woman, lost and confused and needing someone to love me for who I was... then I hear this song and it all made sense to me... I thank my heavenly Father for the wonderful missionaire that came into my life and introduce me to my eternal home... my eternal life.</article>
	<article author="Gary" email="" city="Seattle" provst="WA" country="United States" month="5" day="28" year="2012">As I ponder these old hymns (also John Newton's Let Us Love and Sing and Wonder) I see a pattern of amazement as the authors behold the love of Christ displayed in His suffering on the cross. I sense that this awe plays an important role in experiencing His presence in our lives. In I John 3, John is so amazed at the fact that we are called "children of God", that he breaks into praise emoting, "Behold what manner of love...". May God help us to give the time to ponder and meditate on the depths of His suffering and love for us.</article>

I cried for the first time singing at Sacrament meeting because the words of this song had spoken to me about the love of Jesus for us. It is so real and unconditional.</article>

I do so because I just want you to know that i'll pray for you. When you feel hopeless say to yourself that those feelings are not coming from the Lord. The Gospel of Jesus Christ is ALWAYS the gospel of HOPE... 

True messages from the Lord always help us to feel hope.
