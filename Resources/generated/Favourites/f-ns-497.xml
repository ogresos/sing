I appreciate that on the one hand as we are spending adequate time with the Lord in the morning we enjoy being supplied, strengthened, refreshed, satisfied-fed and watered... Praise the Lord for that! But this morning through this new song I'm reminded that God has a need. We can cooperate with Him by opening up and letting Him in everyday. 	
"Begin the day with God, He needs His people to
Be those who love Him best! Get up with this in view.
Rise up! Don’t wait! You’ll miss the Son.
He needs some to watch and pray.
Spend time with Him and let Him in—
To your heart so He can have His way."</article>
