    <article author="Tara" email="" city="Dallas" provst="TX" country="United States" month="3" day="10" year="2012">@Andrew &amp; anyone else interested: the guitar chords listed are from the original score, not written for guitar. A lot of times, simplify the chords by playing one per measure, whichever chord makes sense with the most notes. So, start on D, until the word abiding (v1), which is G, then D next measure.</article>

Just seems like there are way too many chords in the song, doesn't sound right.</article>

All I need to do is to abide in Him and to confide in His word, then I can hide in the bosom of His love. He is Saviour, Sanctifier, Healer, Glorious Lord and coming King.</article>
