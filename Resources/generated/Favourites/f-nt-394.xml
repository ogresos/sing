    <article author="Christina" email="" city="Newcastle" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="12" day="1" year="2009">This is what I need so much especially when in a position for making decision - to choose the Lord or the glory of the world i.e. my career, and comfortable life at home. 

Only by this Grace we can set ourselves at Him. To choose Him. To answer Him. To give our life to Him. To want the same heart desire as Him.</article>
