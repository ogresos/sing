Thank you so much for giving me the rest of the words and the music. The hymn is such a blessing.</article>
    <article author="Barbara Felix" city="Miami" provst="Florida" country="United States" month="10" day="20" year="2010">Thanks to the Lord for all His gifts, especially His gift of this site, and this song. I am sixty and have sang many hymns, but cannot remember singing this one, but God has poured out such a blessing since I found it. He has also called me to note it to be sang at my funeral. No, I am not "dying" or "ill", as we know it on earth, but in truth we all grow closer each day. I have also been sharing the site and this hymn with others as God leads. So thank you His servant, for your service to Him.</article>
