Lord, we say that we don't belong to this age, we are just sojourners seeking for a better country - the next age the kingdom age! We don't LIVE for eating, drinking, marrying and giving in marriage; we LIVE for Christ!</article>

When we include this song in a conference held in the city of Jerusalem and we all sing it, all 144,000 participants, maybe He will return! "What a meeting, what a meeting./What a meeting any moment we will share." (H1313 Chorus)</article>
	<article author="Michael Cofino" email="" city="Miami" provst="Florida" country="United States" month="8" day="17" year="2012">This hymn is so precious! It makes the Lord Jesus so much more real to me. Also I'm so encouraged to see all the comments from all over the world, but yet there is one, unique longing for the Lord. This makes me praise the Lord for the Body of Christ.</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="4" day="2" year="2011">This song brings me back to the right perspective for this life. I am a stranger and sojourner longing for My Lord to return. Even though I have the Lord's presence now, this energizes me to long for the full taste of His glorious return. This song inspires me to pray for the Lord to return and for the Lord to accomplish what needs to be done so He can return.</article>
	<article author="Siling" email="" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="11" day="21" year="2010">By the rivers of Babylon, 
there we sat down, 
yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.
We hanged our harps upon the willows 
in the midst thereof.

Psalm 137</article>
	<article author="Mee" email="" city="Singapore" provst="" country="Singapore" month="6" day="6" year="2010">I cried the first time I heard this song...
Sad because the people who have passed longed so much for Him to come back but we of this generation who are even nearer to His coming do we even long as much?</article>
