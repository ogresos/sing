Then the Holy Spirit of God "hit" me with a remembrance of our Lord's Prayer in John 17......."That Thou lovest them with the SAME loves as Thou lovest Me."  I was blessedly silenced</article>

	<article author="Tim Dennison" email="" city="Portland" provst="Maine" country="United States" month="8" day="1" year="2010">Being around so much worldliness turns my heart to matters enjoyed by the world that don't reflect God's light. I feel impressed to confess I live with guilt that makes me teeter tauter on the fence of life between sanity and insanity. My flesh is easy to feed but my soul takes a determined purposeful effort. I become slack in following my Savior, but my sometimes backsliding is followed by Him ALLWAYS letting me enter back into His presence, peace and rest. God clears my mind from sin and clutter like nothing else is able to. I feel this desolate separation from God, He convicts me of my sin, and I boldly (even though trembling, scared, weak and undeserving is simultaneously running through my feelings) approach Him knowing that even though my heart is condemning me God is greater than my heart.....I think this song is auto replay with much satisfaction and gratitude I express my sincere thanks for those of you who made it possible to have such amazing hymn music free of charge. It has truly fed my soul deep encouragement...you are blessed; thank you for passing it on...</article>
	<article author="Paul Ten" email="" city="Birmingham" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="5" day="8" year="2010">A perfect peace of mind with God is a story of the journey of struggle between the unfaithful mind and the faithful God. 

No one like to be put in a situation of uncertainty or restriction that he/she dislikes. Yet this very God who embodied in Christ come to us a a faithful one in supplying the very life that we needed so much, even in an impossible situation. It is this impossible situation that make this struggle happens and wrestle as we might, for Him, the goal is the same as the beginning and the end, i.e. impart Himself into us as the very peace within. Oh, what a life, what a peace. His Body is filled with this very peace and whoever come to have fellowship with this very Body will be at peace with God through this flow of life.</article>
