Born in Saxony, the son of a Lutheran pastor, he studied at the University of Leipzig, but his temperament was not suited to preaching. He became a teacher at the university. Many of his poems have an instructional tendency. - Songs of the Spirit by Martin

the original last stanza says:
Jesus lives! to Him the throne
 over all the world is given:
 may we go where He has gone,
 rest and reign with Him in heaven.
Hallelujah!</article>
