Having graduated as a teacher in 1935, she went to northern Ontario to find work. She eventually returned to Toronto, where she taught for 31 years. She is noted for her poems, hymns, articles for Christian magazines, and 17 books on various subjects in 7 languages. - Songs of the Spirit by Martin

In 1946 Margaret wrote what she called her "first real hymn" at the request of Stacey Woods, General Secretary of Intervarsity Christian Fellowship. "We Come O Christ, To Thee" was written to "link together the widely-scattered groups that made up the young student movement." - Wheaton College Archives</article>
