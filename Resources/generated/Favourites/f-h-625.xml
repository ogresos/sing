stanza 2 "Love inscribed upon them all"
stanza 4 "Trials give new life to prayer."
----------
There are 2 additional stanzas usually omitted:
2b. God in Israel sows the seeds,
Of afflictions, pain and toil;
These spring up, and choke the weeds,
Which would else o'erspread the soil;
------------
3b. Bastards may escape the rod,
Sunk in earthly vain delight;
But the true born son of God;
Must not, would not, if he might.</article>
