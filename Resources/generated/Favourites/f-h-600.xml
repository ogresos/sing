	<article author="Hymnal.net" city="" provst="" country="" month="2" day="6" year="2013">Since we have been justified, we have entered into another realm—the realm of grace. In this realm of grace our enjoyment is God Himself. Romans 5:11 says, "Boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation." Our boast is not in our reputation, education, home, possessions, or situation, all of which are worthless when compared to God. Our boast is in our God, and our glory is in Him. Recently, my wife and I moved into a new apartment. After everything in it had been arranged, I looked at it and was very pleased. However, as I was admiring it, the Spirit reminded me that these things are worthless compared to God. Then I opened to Hymns, #600: "My God, my Portion, and my Love, / My everlasting All." God is our eternal portion. Outward things may be good in a shallow sense, but they cannot compare with God. We have peace toward God, we are glorying and boasting in Him, and we are enjoying Him.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="27" year="2008">God called Paul and said to him, "I send you, to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith in Me" (Acts 26:17b-18). This inheritance is God as our possession, that is, God as our land with its rich produce. Today man needs land to provide food for his living and a lodging for his rest. As we have seen, Psalm 16:5 says, "Jehovah is the portion of My inheritance," and Psalm 90:1 says, "O Lord, You have been our dwelling place / In all generations." Hymns, #600 is written based on these two psalms. The general idea of the hymn is that God is our eternal portion, our everlasting all, and our safe abode. God is our land and our dwelling place. It is no wonder that when the Lord Jesus came, He said, "Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest" (Matt. 11:28). Moreover, in John 15:4 He said, "Abide in Me." Today all men have lost God as their possession, and they have no real dwelling place. Fallen people are all drifting about and wandering without a home. Although they may live in high-rise buildings or large mansions, within them there is no rest, no dwelling place. Man is wandering because he has lost God. God is man's real dwelling place and real possession.
