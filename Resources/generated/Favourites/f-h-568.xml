I love my Lord and King and have lived most of my life knowing that He has been more than faithful to me. How can those who claim to love and follow our Lord, wound others so deeply and without remorse? I didn't know it was possible to be hurt so deeply until lately. I am thankful for tears and for others who can weep with me. I am also thankful for Louisa Stead who in wrote the words to - Tis So Sweet to Trust in Jesus. Perhaps she too knew the pangs of suffering. The lyrics were certainly written from a heart who was in love with the Lord Jesus. As I began singing each verse, I felt the strength of God rising within me and Oh how I needed that. I know my storm will eventually pass and friend take courage because yours will too.

	<article author="Emmanuel Unigwe" email="" city="Houston" provst="Texas" country="United States" month="5" day="16" year="2011">I gave my life to Christ in Lagos, Nigeria in 1985, I kept pressing forward but challenges are too much for me to handle and it has been rough and hard to bear during these years of challenges. A week ago I walked into a church where the word of God came and the person asked me, if I have a Bible, even though I was with a Bible, she went ahead to give me the message that God sent to me in Isaiah 1:18 to come and reason with Him, that I should fast 2 days. At first I was in denial and a bit trouble that such message is for new born babe's in the Lord. But I could not resist the power in that message, then I knew God has come to rescue me and I went into a week fasting, then God started with me the book of Job 38:4. I can tell you that He lead me to several scripture passages to prove He's still in control, if I could trust. I immediately rededicated myself to God and promised to trust Him always. At the local church I attended yesterday, the entire messages and choir song was just the same message of trust and purity. I thank God that, I have program the song from your site 'TIS SO SWEET To TRUST IN JESUS in my computer to play the lyrics non stop. I praise God for you, who made this possible to the entire Christianity to listen. God bless you.</article>
