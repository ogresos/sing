The song conveys the truth of the Gospel message. The only hope of salvation left for all mankind is in the finished work of Christ on the cross. I pray for all who had put their trust in Him to remain faithful unto the end.</article>

This is a revelation, a taking away of the veils of all the things I tried to do to be right with God, and be relieved of the heaviness and emptiness of a life of sin. Thank You, Jesus, for saving me, and that You are still so real to me today as the day when You first brought Yourself and Your love into my life. I never had anything of value to bring to make myself worthy to be saved, but today I am full of thanksgiving, praise, and love for my wonderful Savior Jesus, and His unique 
Work!</article>

Nothing can save us except faith in Christ. It's not about works, or about how much we want something, but about Christ who died on the cross for us and "suffered on the tree".

It is Him who saves us eternally, and the One who saves us everyday. We just need to put our faith in Him, to work in us. Rather "ourselves" working. :)  And I like the tune, and it's really simple song, which is why I also like it.</article>
	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="4" day="1" year="2008">My friends, you must see that salvation is not of yourselves. You must realize from your heart that everything is of the Lord Jesus. Faith is not a virtue. Faith is just receiving. One of our gospel hymns says, "Working will not save me" and "Weeping will not save me" (#1000 in Hymns, published by Living Stream Ministry). The last stanza says, "Faith in Christ will save me." When I first saw this line, immediately I crossed it out and replaced it with "Jesus alone will save me." Faith is not a virtue. Faith is just to allow the Lord to save us. It is like a person who falls into the sea. When someone comes to save him by throwing him a net, he does not have to do anything. As long as he does not jump out of the net, he will be fine. Everything is done by the Lord Jesus. Hallelujah! I say again, never misunderstand James 2. Work in James 2 is not a question of being good or bad, but of having or not having faith.
