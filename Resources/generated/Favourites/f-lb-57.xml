    <article author="Wayne Johnson" email="waynej@elektrolumens.com" city="Grants Pass" provst="Oregon" country="United States" month="1" day="12" year="2014">I wrote this song 30 some years ago. Howard listened to it, commented it needed something, and he wrote the chorus tune and words. Imagine, here was a woman, in a graveyard, very early in the morning. She was grieving the loss of the One she loved the most. Then, suddenly, there He is, standing there speaking with her. One moment she was in exceeding sorrow, the next moment, she was in exceeding rapture, being with the One she loves. What words could ever convey what she was experiencing. One day I was in quiet prayer over these versus in John 20, and it was as if I was again experiencing the joy she experienced, and, I wrote down these words and the melody flowed to me on the piano. One must remember that experiencing the Lord, it is altogether firstly a matter of prayer, the spirit, and God's word, mingled together as one. If we simply try to experience the emotions of love, or being 'beside oneself, it will not happen. We should not seek an emotional experience, but just as Mary did, seek the Lord Himself, His person. Every morning, early, I am still a seeker and lover of Jesus, and, each morning early, I meet with Him. And I am very happy and glad to say, He is still just as sweet and real today, even this morning, as the day which I wrote this song.</article>

    <article author="Steven" email="" city="Pleasant Prairie" provst="WI" country="United States" month="6" day="21" year="2010">The lyric "beside myself" challenges me. I want to be "beside myself" and feel I am not legally able.

I'm going to try anyway. Cain slew Able, and better to risk a caning than to give up the chance of knowing the emotion I seek (again).</article>
