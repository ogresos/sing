	<article author="Sandy Williams" email="sandyw148@hotmail.com" city="Brampton" provst="Ontario" country="Canada" month="12" day="28" year="2013">When the Lord Jesus was on earth, great crowds followed Him. Multitudes were saved and healed, and multitudes received the favor of God. Eventually, however, there were only about one hundred and twenty in the upper room. The crowds, the multitudes, did not afford the Lord Jesus anything for His move. The Lord's move was with those in the upper room, with those whose eyes had been opened and whose hearts had been touched. This small number came into the upper room to be burned, and then they turned the whole world upside down. The principle is the same today. It is a small number who will turn the world upside down and change the age.

My education is not my goal, neither is money, career nor just a "good life".

Hallelujah!!</article>

	<article author="Roger Gentry" email="" city="Phoenix" provst="AZ" country="U.S.A." month="11" day="2" year="2007">Knowing that God has called us for His purpose is a most encouraging word. To know His purpose is a great mercy. It has been nearly forty years since I touched the recovery" country="and it has been tough at times. Today after so long a time I am thrilled to be able to say it has been well worth everything I have been through. Praise the Lord.  When I first heard Bro. Lee speak concerning the human spirit and the  matter of Life and how critical it is to see that Life is in our spirit, it cleared up so many personal issues I had at the time. After growing up in a christian home, I believed that Jesus had come into my heart at the age of ten as I knelt before the Lord and asked Him to come in. Later as I tried to live the christian life I became bothered that if Jesus was in heart how come I failed in so many ways. Today I am thankful to know Jesus is in my spirit as the Life-giving Spirit desiring to spread into all my heart. Now from my spirit Christ is spreading to my mind, emotion, and will, saving my soul little by little, day by day. Hallelujah! Jesus said in Matthew 16:18 "I will build my Church". Afterward the Apostle Paul realized the Church is His Body, and Christ is the Head. In the One Body there is One Spirit. We are kept in One Spirit by submitting to the One Head, Christ. How else could we be built up? Each one of us needs our souls to be saved, no part of my natural man, the man of the old creation have any part in the New Man of which Christ is the Head, therefore we must deny any thought that the Christ in our spirits would want division. Today in many localities, there are some who have missed the basic point. When in spirit I would never have a thought to divorce the Body. If I have a conflict concerning anything about what the Lord desires, I should first take it to the Lord then to the Brothers. We should always be ready and willing to submit to the Lord through the brothers to maintain the oneness. We must reject everything that would cause division. What ever problem arises in the church the Head of the body is more than able to resolve. We should only care to remain under the Headship of Christ. May the Lord bless His recovery to fulfill His purpose.</article>
