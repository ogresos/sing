	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="12" day="24" year="2014">Born in Lakehurst, New Jersey, Miles attended Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and the University of Pennsylvania. In 1892, he abandoned his ca­reer as a phar­ma­cist and wrote his first Gos­pel song, He served as ed­i­tor and man­a­ger at the Hall-Mack pub­lish­ers for 37 years. In his own words:
"It is as a writ­er of gos­pel songs I am proud to be known, for in that way I may be of the most use to my Mas­ter, whom I serve will­ing­ly al­though not as ef­fi­cient­ly as is my de­sire." - hymntime
Miles was an amateur photographer who wrote many of his hymns in a darkroom, while waiting for the photographs to develop. - hymnpod
He also wrote the words and music for "I come to the garden alone", which tune is used for "O glorious Christ, Savior mine" #501, and which lyrics were probably the inspiration for #554 "I come to His presence afresh".</article>

	<article author="Rosita Enriquez" email="" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="11" day="30" year="2011">Isaiah 62:4 says "And it will no longer be said to you, Forsaken! / Nor to your land will it be said any longer, Desolate!,/ But you will be called, My delight is in her, and your land, Married;/ For Jehova delights in you, / And your land will be married." The word Beulah stands for "Married" in this verse. 

Lord, no longer forsaken nor desolate, but we are called "My delight is in you," we are called "Married."
Self, I do not believe your lies, I am in another realm, my mingled spirit, where I am in full satisfaction with my Lord.</article>

	<article author="Isaiah Tor" email="" city="Sydney" provst="NSW" country="Australia" month="8" day="21" year="2008">This hymn grants to us not merely the atmosphere of the heavenlies in Christ, but also the reality of a life lived on the earth yet in full organic union with our Bridegroom, Christ Jesus. The applicability of this hymn lies not in the apparent security noted in verses 1-3, but rather in the security that is the context of being in Christ to enjoy Him in one spirit with Him, as revealed in the chorus. The focus of this hymn in all its poetic utterances relates to being in Christ, abiding in Him, tarrying in Him, "married" to Him and thereby enjoying Him in spirit to the uttermost degree even whilst on this earth. Beulah relates not to earthly pleasures, but rather to being securely dwelling in spirit, enjoying Him to the degree that qualifies us as His Bride in present reality, that all that He is becomes our present, continual enjoyment in adversity.</article>
	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="4" day="1" year="2008">Beulah means married in Hebrew.

Isaiah 62:4 And it will no longer be said to you, Forsaken! Nor to your land will it be said any longer, Desolate! But you will be called, My delight is in her, And your land, Married; For Jehovah delights in you, And your land will be married.</article>
