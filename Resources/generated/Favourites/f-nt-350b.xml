There's a brother who is going to graduate from the FTTA this term, really loves this hymn. He loves this hymn because it says,"My goal is God Himself, not joy nor peace, nor even blessing, but Himself, my God,..." I really enjoy this hymn too. It leads me to the question, "How many times have I been thinking about the Lord as my unique goal?" I repent and now return, cause my heart for You to burn,... One thing I know, I cannot say Him nay; One thing I do, I press towards my Lord; My God my glory here, from day to day, and in the glory there my great Reward. *****</article>
	<article author="El" email="" city="London" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="11" day="2" year="2009">These lyrics inspire me to always keep the faith, never let Him go. I have through some real dark times emotionally, but my love for my God, my glorious Saviour is hidden deep, deep within my heart; this love is far beyond emotions, logic, intellect. He will never fail to bring me through the dark times, you may feel so low at times, but when your testing is over, you'll wake rise with the likeness of Christ, to receive the crown of life in eternal glory. Keep the faith!</article>
	<article author="Gloria Liu" email="" city="Hamilton" provst="" country="New Zealand" month="2" day="6" year="2009">Amen! I really enjoy the first line of this song: "My goal is God, HIMSELF, not joy nor peace". So many times, I ask the Lord for peace in an exam, for good marks, for many things. But now I realize that I just need God, HIMSELF! I just need to gain Him! THEN I will have the peace and rest in my being. 
I really experienced this. I was trying to cram for an exam, then I realized that it wasn't working. So, I just gave up and told the Lord, "Lord, if You want me to enter in uni, You'll have to supply me in this exam, there is nothing else I can do." Then I just forgot about everything and started singing. I really really enjoyed and gained the Lord in that exam! Praise the Lord! He is all we need!! ^^</article>
