I did not have the words so I began to look online for it. Praise God I found it. I will use it for our choir. It is so wonderful.  Praise His Holy Name......

	<article author="Lewis Briley" email="amasa3@att.net" city="Pipe Creek" provst="TX" country="United States" month="12" day="2" year="2012">I was adopted by a very old man, and this was his very favorite hymn. He often requested it in church - but as nobody knew the words or music - until he died in 1964 he never got to hear it. Neither did I, until now.

Thank you.</article>

	<article author="Josephine" email="" city="" provst="" country="Malaysia" month="10" day="17" year="2006">Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow. Though they be red as crimson, they shall be as wool. This is our pitiful condition at heart...sins as scarlet and as red as crimson. Heretofore, praise the Lord!!!

We hear the voice that entreats us to return unto God. The entreating voice of great compassion and of wondrous love of God. We have to hearken to the entreating voice of God and return ye unto God!

He'll forgive your transgressions and remember our sins no more...this is what the Lord your God saith : Look unto Me, ye people. Look unto the Lord your God who will forgive your transgressions and remember them no more!</article>
