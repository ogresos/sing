"There are many ways to share "the wondrous story." Some speak it, some sing it, and some paint it: but God asks all of us, with His help to live it. When we show our love for Christ through our daily activities, we are truly singing the story "with the saints in glory."
To sing the story, we need the gift of our Savior's presence. Even though He is back in glory, Christ continues - through the Holy Spirit - to be with those He came to save. He takes us by the hand and leads us safely through the "days of darkness" that come now and then.
Christ is not only with us but has also remained righteous, just like His heavenly Father. What joy that puts into our song! As Jesus' righteousness shines through us, we can point others to the Father.
Dear God, I praise You for Scriptures and songs about Your love. Thank You for the opportunity to sing Your story through my daily living. Thank You, Jesus, for holding me by the hand, especially when everything seems dark and unsafe. Keep me singing about You and Your righteousness." - Betty Free Swanberg in "How Sweet the Sound" by George Beverly Shea</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="7" day="10" year="2013">Twenty-one year old Peter Bilhorn approached Pastor Francis Rowley one Sunday night after the evening service. The year was 1886; the place was North Adams, Massachusetts. Young Bilhorn had been converted the previous year, and already he was using his musical talents for the Lord. "Why don't you write a hymn for me to set to music?" he asked Pastor Rowley.
Rowley's response was this gospel song, which originally began "Can't you sing the wondrous story?" [Ira Sankey changed it.] For Bilhorn, who was a singer as well as a pianist and organist, it was an ideal personal testimony. As an unconverted teenager, he had started his music career singing in Chicago taverns. He understood the line "I was lost but Jesus found me - found the sheep that went astray."
Bilhorn went on singing the wondrous story the rest of his life, writing 2,000 songs. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton
The original last 2 lines of the chorus are:
Sing it with the saints in glory,
Gathered by the crystal sea.
The original last stanza is:
He will keep me till the river
Rolls its waters at my feet;
Then He'll bear me safely over,
Where the loved ones I shall meet.</article>
