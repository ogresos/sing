Nothing bad at all. In our perspective, often times we think it's the end of the world when something bad happens to us. But we are like frogs looking up from the bottom of a well. Hallelujah in God's perspective, nothing bad can happen to us because everything is done and arranged by God for our growth in life and for His purpose!!! God wants to gain our heart through every situation we go through. 
Whatever may happen in my life, keep my heart open and soft toward You. Keep me looking away unto You Lord, keep dispensing Yourself into my being!</article>

Set our minds on things that are above, not on the things that are on earth.
We love You Lord Jesus!</article>

	<article author="Yohanna" email="yohanna.e.andujar@gmail.com" city="Brooklyn" provst="Ohio" country="United States" month="9" day="14" year="2013">The only way we can believe in Jesus is if we see Him :) And I'm not speaking about seeing Him physically but spiritually. We need Him to appear to us, as He did with Abraham in the Old Testament and Paul in the New Testament. Nor Abraham or Paul saw Him physically BUT His appearance was enough to make them a believers :) Abraham is called "the father of faith" and "the friend of God", and Paul changed his life, his way, his scale of values, his everything because what he saw of God made him a believer. Is not enough just to hear about God, we need to see Him, then we are going to be captivated by Him :)

Lord, make me a believer by looking at You daily. Keep my eyes looking at You. Don't let me get distracted with other things that are not You. Increase my hunger for You, that I may enjoy You in your Word daily. O Lord, dear Lord I JUST LOVE YOU!</article>

	<article author="Sam" email="sbibby5265@yahoo.com" city="Phoenix" provst="Arizona" country="United States" month="2" day="20" year="2013">To answer JF question

John 20:25 The other disciples therefore said to Thomas, We have seen the Lord! but he said to them. Unless I see his hands the mark of the nails and put my finger into the mark of the nails and put my hand into His hand into his side, I will by no means believe.

So Thomas is saying "make me a believer." by looking at Him.</article>
	<article author="Ernesto Guerrero" email="ernestogro@yahoo.com" city="Boca Raton" provst="Florida" country="United States" month="12" day="21" year="2012">There in no verse in the Bible that speaks of "Make me a believer". But there many instances throughout the Bible where God Himself opens the door for us to Believe.
John 1:12, John 1:43-51 and this precious one in John 3:15.
This song does strike a core, because many time we act as "un-believers" in our Christian walk, but our keeping our spiritual eyes looking at Him, in His word, this will increase our faith and love for Him. Everyday I need Him to "make me a believer" so I can grow in life and be a useful vessel unto Him.</article>

	<article author="Sis LC" email="" city="Auckland" provst="" country="New Zealand" month="6" day="14" year="2011">I like to pray "Lord, no matter what happens, may I still love You." Whenever I wait for exam results to come out or jobs to be released.

We know that we are weak. My biggest fear is to be blinded by our own desires and miss seeing God's will for us in the situation when the situation comes. 

May we have a heart that is open and soft toward Him. Father, we know that You love us. Whatever this situation is all about, by faith we know this is working out to salvation. All we want is Your presence now.</article>

	<article author="Riselda Gasler" email="" city="The Church in Long Beach" provst="CA" country="United States" month="7" day="12" year="2008">This song reminds me about our dear Bro. Tom Engel who went to be with the LORD. The Last time he attended the meeting he sang this song to the Church in Long Beach. This was his favorite song. He kept on singing this song. Though his physical body was weakening his spirit was so fresh and even refresh the saints who are visiting him. I believe every word of this song uplifted his spirit and even supplied the saints around him.
Whenever I sing this song, I am ushered into my spirit. This song became a prayer of mine too. Praise the LORD.
We also sang this song during his memorial.</article>
