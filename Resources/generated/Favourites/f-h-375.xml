	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="2" day="10" year="2013">Cleland McAfee, a Presbyterian minister in Chicago, had just received word that his brother and sister-in-law had lost both of their daughters to diphtheria within 24 hrs. Grief-stricken, McAfee couldn't think of deep theological issues; he could only think of verses in the book of Psalms that brought comfort and rest to those who sought refuge in the Lord. As he meditated on God's Word, he wrote the words and music to this simple hymn.
At the double funeral, outside the darkened quarantined house of his brother, Cleland McAfee with a choking voice sang this hymn publicly for the 1st time. The following Sunday, his church choir sang it from their pastor's handwritten copy. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>

	<article author="Betty Jane Bonn" email="" city="Dunlap" provst="Illinois" country="United States" month="11" day="20" year="2012">On June 30 I posted about our son (50 years old), that he get a job after 3 1/2 years without a job. He is a Christian and an excellent computer programmer, but downsizing and a thing called "unemployment discrimination" worked against him. During that time he lost his condo and all contents; he became homeless and lived in his car. He didn't get the job for which we prayed on June 30, but on July 24, 2012, he started a new job and was able to move into a motel. he immediately instituted a program of debt reduction and declared a year of austerity. In November he moved into a new condo. I thank the Lord that he saw us through this heart wrenching time. We remained near to the heart of God in our prayers for our son and lifted him up every day before the throne of God. All praise to our Heavenly Father forever! Our thanks to all of you who prayed for our son! We're so thankful for this fellowship of believers all over the world! Please agree with us that all the emotional wounds our son incurred during this time of joblessness and homelessness be healed out of memory. Thank you and God bless you all.</article>
	<article author="Hazel Cornes" email="" city="Bridgend" provst="Mid Glam" country="" month="11" day="5" year="2012">Thrilled to find this hymn. I sometimes paint pictures and offer them to a friend with a meaningful quote. We all need a quiet place from time to time. This was not only nostalgic but a real blessing to read again and sing to the music. The other comments were also a blessing. Thank you for the idea, and the Holy Spirit's binding in fellowship.</article>
	<article author="Betty Bonn" email="" city="Dunlap" provst="Illinois" country="United States" month="6" day="30" year="2012">Today (Saturday), and tomorrow, I am particulrly abiding in this song, "Near to the Heart of God" and in this Scripture: John 15:7 (KJV) 
7 If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you. 
We are believing for the news Monday to be that my son (50 years old) has a job after 3 1/2 years without a job. He is an excellent computer programmer, but downsizing and a thing called "unemployment discrimination" have worked against him for some time now. Please agree with us in prayer that he receives this job. God bless you all--our hearts all need His heart in order to live--near to the heart of God.</article>

	<article author="Yallah" email="" city="Idyllwild" provst="CA" country="United States" month="9" day="15" year="2011">This song encourages me to long for the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ.

	<article author="Anson Malcolm" email="" city="Toronto" provst="Ontario" country="Canada" month="8" day="31" year="2011">I went to a funeral for one of my wife's relative and on the program this was one of the songs that was sung. I remembered as a boy over 45 years ago, that song was always sung by the choir and it has always brought a great blessing to me and after not hearing it for so long, I must say nothing has changed.</article>
	<article author="Jude Sears" email="" city="Riverton" provst="Southland" country="New Zealand" month="12" day="31" year="2009">The words of this song have been imbedded in my memory since who knows when, and every now and then God brings them up to the surface and reminds of the wonderful rest that can only be found in His presence. I was delighted to find all the lyrics of this song. Thank you and bless you.</article>
	<article author="Liz Dickson" email="" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="12" day="11" year="2009">This blessed my heart on a stormy day. I hear this song each time I read Hebrews 4:9 "There remains a rest for the people of God". And Psalm 31:20 "You shall hide them in the secret place of Your presence". The beautiful piano accompaniment was a blessing to the words as they brought me near to the heart of God. Thank you.</article>
