* or, destined, set, located. God has destined, appointed, that we should pass through afflictions. Hence, afflictions are God's allotted portion to us, and He has set us, located us, in a situation of afflictions.</article>
    <article author="Evangeline Ngo" city="Diamond Bar" provst="California City" country="United States" month="10" day="1" year="2009">Why take anxious thought, since the mind of Jesus Christ cares for those He bought? Our life is more than food, and our body is more than clothing. Both our life and our body were brought into existence by God, not by our anxiety. Since God created us with a life and a body, surely He will care for their needs. Once we have seen Christ, we never take the same way but always take another way. Amen Lord! Thy will is mine, whatever it be! Praise You Lord, You are sovereign over all things. Hallelujah!</article>
