Jesus Lord I love You. Is there any beside our God, no there is none, absolutely none like our God. Situations may make us feel we want so many things but in the end we still realise we want nothing beside our God. He is life to our soul by becoming life in our spirit. without Him we are in death, corruption and degradation but in Him we have abundant life joy and peace Himself as our enjoyment and completion. Our God is our need. Nothing in this whole world satisfies as You do Lord. Amen.</article>

	<article author="Maame" email="" city="Graeter Accra" provst="" country="Ghana" month="8" day="3" year="2012">There is nothing real in any part of this universe, all is not trustworthy. Everything, everyone, all things are not trustworthy, only disappointing. But my Lord alone is a constant Person in all our situations. Life is painful, full of painful sufferings one after the other. Only God is constant and always abiding. Even when we fail and let Him down over and over He still is constant, never changing, always abiding, full of love toward us. Lord I'm amazed by Your love, I am enthralled by Your love and I am clear a little bit of life's disappointing ways. Without You Lord everything and everyone seeks their own but You O Lord, You seek me, I am Your own Lord Jesus. Help me, O Lord to trust You, to not go astray again, to grow into Your likeness and to care for Your sheep also. I love You dear Lord Jesus. I have none beside You, Lord. In all the world Lord Jesus You alone are mine. All I have is You, Lord, all I have is You, Lord, all I have is You, Lord.</article>

	<article author="Sister Nika" email="" city="Manila" provst="" country="Philippines" month="7" day="16" year="2011">Amen! Sometimes we try the world but nothing could satisfy us the way the Lord does. Nothing in the whole world can ever compare with the Lord. Also sometimes we just wander away, but thank the Lord His love seeks us, so we could turn back to Him.

"Lord, we want to turn from the world to You Lord. Because nothing satisfies me the way You do. Lord, I just love You!"</article>
	<article author="Dominador Manlusoc" email="" city="" provst="" country="Philippines" month="9" day="6" year="2010">A sister translated this hymn to Filipino about ten years ago:

Oh Hesus, Mahal ko.
Wala nang nais pa.
Wala na sa mundo
Sa aki'y makasiya.
Lumayo man ako,
Mahal Mo pa rin ako,
Pag-ibig abot 'ko;
Ako'y babalik sa Iyo.</article>

	<article author="Lu Chung Zsan" email="" city="Taipei" provst="" country="Taiwan" month="5" day="22" year="2003">I like this song because I really feel that the Lord is the very best. There are a lot of things in the world always showing their attracting appearence to us. The more I pursued, the more I feel thirsty and in my deep within, there was a sigh.

Thank the Lord! Although I often leave Him to pursue others, He is always calling me to enter His love and enjoy His unsearchable riches. As long as I turn to Him and answer His calling, I really feel satisfied so that I want to tell Him "Lord Jesus, thanks for Your love and now I want to pour all my love onto You!"</article>
	<article author="" email="" city="Toronto" provst="ON" country="Canada" month="9" day="2" year="2002">I love this song because it’s my experience.

Regardless of how many desires, wishes, or wants are in my heart, what I’m ultimately seeking is the Lord.  Although I may complain and wander away from Him for a time, His love always manages to draw me back to Him. Each time this happens, I get a clearer realization of a single fact: nothing satisfies me but Him. I know, deep down, that He’s all I want. I can’t help but love Him.</article>
