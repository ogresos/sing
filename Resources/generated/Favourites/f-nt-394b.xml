	<article author="Igor Savinkin" email="igor.savinkin@gmail.com" city="Riga" provst="" country="Russia" month="2" day="5" year="2014">I do enjoy this hymn. And as I was singing it I reconsecrated myself for His best work on me, for me to go further in growth in life. I need His mercy and grace for going on in this race, but eventually this all is for the church, for the living corparate expression of our beloved Lord Jesus.</article>

How wonderful to find a song to strengthen us based on the hope and belief in God, that we put our trust in Him. It doesn't get more simpler than that.</article>

	<article author="Precious Pearl" email="" city="Southampton" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="6" day="19" year="2011">This song is a most powerful prayer. Sometimes when we feel happy with the Lord and we are really enjoying Him and the church life we utter prayers such as this. We ask the Lord for growth and grace we even tell Him to purge us and prune us. We can do this at these times because we are so full of love and enjoyment. But our God is so faithful and He knows what lies ahead. He knows what we need to pass through in order to see the result of such prayers. As we experience the sun and shower and the self abasing we may ask the Lord, why? Then He in His mercy reminds of all those powerful prayers we prayed.This then becomes faith in us. If He is going to answer those prayers as He promised then He must take us through this situation or that until at last we win the glorious race. Thank You dearest Lord that Your loving eye is on me.</article>

It's a good heartfelt prayer towards our lovely Jesus Lord. May this be our genuine prayer, that we live because Thou dost livest. That our experience of Him would deeper and deeper grow.</article>
	<article author="S.M." email="" city="" provst="California" country="United States" month="12" day="27" year="2009">Amen from Thy fulness Grace outpoured. Col. 2:9 For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.
Lord, I live because Thou livest. Oh Lord give more life to me. Praise You Lord, it's by Your grace that we receive Your life. Oh Lord, Master, every moment water me. Praise You Lord You're the living water. Amen.</article>
