    <article author="David Stuart" city="Gateshead" provst="Tyne &amp; Wear" country="United Kingdom" month="2" day="26" year="2012">James, I have read your note a couple of times and wanted to share with you the grief of losing your son whose age you do not give. I have never thankfully been in such a situation although I am sure that the Lord Himself will have sustained you through such a difficult period. You will have found much consolation in hymns such as this one as well as the scriptures and other matters. May God Himself continue to bless you in the years which he graciously allows us. I hope that hymnal.net will allow the publication of this my email address, if you wish to drop me a note: foxtrot_delta_sierra@yahoo.co.uk. Thank you.</article>

I looked in the Brethren hymn book but could not find it, so I tried to find it and sure enough I found it and it brings tears to my eyes just to sing it. I did not realize there was so many verses. Love, in Him. James.</article>
