I have a strong desire to get on a schedule to carry this out. Please pray for the Lord's blessing, covering, leading, protection, and that He would release the captives!!!

This song is telling us about the sacrificial steps Christ too when He was a man on earth. He left His glory to serve others. He lead a good example for all. We should continue evangelizing as Christ taught us.</article>
