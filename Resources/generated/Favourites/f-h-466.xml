Yet in my experience, even after giving all, and thinking I have gained something, He still knocks on my heart. In Song of Songs 5:2, 4, He is knocking with His wounded hand. In Revelation 3:20, He also is knocking to find entrance. When I think I have something, and become settled, satisfied and passive, He knocks to come in. He knocks in love and reproof to show and give more of Himself.</article>
