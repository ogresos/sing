	<article author="Razel Flores" email="" city="Quezon City" provst="" country="Philippines" month="7" day="8" year="2009">I am a sister from the Philippines presently working in Dubai. Through the Lord's sovereignty, He has released two of my colleagues to pursue Him in His word (Bible reading with footnotes) once a week and it's our third meeting now. I thank the Lord for having this site since we have no copy of any hymn at the moment. We usually sing before we start and I let them learn new songs every time we meet. I believe the Lord is working within them since I can see their joy every time we meet. This is one of the hymns we have enjoyed singing together..."Lord, continue to grant us the supply of Your grace. May You continually grow in me especially to my colleagues. Gain them bit by bit and day by day as You have gained me. Increase their appetite for Your word that through their enjoyment and maturity in You more vessels around our workplace will be released and be supplied with Your grace. Keep us faithfully loving You and Your word 'til You come back. Amen!</article>
