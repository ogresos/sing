	<article author="Maritess" email="mari_billy@yahoo.com" city="" provst="" country="" month="6" day="23" year="2014">:) One of our fears is that of the unknown when we don't know about tomorrow. When what happens is not what we expect. When we are too anxious considering many possibilities. Whether by force, we simply can't help it to tell the Lord everything. Those sweet, intimate conversations you can only have with the only One.</article>

	<article author="Tony" email="" city="London" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="11" day="12" year="2008">After the children of Israel crossed the Red Sea, the pillar of cloud led them to Marah, and then to Elim. If we study a map, we shall see that they did not journey in a way that was according to the human concept, but in a way that was according to the divine concept... Remember that it was God Himself in the pillar that led the people on their journey... our concept is that this experience of resurrection will be on a way that is upward, not on a way that leads downward. In our opinion, any way that leads downward is not in resurrection. Yes, in itself resurrection takes us upward, but its application requires us to take a way that leads in a downward direction.

	<article author="ruby" email="" city="" provst="" country="India" month="11" day="11" year="2008">A very beautiful hymn. The content is marvelous. Our Lord is wonderful and He is so loving that He just wants us to always speak to Him, to always converse with Him just like Moses did, conversing with Him face to face. It's true that we are forced to converse with Him when we don't know our path. It results in a journey that is an everlasting memorial between us and Him. I praise the Lord for His ways. May the Lord be merciful to us to see Him, love Him, trust Him and obey Him.</article>
	<article author="Sina Church" email="" city="Tamuning" provst="Guam" country="United States" month="11" day="10" year="2008">Beautiful song. Truly this song is so meaningful. With the Lord leading and doing what He wants in us is far better than our own. It's our complete yielding all to Him and Him alone. That way, when we falter He is there picking us up and leading on. Praise the Lord. Amen.</article>

	<article author="cristina yabut" email="" city="Makati City" provst="CBD, Makati" country="Philippines" month="10" day="25" year="2008">If God leads you to walk a way and sometimes we don't know how to, we turn to Him, we pray much and we listen to His speaking. In that way where He intends for us to walk, only He knows it, and He knows where it will go. Praise the Lord! For those in times when all around you're unsure, it adds to your faith and opens an opportunity for God to let us know Him more.</article>
