	<article author="Amy Forcadilla" email="" city="Malabon City" provst="NCR" country="Philippines" month="4" day="17" year="2011">To surrender everything to the Lord will end up our struggling in the vanity of human life. Time, life, silver, and gold are not ours but His. As Abraham willingly offered Isaac and the Father His only Begotten Son, may we also fully surrender our all to Him. Praise the Lord He is worthy to receive our all. Lord Jesus, sanctify our all unto You. Amen.</article>
	<article author="Gerald Chan" email="" city="Baguio" provst="Benguet" country="Philippines" month="4" day="3" year="2011">I love this song because it reminds me that nothing last forever. We have plans in our life, but the plan of the Lord will always prevail. We should really surrender everything that is not of Him. Our dear Lord is everything. He is the great I Am, the universality, centrality, unique Headship. Lord, I surrender all. I love You, Lord.</article>

You used to do these things in your former life, but now get rid of them all, AND SURRENDER-GIVE 'EM UP-ADMIT YOU WERE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE CONFLICT.</article>
	<article author="Anonymous" email="" city="Kuala Lumpur" provst="" country="Malaysia" month="2" day="19" year="2011">Fully surrendered: what a wonderful song. Everything is given by God, sometimes it is such a folly to think that everything belongs to me, in fact, everything belongs to God. I pray that I'll always be surrendered to You, Lord.</article>
