We're not ashamed to proclaim it. This song reminds me to the great commission that the Lord has given to us, that is, to "go forth and disciple all the nation, baptizing them into the name of the Triune God." Let us go forth and preach Christ to all the creation, proclaiming the gospel, presenting the truth and ministering life for the growth, development and manifestation of the kingdom of God.</article>
