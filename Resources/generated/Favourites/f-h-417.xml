O Lord the cross on any motive, choice, or deep desires; in our experience the only way to take our cross happens when turn to our spirit and contact the One who bore the cross...Lord, our crosses are for our transformation, restriction, limitation... thank You for each cross..let's be encouraged, a reward :) comes to those who take each cross instead of the enjoyment of our soul in this age.</article>

Yet many times His cross comes to touch something I didn't really ask for or expect, something precious in my eyes. Lord, thank You for answering my prayer in Your way.</article>
