	<article author="Rodgers Mwiinga" email="rodgersmwiinga@gmail.com" city="Lusaka" provst="" country="Zambia" month="7" day="4" year="2016">I was sinking deep in sin, Far from the peaceful show, Very deeply stained within But the master of see heard my despairing cry. The love of God is something that without divine intervention one can't understand. Imagine the time we didn't know God, the time we were wandering in sin, almost dying in sin God sent His only son from heaven to redeem us from sinking in the sea of sin. May God help us to realise his love every day.</article>
