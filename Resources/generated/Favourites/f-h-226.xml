    <article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="26" year="2008">If our spirit is focused on the bread and the cup and a prayer is offered regarding the Lord's suffering on earth, a brother should follow the prayer and the atmosphere of the meeting to select Hymns, #226, "For the bread and for the wine, / For the pledge that seals Him mine, / For the words of love divine, / We give Thee thanks, O Lord." This will bring us into the feeling of the bread and the cup. When we come to the fourth stanza, we should all stand up and prepare for the breaking of the bread. After singing, someone should offer a prayer of blessing to receive the bread and the cup from the Lord's hand.
