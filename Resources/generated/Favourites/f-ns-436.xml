    <article author="Jasmine Chan" email="gty7000@yahoo.com" city="Clarksville" provst="Maryland" country="United States" month="12" day="3" year="2013">The melody of this song just matched the lyrics. It is very soothing to the human spirit as if the Spirit of Jesus is drawing us towards His heart and guiding us to His right path. I do need to listen to His word and be thankful for being a member of His Body, with and by the peace of Christ settling in my heart and let Him be my Mediator to live the church life with all the saints for the building up of the Body of Christ for His coming back. That's the only right way to live the Body life. Stay in You and You in me, Come Lord Jesus.</article>
