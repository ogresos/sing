	<article author="David Stuart" email="" city="Gateshead" provst="Tyne &amp; Wear" country="United Kingdom" month="1" day="25" year="2012">This hymn by Horatio Bonar is taken directly from Hebrews 10 and is of great consolation to the believer as are many hymns irrespective of author.

A truly wonderful website. Thank you.</article>
	<article author="Thomas" email="" city="Trivandrum" provst="Kerala" country="India" month="12" day="19" year="2011">The complete hymn:

No blood, no altar now, The sacrifice is o'er!
No flame, no smoke ascends on high,
The lamb is slain no more,
But richer blood has flowed from nobler veins,
To purge the soul from guilt, and cleanse the reddest stains.

We thank Thee for the blood, The blood of Christ, Thy Son:
The blood by which our peace is made,
Our victory is won:
Great victory o'er hell, and sin, and woe,
That needs no second fight, and leaves no second foe.

We thank Thee for the grace, Descending from above,
That overflows our widest guilt,
The'eternal Father's love.
Love of the Father's everlasting Son,
Love of the Holy Ghost, Jehovah, Three in One.

We thank Thee for the hope, So glad, and sure, and clear;
It holds the drooping spirit up
Till the long dawn appear;
Fair hope! with what a sunshine does it cheer
Our roughest path on earth, our dreariest desert here.

We thank Thee for the crown Of glory and of life;
'Tis no poor with'ring wreath of earth,
Man's prize in mortal strife;
'Tis incorruptible as is the throne,
The kingdom of our God and His incarnate Son.</article>

We thank Thee for the grace,
Descending from above,
That overflows our widest guilt,
Eternal Father’s love.
Love of the Father’s everlasting Son
Love of the Holy Ghost, Jehovah, Three in One.

I thank God for your website.</article>

It is only by His blood that I am healed and set free. I would try to play and sing this hymn for God's glory.</article>

	<article author="Alvin Lo" email="" city="" provst="" country="Hong Kong" month="3" day="9" year="2009">There may be another hymn that describes it better, but I did have a very recent experience.
I had been in some kind of worldly entertainment since I was small. After I believed in the Lord, I stopped it for a while, but then it came back. I was tormented by it, and I couldn't stop thinking about it every day.
But a few days ago, when I had a bed-time prayer with the Lord, I realized that I need to remove that in order to sustain my fellowship with the Lord. I did not know if I had the strength to do that, and I struggled very hard. A voice in me said that I shouldn't give it up.
Finally, I applied the Lord's blood and His victory over death and sin. I called on the name of the Lord. I know that the Lord has beaten the enemy, and is able to defeat the enemy inside me. Then, without waiting for the next day, I removed everything about that entertainment, even back-up copies. I was actually singing this hymn. I couldn't believe what I did. I was experiencing the Lord's victory over the enemy.
After that I slept peacefully, knowing that I just witnessed an application of the Lord's cross, His blood, His victory on death and sin and woe, and that He bestows eternal life to us.</article>
