"The Greek word translated “LOOKING AWAY UNTO” denotes “looking with undivided attention by turning away from every other object.” As Hebrew believers---the river crossers, we had to look away from all the things in our environment—away from old religion, Judaism, and its persecution, and away from all earthly things—that we might look unto Jesus, who is now seated on the right hand of the throne of God in the heavens. Hallelujah!....... The wonderful Jesus, who is enthroned in heaven and crowned with glory and honor (Heb. 2:9), is the greatest attraction in the universe. He is like an immense magnet, drawing all His seekers to Him. It is by being attracted by His charming beauty that we LOOK AWAY from all things other than Him. Without such a charming object, how could we look away from so many distracting things on this earth? When we look away unto Jesus, we see Him, and He is infused into us. [(Conclusion of the New Testament, The (Msgs. 367-387), Chapter 14, Section 2)] Praise the Lord!</article>
