I remember Lot's wife when she took a lingering look backward at Sodom; she became a pillar of salt. Pursuing the Lord requires our forgetting the things which are behind, otherwise we will be left in shame... Lord! Have mercy on us...</article>

In pursuing Him along with the those who call on Him - His Body - we can be preserved for His glory.  Lord Jesus! May You strengthen us into our inner man...</article>
	<article author="Joey" email="" city="edmonds" provst="WA" country="United States" month="3" day="16" year="2009">I just came back from my last high school retreat and I'm just so happy that I was able to see a vision. Things wouldn't go well at school and I would face many temptations and obstacles, but the Lord will guide me through all the difficulties...All I can do is to build up the body with the saints and to enjoy Him and seek whenever I get lost. Praise You Lord and thank You for Your love...</article>
	<article author="Louis Wang" email="" city="Dallas" provst="TX" country="United States" month="12" day="21" year="2008">At the end of college, I had to make a choice between the Lord and my father's will. Eventually I obtained my medical degree but lost Him. His faithfulness brought me back to Himself nearly twenty years later. I see now that truly everything the world has to offer is dung compared to Him. He must be our central vision. Let's just love Him and gain Him!</article>

	<article author="DB" email="" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="5" day="17" year="2008">It's really comforting to hear other young people are pursuing the Lord!Sometimes it seems we are alone.At school, no one seems to be seeking Him out. 1Pet.5:8-9 says
"Be sober;watch. Your adversary, the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking someone to devour. Him withstand, being firm in your faith, knowing that the same sufferings are being accomplished among your brotherhood in the world."</article>
	<article author="David Barton" email="" city="Spanaway" provst="WA" country="United States" month="5" day="5" year="2008">I really appreciate and enjoy this song because regardless of your situation we can so simply just press on and stretch forth to gain the wonderful Christ the supreme vision. This is such a wonderful reality to be able to stretch forward not only forgetting the things behind (which in my case is a tremendous mercy) but more so to gain Christ!!!! Praise the Lord</article>
	<article author="Jotham Chang" email="" city="" provst="" country="Singapore" month="12" day="8" year="2007">I listen to this song whenever I have troubles. We can really use this song to pray and exercise our spirit. "Forgetting the things which are behind! Press on, pursue with this mind! By any means, each hour now redeem! Stretch forth, lay hold of Him!!!!!!!!!!</article>
	<article author="Ben" email="" city="" provst="" country="Canada" month="1" day="21" year="2006">Brothers and sisters. We are Lord's expressions and His chosen people, so we should preach gospel all the time. For me, I used to preach online and at my school. I'm a student too. but since we have gift from God, we should use it and share it with another people. We should carry out the gospel to everyone. In the Bible, it also say—when gospel preached unto all the nations, the end shall come!! Brothers and sisters, we should all have a heart to preach, to speak the word of God. Don't forget we are all prophets, even a 10 yrs old kid if he received the Lord. Everyone who receives the gift from the Lord becomes a prophet and priest..not just those offical priests. We are all priests, that's why God chose us to express Him.</article>
	<article author="Alice Ding" email="" city="Toronto" provst="ON" country="Canada" month="1" day="3" year="2003">We need to forget the things that are behind and enjoy Him in a fresh new way! Also we need count ALL THINGS loss for Him, but just GAIN Him, OBTAIN Him, and LAY HOLD of Him because CHRIST IS THE CENTRAL VISION! The Lord is rich and new so we need to enjoy Him in different ways! And not only persuing and knowing Him, but being FOUND in Him!!

AMEN! He is our center and reality! So love Him with our WHOLE being!</article>
	<article author="Julia Monica Hernandez" email="" city="Arlington" provst="TX" country="U.S.A." month="11" day="18" year="2002">Because I really need this pursuing of the Lord in my life. Not only knowing Him but be found in Him.</article>
