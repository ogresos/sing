The words are deep and make us understand that in all our circumstances - whether in joy or pain, we have to praise our Maker. The hosts of God will still dwell with us as we are just and we obey Him. In all situations, He is with us and as we obey Him and delight in His service, our wants will surely be His cares. What a blessed assurance!!</article>

It is a constant reminder to us that GOD is a GOD of comfort and a surcease in time of trials and tribulations.
