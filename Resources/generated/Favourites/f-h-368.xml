I can confess that my heart often wavers, repent that I love other things, and simply turn to Him! Especially the line "on bended knee" reminds me that I need such a desperation to love the Lord with more love. He knows my true heart, and I simply come to Him as I am!</article>

It surely has stirred up in me a love for the Lord. I got to know of this hymn through reading a ministry book of Witness Lee, he shared, "We need to love the Lord more, and we need to help others to love and seek the Lord more. Then the Holy Spirit will have the ground in us to bring us on and to apply to us everything that God has accomplished for His eternal purpose." 
Lord we praise You and ask, "More love to Thee."</article>

In such stage of grief and agony, yet she could sing " More Love to Thee!"  Oh, how much we need to love Him More even when we are going through the valley of shadow of death! Hallelujah! Christ is still the Victor!</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="9" day="21" year="2013">Elizabeth Payson Prentiss (1818-1878) came from a Godly home. Her father, Edward Payson, was a brilliant Bible teacher and a loving father. Her husband, a gifted Presbyterian minister later became a seminary professor. But despite her many blessings, Prentiss' life was not easy. She suffered from severe headaches and chronic insomnia. One of her children suddenly died, and a short time later a 2nd child died. At this, Prentiss cried in anguish, "Our home is broken up, our lives wrecked, our hopes shattered, our dreams dissolved. I don't think I can stand living for another moment."
In her room with a Bible and hymnal in hand, she sought comfort. She stopped at Sarah Adams' hymn "Nearer, My God, to Thee" and read it several times. As she prayed, words came to her: "More Love to Thee, O Christ." - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton
---------------------
The original says "O Christ" instead of "O Lord" throughout. Other than that this is the complete original hymn. Many hymnals leave out stanza 3, and some change stanza 3 to not allude to death.</article>
	<article author="Hymnal.net" city="" provst="" country="" month="6" day="18" year="2013">If we keep a time for morning revival with a heart that genuinely loves the Lord, many things will follow. If we draw near to the Lord every morning, He will not let us go. He will not allow us to be an inappropriate or improper Christian. The Lord will thoroughly inquire about everything in our being; He will not cease until we are fully subdued. If we genuinely practice morning revival, we will have new knowledge, new discoveries, new visions, and new revelations concerning the Lord; we will also receive new dealings from the Lord. This is the meaning of meeting the Lord and touching Him. After He deals with us, He will give us a commission and a burden, and this burden will become our mission. A burden is a heavy weight within that presses us down and does not let us go so that we have no peace until we carry out God's charge. Those who meet the Lord receive burdens.

Pursuing to know the Lord, fellowshipping with Him, and preaching the gospel must not become regulations to keep. Please do not consider this fellowship as a doctrine. Rather, we should respond in love to the Lord because we have been attracted by His love. May we all have the prayer of Hymns, #368: "More love to Thee, O Lord, / More love to Thee! / Hear Thou the prayer I make / On bended knee; / This is my earnest plea: / More love, O Lord, to Thee, / More love to Thee, / More love to Thee!" May the Lord grant such hunger and desperation to motivate us to draw near to Him. If we do not draw near to Him, we will be hungry and thirsty within, and we will not be able to go on or be satisfied. If we rise up early to draw near to the Lord daily, the Lord will meet us. We will have new discoveries of the Lord and receive many dealings in His hand. If we pass through these dealings in His presence, we will receive a burden for His work. Then others will not need to beg us to preach the gospel, because we will be burdened for the gospel and also compelled to preach the gospel.

We should go to the Lord and tell Him, "Lord, cause me to love You more." Stanza 1 of Hymns, #368 says, "More love to Thee, O Lord, / More love to Thee! / Hear Thou the prayer I make / On bended knee; / This is my earnest plea: / More love, O Lord, to Thee, / More love to Thee, / More love to Thee!" We need to love the Lord more, and we need to help others to love and seek the Lord more. Then the Holy Spirit will have the ground in us to bring us on and to apply to us everything that God has accomplished for His eternal purpose.
