	<article author="Member in the Body" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="8" day="11" year="2016">Our costly and valuable spiritual treasure is a gift from the Lord after paying a great price "without money" and willing to give it back to Him if He asks for it. Remember Abraham and Isaac?</article>

	<article author="William Jeng" email="willjeng@gmail.com" city="Irvine" provst="CA" country="United States" month="3" day="26" year="2016">This song reminded me of my favorite footnote, from Matthew 8:26 -
"The disciples considered Mary's love offering to the Lord a waste. Throughout the past twenty centuries thousands of precious lives, heart treasures, high positions, and golden futures have been "wasted" upon the Lord Jesus. To those who love Him in such a way He is altogether lovely and worthy of their offering. What they have poured upon Him is not a waste but a fragrant testimony of His sweetness."
Lord, this is my consecration to You.
I love You Lord. I willingly waste myself upon You.</article>

We are not wasting our life while serving the Lord, it's most valuable heavenly thing.
I'm Shu, 26 now, accomodating in Matsudo, Japan.
I'm originally from Shanghai, China... but I am not good at speaking a kind of Standard Chinese.</article>

	<article author="Rebecca" email="" city="" provst="" country="Taiwan" month="11" day="26" year="2013">I still remember that training in Anaheim, brother asked us all (the young people) to stand up and sing this banner song, and asked the elders to pray for us while we were singing.
It truly touched my heart, and made me consecrate myself to my dear Lord.</article>

Господа Иисуса первой любовью,
Мы изливали на Него
Самое драгоценное для нас,
Даже самое дорогое и ценное
Духовное сокровище,
Ценное духовное сокровище, «растрачивая»
Себя на Него, на Него.
