(Refrain)
By and by, when the morning comes,
When the saints of God are gathered home,
We’ll tell the story how we’ve overcome,
For we’ll understand it better by and by.

Often when adopting and adapting a hymn from Christianity, the Chinese translator made significant improvement over the original lyrics. In this hymn the famous notion of "by and by" is replaced by the immediate present enjoyment of God's grace at the house of God, which is not the heavenly mansion in the by and by, but rather, the church as Body of Christ in this age, right now.</article>

Praise the Lord. God loves and welcomes His children home. It's peaceful to meet God, to have our face shining brightly. The Spirit is so powerful. Keep singing; never stop. Let God's children be happy and so peaceful.</article>
