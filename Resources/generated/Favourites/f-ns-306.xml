I enjoy so much singing it with the saints when we come together to feast with Him at His Table! What a wonderful Shepherd and Overseer of our souls we have, caring for all our needs, bringing us back to Him when we like sheep stray, and causing us to shepherd and feed others as He so personally shepherds our inner person. Praise Him!</article>
