We as saints of Christ need to really hunger and thirst more for Jesus till he comes.
The melody is so sweet, I will play it over and over. God Bless!</article>

I really like this song. It is very rich and encourages me to eat and drink more of the Lord. My satisfaction is to eat and drink the Lord every day. I'm very hungry and thirsty. I thank the Lord for drawing me. My need is to chew on the Lord, to be constituted in me, that I will be useful and cooperate with Him in His move on this earth. Amen.</article>
