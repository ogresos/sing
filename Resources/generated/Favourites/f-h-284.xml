 მასზე შეყვარებული ,
მადლით ვსუნთქავ სიყვარულს, უფალი რომ მასწავლის 
ოჰ , ეს სრული სიმშვიდე ,ღვთაებრივი გზავნილი,
ამ უშრეტ სიყვარლში,
მე მისი ვარ, ის ჩემი 
ზეცა მკრთალი ლურჯია ,
მიწა მწვანედ ბიბინებს,
 სიცოცხლის ელფერი აქვს დედამიწის კიდურებს 
ჩიტები მხიარულობენ,ვარდების რიგს გავყვები ,
მას შემდეგ რაც მას ვიცნობ,მე მისი ვარ ,ის ჩემი</article>

	<article author="Clay Mile" email="cmile@sasktel.net" city="Regina" provst="Saskatchewan" country="Canada" month="5" day="13" year="2015">Such a beautiful expression of biblical truths and of the marvellous experience of the new birth and of the confidence and peace consequent to a deepening faith in biblical doctrines of grace, election, and God's sovereignty and faithfulness.</article>
	<article author="Brian Wilfred" email="brianwilfred@yahoo.com" city="Johannesburg" provst="" country="South Africa" month="4" day="4" year="2015">A wonderful and inspirational hymn that gives mankind insight to the kind of deep love Jesus have for us.</article>
	<article author="Iniabasi  Okulaja" email="okulajaini@yahoo.com" city="Abuja" provst="" country="Nigeria" month="4" day="3" year="2015">This showcases the love that Jesus has for us. Very comforting to know that nothing can separate us from His love. We are safe sound and secure in His everlasting arms. Thank You Jesus.</article>
	<article author="Bukky Olaoye" email="olaoyebukky@gmail.com" city="Atlanta" provst="GA" country="United States" month="11" day="24" year="2014">Wow, how comforting, and reassuring!! The warmth of God's love is so unmatchable!!
Thank God for the heart that composed this song!</article>
	<article author="Steven Seeley" email="stevenedwardseeley@gmail.com" city="Moody" provst="Alabama" country="United States" month="8" day="18" year="2014">I fear the grand old didactic hymns are rapidly falling out of favor being replaced by mantras with less depth of meaning. I hope I am not being uncharitable. For no particular reason this hymn popped in my head today. A blessed truth.</article>
	<article author="Brian and Christine Treharne" email="treharne2@gmail.com" city="Ivybridge" provst="Devon" country="United Kingdom" month="8" day="13" year="2014">We were walking part of the SouthWest coast path this morning between Cawsand and Cremyll near where the Pilgrim Fathers set off for America and as we came to a welcoming seat we found that it had been dedicated to a loved one with the following words,' Heaven above is softer blue; Earth: around is sweeter green: Something lives in every hue, Christless .eyes have never seen. It perfectly described the scene before us and our Christian experience.
Unfortunately, we began arguing over the right tune and hastened to the internet as soon as we got home! I was right! Now I can't get it out of my head but who would want to? Lovely moments which enhanced our day.</article>
	<article author="Jack Corbin Getz" email="jackgetzmail@gmail.com" city="Tucker" provst="Georgia" country="United States" month="3" day="2" year="2014">It's been my favorite for many years. As an artist I love the second verse especially. It's worth savoring...all of it.</article>
	<article author="Tudor Matthew" email="bethel.temple@hotmail.com" city="Benidorm" provst="Alicante" country="Spain" month="12" day="4" year="2013">I heard this lovely ANOINTED Hymn this Morning. We used to sing it in ELIM CHURCH in PONTYPRIDD South Wales in the 1940s &amp; 1950s.
I felt The LORD JESUS say to me today, YOU ARE MINE AND I AM YOURS.
Despite failing Him many times, and sometimes not sensing Gods presence, HE STILL REMAINS FAITHFUL TO US.
On hearing this lovely Hymn again, after so many years, The Holy Spirit spoke so clearly and with CERTAINTY to me, that I AM HIS AND HE IS MINE.</article>
	<article author="Frederick Ellis" email="freddiejimi@yahoo.com" city="Columbus" provst="Ohio" country="United States" month="11" day="23" year="2013">Old hymns are good and very inspiring to the soul when you begin to reflect God's unfeigned love, nothing takes away the joy that comes from the Holy Spirit. We need more hymns of yester years than the rock n' roll of today's gospel rock.</article>
	<article author="Hannah" email="h.gottschalk@sky.com" city="Wanstead" provst="London" country="United Kingdom" month="9" day="30" year="2013">I woke up this morning with this hymn in my heart. I have not heard for years and feel the essence in my heart just made to search for the words because I know my Lord Jesus through the Lord Holy Spirit telling me how much He loves me. What excellent and reassuring words to know our Lord's love never ceases. Thank you for timeless word - worth hearing it again and again to remind me of how much to cost Christ Jesus to purchase my redemption. Thank you so much for I know Jesus is mine and I am His.</article>
	<article author="Ruth Bushnell" email="ruth.bushnell@lineone.net" city="Loughborough" provst="Leicestershire" country="United Kingdom" month="9" day="22" year="2013">Have just finished reading Francine Rivers book 'Redeeming love' and found myself singing this hymn. Like so many others haven't heard if for years but the truth contained in it is amazing! I am His and He is mine. Wonderful!</article>
	<article author="Richard Wilson" email="rwcon@chariot.net.au" city="One Tree Jill" provst="South Australia" country="Australia" month="8" day="23" year="2013">Just sitting this morning and the words to this wonderful song came back to me.
So I went looking and found the rest of them here. Thanks!

It was a song very special to me early in my journey with Jesus and as I look at it again it is totally relevant to where He brought me right now.
It is such a succinct summing up of the heart of the Good News and the amazing grace of God who is love.</article>
	<article author="John Masters" email="johnmasters2003@yahoo.co.uk" city="Neath" provst="Wales" country="United Kingdom" month="7" day="19" year="2013">For some reason, I picked up my old guitar this morning and began to sing this song which I have not heard sung since 1980. I looked up the words on this site and reminded myself of the unfailing love and grace of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. 
'Many there be which say of my soul, "There is no hope for him in God"; But Thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head. (Psalm 3:2-3)</article>
	<article author="Colin Rookwood" email="colinrookwood120@btinternet.com" city="Sale" provst="Cheshire" country="United Kingdom" month="3" day="23" year="2013">I awoke thinking of the words and music of this hymn today, Saturday 23rd March 2013. It reminded me of when as a newly converted 20-year-old Christian in 1960 I used to love to sing these words. At the time they seemed to have such meaning and truth which gladdened my heart. I still think they are wonderful, plus the tune, and I commend them to others to sing as an outpouring of a grateful heart to God for the way He gives us new eyes to see the beauty of His creation, and reassures us of His undeserved love and mercy in Christ.</article>
	<article author="Rishie" email="rishie@dodo.com.au" city="Glen Innes" provst="Nsw" country="Australia" month="1" day="16" year="2013">I have never heard this hymn before but it's beautiful. The words are so beautiful, and rich with truth. I am His and He is mine and nothing on earth can take me away from Him! I can rest in Him despite the failures and disappointments and heartbreak of life.  I really liked Isaiah's comments, they expressed how I felt as well.
Whoever is playing the piano for these hymns is very gifted, that would not be an easy one to play because of the chromatics yet it's done very well. 
Thank you to the makers of this site, for collecting and sharing all this beautiful music with us!</article>
	<article author="Jenny Bohns" email="" city="Harker Heights" provst="Texas" country="United States" month="11" day="16" year="2012">I first came across the second verse while reading "Shadow of the Almighty" by Elizabeth Elliot and didn't know it was a hymn. However, it perfectly described the instant I was saved. I walked outside and everything was so beautiful to me! I love this hymn!</article>
	<article author="John Duncan Young" email="" city="Dalkeith" provst="Midlothian" country="United Kingdom" month="2" day="8" year="2012">Ever since my conversion to the Lord Jesus Christ, this song has been my theme. It describes my conversion experience, especially verse two. Many modern songs encourage, but, the older songs were born out of real change of life styles, from sin to salvation through the death and resurrection of God's Son, Jesus Christ. The alternative tune is good too.</article>
	<article author="Dick" email="" city="Phoenix" provst="AZ" country="United States" month="11" day="24" year="2011">I first heard this hymn when I was a freshman in Bible College in 1958, but hadn't sung it for many decades. For some reason I awakened this morning (Thanksgiving Day) and it was running through my mind. I'd forgotten all but snippets of the lyrics, so googled it and found your site. My favorite line is "As long as God and I shall be, I am His and He is mine." That covers it all, doesn't it? Thanks for including it on your website.</article>
	<article author="Livingston Pan" email="" city="" provst="" country="Canada" month="11" day="11" year="2011">LOVELY!!</article>
	<article author="Margaret Hutchison" email="" city="Sydney" provst="NSW" country="Australia" month="8" day="12" year="2011">When I first encountered this lovely hymn and came to the second verse I was startled. It perfectly describes what I experienced when I became a Christian (at age 13). It has always been a favourite for me, but is not contained in many hymn books these days so thank you for having the lyrics and music available on your site.</article>
	<article author="Andrew" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="6" day="6" year="2011">What a hymn!</article>
	<article author="Mac An Rothaich" email="" city="Saskatoon" provst="Saskatchewan" country="Canada" month="1" day="14" year="2010">I really appreciate your site! I am in the process of learning a new hymn a month and this was my first. No one I knew could tell me how it goes and I do not read music (it is all by ear for me) so I really appreciated your site's lyric list and audio!</article>
	<article author="Sharon Steen" email="" city="Colorado Springs" provst="CO" country="United States" month="12" day="18" year="2009">Our 33 year old daughter has been told that she is at risk for "sudden cardiac death". The LORD is comforting me greatly through His Word and hymns, this being one of them! He brings peace, perspective, and even joy in the midst of our heart wrenching situation.</article>
	<article author="Isaiah Tor" email="" city="Sydney" provst="NSW" country="Australia" month="10" day="9" year="2008">The atmosphere this hymn conveys is of a loving relationship with Christ, characterised by the most immediate and intimate sentiment and feeling in spirit, with a heart that affords the Lord a way to fully envelop one's being with that precious love and grace that is Himself. The rest here is not occasioned by outward circumstances of rest, but rather despite the "wild alarms", we are in His everlasting arms, enfolded in His rest. Despite creation and all its elements subjected to the slavery of corruption, heaven and earth becomes so pleasing to us when our vision and apprehension is so characterised and saturated by the presence of His endearing love. And most of all, despite the fleeting nature of all things that we currently perceive as established, the Lord's love brings us in absolute, eternal and unchanging union with Him. Most of all we know in this progressively deep loving union with the Lord: "I am His and He is mine".</article>
	<article author="William Fox" email="" city="York" provst="North Yorshire" country="United Kingdom" month="6" day="27" year="2008">I rather like this. In the text there does not seem to be a refrain as there is in the music. The music is full of romantic chromatacism which I rather like. I think that it is simply super that on this site it is possible to download the music too. Well done hymnal.net!</article>
	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="11" day="19" year="2010">It is of the Lord's sovereignty that the Song of Songs is included in the Scriptures. However, some so-called Christians disagree with the inclusion of Song of Songs in the Bible, viewing it as a secular book, not as a sacred one. But in fact Song of Songs is the most sacred of books. In this book the seeker says, "I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine" (6:3). If we did not have Song of Songs, we probably could not have such an expression regarding our relationship with the Lord. The hymn "Loved with everlasting love" has a line in the chorus which says, "I am His, and He is mine." This is a reference to Song of Songs. To say that "I am my beloved's" does not mean that He is the Master possessing us as His servants. It means that we are His love. This relationship is not that between master and slave, but the affectionate relationship between husband and wife. Song of Songs is the most romantic book ever written. Yet this book is concerned with the loving relationship between God and His chosen people. It presents a portrait of the married life of Christ and those who love Him.
