	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="2" day="3" year="2013">The prolific British hymnwriter Frances Ridley Havergal wrote this hymn on 2/4/1874. "I went for a little visit of 5 days to Areley House," she explained. "There were 10 persons in the house, some unconverted and long prayed for, some converted but not rejoicing Christians. He gave me the prayer, 'Lord, give me all in this house!' And He just did. Before I left the house, everyone had got a blessing. The last night of my visit I was too happy to sleep, and passed most of the night in praise and renewal of my own consecration, and these little couplets formed themselves and chimed in my heart one after another, till they finished with 'Ever, only, ALL for Thee.'" As Frances wrote the words she capitalized ALL. 
Two months earlier, she had made a complete surrender of herself to Christ and experienced "the blessedness of true consecration." She wrote, "I just yielded myself to Him, and utterly trusted Him to keep me." - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>
