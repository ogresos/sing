    <article author="Isaiah Tor" city="Sydney" provst="NSW" country="Australia" month="8" day="6" year="2008">This hymn speaks of an intimacy with the Lord which points to the fullest degree of onenesss where the Lord in His innermost being will overshadow us, even incorporate us into Himself in and as the New Jerusalem. This hymn portrays the scene, the sentiment, the feeling, the rich apprehension of the Lord Jesus found in 2 Corinthians 3:18.</article>
