	<article author="Igor Savinkin" email="igor.savinkin@gmail.com" city="Kaliningrad" provst="" country="Russia" month="1" day="17" year="2013">I do want the Lord to deepen the flow of His life in me, the very essence of His being. Yet I realise, the increase of the divine flow in me is in proportion to me losing my soul-life. "LORD, cause me to desire to lose my soul life for the flow to deepen in me. This flow is ultimately not for myself but for the Body of Christ, for the bridal army to come to the full manifestation. LORD, do it.</article>

	<article author="H" email="" city="SF" provst="CA" country="United States" month="2" day="3" year="2012">One of my favorite hymns. God is Triune so He can flow into us. The shortage is that we don't enjoying God's flowing enough. "Lord, deepen the pure flow of life." May we learn to echo this hymn as our prayer back to Him.</article>

	<article author="Jason Au" email="" city="Anaheim" provst="California" country="United States" month="5" day="30" year="2011">I really like this song, and I really appreciate the person who wrote this song even more. This song brings me to tears sometimes. It is very sweet and lovely.

The sweet flow of life. The "pom pom pom". The divine transmission between the Creator and the created. The very reason for this universe. The divine romance between God and man. It's finally coming to terms with what is real in this universe.</article>
	<article author="Berean Steward II" email="" city="Columbus" provst="North Dakota" country="United States" month="3" day="27" year="2011">I love this hymn too. The melody fits the well written lyrics. It is important to compose hymns and spiritual songs with melody as the Apostle Paul tells us to do, and not with rock music beat. Melody should always be at the forefront of all of our composing, playing and singing. The Greek word for melody is psallo, which means melody or psalming.

"...but be filled with the Spirit; speaking to yourselves in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord..." (Eph. 5:18b-19).

More than any other verse in the Bible, I have pray-read Rev. 22:1 a myriad of times. This verse speaks of this wonderful pure flow of the river of water of life. "And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb" (Rev. 22:1).</article>
	<article author="Ria" email="" city="Toronto" provst="Ontario" country="Canada" month="5" day="1" year="2010">I was struck by the contrast of this hymn and the original words to the same tune - The Old Rugged Cross. "From my spirit within " is a striking contrast to, "On a hill far away". One is so subjective and the other so objective. One speaks of judicial redemption and the other organic salvation."</article>

	<article author="Elisabeth" email="" city="pleasant hill" provst="ca" country="United States" month="7" day="24" year="2008">In the flow we are perfectly blessed! I was caused again to appreciate this hymn by listening to the last message of the 2007 summer training - we have the Triune God - the Father, Son, and Spirit - flowing within us! How we need to open to this flowing!!! Lord Jesus, continue flowing to the brothers and sisters for all of our time here!!!</article>
	<article author="F&amp;R" email="" city="" provst="" country="Philippines" month="6" day="3" year="2005">Oh! How sweet to stay in the flow. In the flow we have the triune God flowing richly. And the Triune God is flowing free. All we need is just to open ourselves and enjoy the Triune God in our SPIRIT!!!!</article>
	<article author="April" email="" city="OKC" provst="" country="U.S.A." month="11" day="25" year="2004">I love this song because it reminds me of the precious sweet flow of life that I have come to experience and enjoy by being with the saints. Oh Lord, deepen the sweet flow of life! Keep us in this sweet flow of life!</article>
	<article author="Joy Kim" email="" city="Fullerton" provst="CA" country="U.S.A." month="8" day="16" year="2003">I enjoy the line "abide, you're a branch in the vine" from this hymn. A branch of a vine does not struggle to grow, nor to know something, nor to analyze its growth. It simply remains in the life flow and GROWS. All the vine must pay attention to doing is to make sure that it stays in the life flow. That is the only work we as branches in the True Vine should do. "No more struggle and strain; all self effort is vain; in the flow I am perfectly blessed." Too often I struggle to be a certain kind of Christian or a certain kind of church kid and sister. What I don't realize is that my struggling is blocking the life flow! It is this very life flow that will spontaneously cause me to be the Christian I struggled to be. We simply must hold to the fact that we are branches in the vine and by faith enjoy the flow in which we are blessed. "Lord, I treasure the sweet flow of life! O Lord, deepen the pure flow of life!"</article>
