Experience God by reading New Testament Bible and finding a good Bible believing or evangelical church in your area. E.g Elim, RCCG, Holy Trinity, Hill Song, an Anglican Church. Christianity will begin to make sense to you in Jesus Name.</article>

	<article author="Janet" email="viola11@virginmedia.com" city="Leicester" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="6" day="2" year="2015">I don't understand Christianity AT all. It simply doesn't make sense to me. I don't particularly like church. But that doesn't mean that I go around doing bad things. Someone can be an atheist and still be a good person. I call myself an agnostic.</article>

	<article author="Stella Olarewaju" email="mayowauk@yahoo.com" city="London" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="3" day="9" year="2015">I love this song because it shows how Jesus brings salvation to mankind. Only in the mentioning of the name JESUS can all the power of darkness bow. More of Jesus will bring light into the heart, whereby the right steps in the right direction is taken. More of Jesus in the heart and NOT in the head, will guide leaders of all nations to do the right thing by their subjects. More of Jesus will counsel world leaders to seek the reliability of safety of their respective nation with LOVE and UNDERSTANDING. More of JESUS will make us to dwell together in PEACE and harmony rarher than war and terrorism. More of JESUS will point us towards ETERNITY in heaven, where we shall ever dwell with GOD the father, SON and the HOLY SPIRIT. Amen.</article>

	<article author="Onesmus" email="mziwanda.obanda@ymail.com" city="Nairobi" provst="" country="" month="5" day="21" year="2014">This evening, on work at 6.30 pm. I am reading the Bible on my computer the book of Isaiah 53, meditating the word of God. Oh I just felt that I need God more and more, to know Him and to commit to His will. I bent down and whispered a prayer (just whispered so as not to cause commotion with my colleagues) but for sure I did pray fervently!
Then the Spirit of God sang to me the Swahili version of the song "More about Jesus" and I wanted to sing with Him, so I went to the internet. Not knowing that the music was to accompany the lyrics!
I am indeed blessed beyond words! More of His love who died for me! 
I vow that I will commit to the ultimate will of my Father! God bless all!</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="8" day="24" year="2013">Eliza Hewitt wrote this hymn as she was studying the promises of God that had been fulfilled in Jesus Christ. The more she studied, the more excited she became as she saw Scripture fulfilled in every aspect of Christ's life. All of Scripture, she discovered, focused on Jesus Christ.
It is especially significant that Hewitt was so faithfully seeking God at this point in her life. At the time, she was recovering from a severe spinal injury. A school teacher, Hewitt had been struck with a heavy slate by one of her students.
Hewitt was never again able to teach in the public schools, but she continued to be involved with Sunday school. There she was able to combine the 2 great loves of her life: children and Jesus. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>

Once I got connected with Jesus, even though He satisfied me and took care of my needs, I can't get enough of Him! It is a precious blessing to hunger and thirst after Him!
