1. Life eternal brings us
   Fellowship of life,
   Fellowship in Spirit,
   Saving us from strife.

6. Fellowship is deepened
   Thru the cross of death;
   Fellowship is lifted
   By the Spirit's breath.

We also need to see that our human spirit is related to the fellowship. With the divine fellowship of God's life, three things are involved: the Spirit of God, our human spirit, and the cross...

    <article author="Hymnal.Net" month="3" day="24" year="2008">[Verse 6] says that our fellowship is deepened through the cross. Without the cross, our fellowship is superficial. The cross of death deepens our fellowship, and the Spirit's breath as the resurrection uplifts our fellowship. Fellowship frees us from our sinful self through the cross. Without the cross, there is no release, freedom, or liberty from the self. In the previous message, we pointed out that hymn #737 speaks of the divine fellowship and its relationship with the Spirit and the cross. Without the Spirit and the cross, we cannot have real fellowship.
