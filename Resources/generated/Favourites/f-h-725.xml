	<article author="June Christie" email="mjchristie@blueyonder.co.uk" city="London" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="1" day="26" year="2015">The 'freedom' we think we have outside of Christ is a lie of the evil one and the deceiving world. To be captured by Christ, to be 'in Him' is the true and real freedom for the soul. Those who 'know' Him and therefore love Him, 'would not go out free', for we love, we love our master and will not go out free. Thank the Lord for the cage of His love.</article>
	<article author="Pastor Robert Turton III" email="gospelworkers@aol.com" city="Hightstown" provst="NJ" country="United States" month="2" day="11" year="2013">The preaching theme for our Sunday evening service on 17 February 2013 in our 173-year-old Fresh Ponds Chapel near Dayton, NJ, is on "Walls, Windows, and Doors in the Bible," with three of our members giving the homilies. We have some hymns that refer to windows and doors, but could not think of one that mentions "walls," so I typed this question into the search section wherein we discovered one not known to us: "Strong Are the Walls Around Me," which we plan on including in the meeting this Sunday. Thank you for this opportunity.</article>
