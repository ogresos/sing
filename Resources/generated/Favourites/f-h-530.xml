	<article author="Joyce Gibson" email="joho52@yahoo.com" city="Prescott" provst="AR" country="United States" month="7" day="31" year="2014">I was raised on this song. It was beautiful then when we sang it in church services, in the field chopping/picking cotton, gardening (my mother and my grandmother), or just sitting on the porch on a quiet summer's day. I am 67 and I often fall asleep singing, humming or thinking this song. Blessed to have it in my heart.</article>

I listened wholeheartedly to it in the still small hours of the day. What a comfort and exhortation, the whole hymn is, especially in the 3rd verse, "And true to Him I'll be", which is my commitment! As I am now traveling in this wonderful world of His "when life's fleeting days shall end", verse 4 is my comfort. I thank my Lord for Will L. Thompson for such a lovely hymn.</article>
