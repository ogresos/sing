    <article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="31" year="2008">We need to realize that if the Triune God had not been processed, He could not have an expression on this earth. About two thousand years ago, the Triune God became flesh (John 1:14). Hymns, #1017 says, "Christ has put on human nature and become a man like me,/He has died upon the cross that I from Adam might be free,/He has risen and as Spirit He has come to live in me/That He might be my life." After Christ comes into us as life, He begins to spread in us for His expression. Glory is God expressed.
