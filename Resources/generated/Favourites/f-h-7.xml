	<article author="Ron" email="" city="Madison" provst="MS" country="United States" month="10" day="5" year="2012">I like the original lyrics, there is so much biblical truth packed into just a few short verses, We sing this hymn quite often at our church and with a little spirited accompaniment from the pianist it is enjoyed by young and old alike. But most of all we hope by our Father Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ. 
Here are the complete lyrics: 
When I saw the cleansing fountain
Open wide for all my sin,
I obeyed the Spirit’s wooing,
When He said, “Wilt thou be clean?”
Refrain
I will praise Him! I will praise Him!
Praise the Lamb for sinners slain;
Give Him glory, all ye people,
For His blood can wash away each stain.
Though the way seems straight and narrow,
All I claimed was swept away;
My ambitions, plans and wishes,
At my feet in ashes lay.
Refrain
Then God’s fire upon the altar
Of my heart was set aflame;
I shall never cease to praise Him
Glory, glory to His Name!
Refrain
Blessèd be the Name of Jesus!
I’m so glad He took me in;
He’s forgiven my transgressions,
He has cleansed my heart from sin.
Refrain
Glory, glory to the Father!
Glory, glory to the Son!
Glory, glory to the Spirit!
Glory to the Three in One!</article>

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="5" day="16" year="2008">To know the hymns we have to know some of the crucial points of the contents of the hymns. First, we must know some of the hymns on the blessing and experience of the Triune God. The word blessing is used here not to refer to the good things the Triune God has given us but to the praise, the blessing, we offer to Him. An example of a good hymn on the blessing of the Triune God is #7—"Glory, glory, to the Father!"—and an example of a good hymn on the experience of the Triune God is #608—"What mystery, the Father, Son, and Spirit." We also need to know hymns in the categories of the praise of the Father and the praise of the Lord.
