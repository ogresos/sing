Arise and open up our heart, Christ will come in and life to us impart, arise and open up our mouth, joined to the praise and let the spirit out. Oh, praise the Lord, brothers and sisters. Amen.</article>

Let us open up our heart and open up our mouth. Call on His name "O LORD JESUS". He is Lord of all and rich to all who call upon Him (Romans 10:12b). 
When we call on Him, the Spirit who raise Him from the death will move, annoint and supply us with resurrection life to further the process of our designation as the sons of God.</article>

(e.g. if we are so lazy to stand up early in the morning for the Lord) Everyday is a new start. The mercies and compassion of the Lord are new every morning. We need to be revived by exercising our spirits and having daily morning revival. Dear saints, ARISE! ARISE!</article>
