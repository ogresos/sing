Benjamin Schmolck was the son of a Lutheran pastor in Silesia (now Poland). After graduating from University, he returned to help his father, and 4 years later was ordained as his assistant. The next year he married and was appointed diaconus of the Friedenskirche at Schweidnitz in Silesia. 
As the result of the Counter-Reformation in Silesia, the churches in the principality of Schweidnitz had been taken from the Lutherans, and for the whole district the Peace of Westphalia (1648) allowed only one church which the Lutherans had to build outside the walls of the town; and the three clergy attached to this church had to minister to a population scattered over some thirty-six villages, and were moreover hampered by many restrictions, e.g. being unable to communicate a sick person without a permit from the local Roman Catholic priest. Here Schmolck remained till the close of his life. Probably as the result of his exhausting labors he had a stroke of paralysis in 1730 at age 58, which for a time laid him aside altogether, and after which he never recovered the use of his right hand. For five years more he was still able to officiate, preaching for the last time in 1735. But two more strokes of paralysis followed, and then cataract came on, relieved for a time by a successful operation, but returning again incurably. For the last months of his life he was confined to bed, till the message of release came to him, on the anniversary of his wedding, Feb. 12, 1737.
Schmolck was well known in his own district as a popular and useful preacher, a diligent pastor, and a man of wonderful tact and discretion. It was however his devotional books, and the original hymns therein contained, that brought him into wider popularity, and carried his name and fame all over Germany. He is the author of some 900 hymns, which range over the whole field of churchly, family, and individual life. Those in his first three collections are decidedly the best. A deep and genuine personal religion, and a fervent love to the Savior, inspire his best hymns; and as they are not simply thought out but felt, they come from the heart to the heart. The best of them are also written in a clear, flowing, forcible, natural, popular style, and abound in memorable sayings. - Dictionary of Hymnology by John Julian

There is an additional stanza, usually omitted, following the 1st stanza above:
1b. My Jesus, as Thou wilt! 
If needy here and poor,
Give me Thy peopleâ€™s bread, 
their portion rich and sure.
The manna of Thy Word 
Let my soul feed upon;
And if all else should fail, 
my Lord, thy will be done.

Last stanza, 5th line, originally says:
