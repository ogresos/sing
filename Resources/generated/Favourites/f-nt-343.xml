	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="26" year="2008">Someone wrote a hymn with the following lines: "There is sunshine in my soul today,/More glorious and bright/Than glows in any earthly sky,/For Jesus is my light" (Hymns, #343). After we are regenerated, we enjoy Christ as our light. After the third day, there were the sun, the moon, and the stars on the fourth day. After we have been regenerated, we have Christ as the sun shining within us to make us as the moon reflecting the light of the sun and to make us the shining stars. The fourth-day lights are the sun, the moon, and the stars. In the first chapter of Genesis the believers are typified by the stars (v. 16c). Daniel 12:3 says that those who turn many to righteousness shine like stars. In Revelation, the messengers of the churches, the spiritual ones who bear the responsibility of the testimony of Jesus, are the shining stars (1:16, 20; 2:1; 3:1). The church is typified by the moon in Genesis 1 (v. 16b), and Christ is typified by the sun, the greatest light bearer (v. 16a). Just as the moon is the reflection of the sun, so the church is the reflection of Christ. This typifies Christ with His Body, including all the members.
