But until now this is still my consecration song.. "Lord, though how many years have passed, though how things have changed, good and bad, one after another. Lord, do keep our love for You. It's Your mercy and Your love that we can give ourselves to You. Keep us until the day of Your coming."</article>

	<article author="Leira R. A. F." email="leiraruth@gmail.com" city="" provst="" country="Philippines" month="12" day="7" year="2013">Even though the Lord has already bought us with the most precious blood, making us His possession, still He does not force us to give ourselves to Him. He still seeks for our consecration that allows Him to work Himself in us and set His throne in our hearts. I always like hymns like these, those that express such consecration to the Lord. While we sing, we also give ourselves to Him at the same time. Praise the Lord for the utterance in this hymn! It's His mercy and His love that we give ourselves to Him!</article>
	<article author="Salem" email="salem.macnee@gmail.com" city="" provst="" country="New Zealand" month="10" day="11" year="2013">When I first heard the song, the Lord touched my heart. The words are so meaningful and full of eloquence. 

To You, dear Lord
I give myself afresh again
Unsparinginly for Your desire,
Your economy

Set your throne in my heart
From now on to the very end
It takes eternity, to know its worth
To You, to me</article>

	<article author="Maxim" email="" city="Federal Way" provst="WA" country="United States" month="6" day="9" year="2012">There are less and less people who consecrate themselves absolutely... Cause consecration sometimes is like a shout that might not have an echo... God will not answer when you want.</article>

	<article author="Ashlynne Macnee" email="" city="Arlington" provst="Texas" country="United States" month="5" day="3" year="2010">I love this song! I like the music itself, and it can be sung in rounds!
I really enjoyed that we need to give ourself afresh to the Lord unsparingly for His economy and desire!</article>
	<article author="Teresa Lam" email="" city="Lower Hutt" provst="" country="New Zealand" month="4" day="26" year="2010">This song is so touching for me. I've always loved this song, even if it was just the music at first. But now, having the realisation that this song is about absolute consecration to the Lord, it tells me that it's by the Lord's love that we would be so constrained to love Him back, to consecrate our entire lives to Him. After all, His love is the motive for our consecration. 

I also enjoyed that this consecration to the Lord, it's a matter that needs to be continuous, and not "once-for-all". The first stanza reads: "To You, dear Lord I give myself AFRESH again..." Day by day, we need to freshly give ourselves to the Lord, unsparingly for His desire. O may we experience His love in such a sweet way, to absolutely consecrate ourselves to Him, for His economy so glorious :)</article>

	<article author="Joey" email="" city="London" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="1" day="1" year="2009">"Dear divine Flame, come! Come and judge! Come and purify! Come and refine that You may gain what You are after (the golden lampstand)."

I particularly touch that "it is by your MERCY and LOVE" that I can give myself to You because the Lord in like manner "sold EVERYTHING" to purchase us.

It will take eternity to know its worth... Lord, may You gain what You after.</article>

	<article author="Bro. Fegene" email="" city="San Juan" provst="M.M." country="Philippines" month="5" day="16" year="2005">This is my consecration song for the Lord. Everytime I sing this hymn, the more I feel I am refreshed, the more I feel how I need to drop everything for Him and just love Him. How His love constrains me to give my whole being to Him and causing me to reconsecrate for Him.</article>
	<article author="Rachel P. Yabo" email="" city="Dresden" provst="" country="Germany" month="3" day="6" year="2005">Sometimes the world seems to be so attractive, drawing us away from the Lord and distracting us from the track of God's desire, His eternal economy. Truly, it is by the Lord's mercy and love that we can give ourselves fully to Him and let Him make His home in our hearts and let Him have His throne in our being. May this song be also my moment by moment prayer. Amen!</article>
