	<article author="Deladem" email="jullietens@yahoo.com" city="Accra" provst="" country="Ghana" month="9" day="1" year="2016">I was given this by my choir master as the song for Sunday. Earlier on, I had a little problem to the extent of shedding tears and asking if Jesus is aware of what am going through. I came to search for the hymn and reading through the words, I wept more and told Jesus am sorry. I know He lives and He is aware of all. Thank You Jesus for going through with me along life's stormy way.</article>

My greatest desire is to make it a heart song. Just like the birds in the tree he opens his mouth and the song burst forth. Is it so wonderful to be able to come to the living God while the dew is still on the rose. I know that I will pay dearly for this word.</article>

As I prayed for calm and peace, the words, "He walks with me, He talks with me along life's narrow way " came into my head. I was reminded of His everlasting presence and His blessed assurance thus allowing me to calm my anxiety. I am grateful to God that I am able to have this surgery to improve my vision. I am also grateful for this site because I couldn't remember the rest of the lyrics. Thank you. I'm sure this song will be playing in my head tomorrow morning.</article>

	<article author="Colleen Hossler" email="colleenann00@hotmail.com" city="Madison" provst="IN" country="" month="4" day="22" year="2014">I came across your website while searching for the story behind this hymn for the church bulletin board. At a Lenten community service recently the minister told us the story and recited the lyrics. The way he spoke was so inspiring that the congregation broke out in applause. That hadn't happened at any other Lenten service and I don't recall that ever happening at a regular church service in my experience where the people spontaneously broke into applause at the conclusion. Maybe a few 'Amens'... Anyway, I love the music available on your site and will be back.</article>

My mother was in the church choir and they all had their white robes. The church rang out with the hymn and made you believe that Christ was present right there.
Since He lives, we know He is coming back and the way things are going in the world, it seems to be approaching. Make sure you are ready for the price of not being ready is tragic. Hallelujah!!!</article>

	<article author="Rod H" email="engineer2004@yahoo.com" city="Rapid City" provst="South Dakota" country="United States" month="4" day="9" year="2014">This great hymn also has had a big impact in my life. The words alone when recited testify of our faith in a RISEN Saviour. I am reminded that only the Christian believer can make the claim that OUR Lord rose from the dead...I know of no other faith that can make this claim. I am also reminded that all of the Apostles (except John) were martyred not only because of their faith in Christ but also because of their testimony of their RISEN Saviour. How could they deny the fact that they experienced Jesus' ALIVE in physical presence after they witnessed first hand the crucifixion, death, and resurrection of our Lord. And then to read Jesus' words to Thomas saying "Because you have seen me you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed". I share with Paul where he says, " I pray also that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may KNOW the hope to which he has called you, the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints, and His incomparably great power for us who believe. Happy Easter!</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="2" day="26" year="2014">This hymn was inspired by a Jewish student who after an evangelistic meeting challenged the author by saying, "Why should I worship a dead Jew?"
Ackley responded; "He lives! I tell you, He is not dead, but lives here and now! Jesus Christ is more alive today than ever before. I can prove it by my own experience, as well as the testimony of countless 1000's." 
Mr. Ackley's forthright, emphatic answer, together with his subsequent triumphant effort to win the man for Christ, flowered forth into song and crystallized into a convincing sermon on "He Lives!" ... The scriptural evidence, his own heart, and the testimony of history matched the glorious experience of an innumerable cloud of witnesses that "He lives," so he sat down at the piano and voiced the conclusion in song. - Forty Gospel Hymn Stories by George W.

	<article author="Mike Gantt" email="mdgantt@gmail.com" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="12" day="11" year="2013">Joseph in Landover,

In the Old Testament, the false Gods were mute. "He lives within my heart" means "I hear His voice of cheer" and "He...talks with me."</article>
	<article author="Joseph" email="webmaster@jamsource.net" city="Landover" provst="MD" country="United States" month="12" day="3" year="2013">Renae (Corvallis, United States),
"Hi, I love this song.... BUT.... What does "He lives within my heart" mean? To me this song seems unfortunately to be not talking about true life, which frustrates me. I sing the whole song minus that phrase...... Anyone console me?"

Actually the song He Lives is talking about true life. Some religions bow and pray to gods of stone, animals, and nature. All of which is apart of creation. Those who serve the gods try to kill destroy the only true God but His plan was to die not only for us but for them as well and those who didn't know Him. Even though they sought out to destroy Him, physically He rose... and it's just like God when all hope is gone He shows up! Now His plan was to put that same Spirit into anyone who accepts Him freely. The same Savior in the flesh gives us His Holy Spirit that like Him we will rise, yes from the grave but rise during the time we live. Whatever crisis may come we will be able to over come all things, however; none of this is possible unless you accept Him as Your risen Savior. In the King James version Bible Philippians 1:21 it reads: For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.

In order to really live for Christ and for Him to live in you all those old things that stopped you from serving Him must cease. Meaning YOU must change...you change will trigger in others. You might not see it yourself but all you have to do is live right.

If you want to know if you are saved ... see Roman chapter 10 verse 8 through 13.</article>

	<article author="Kapet" email="leeka73@yahoo.com" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="11" day="14" year="2013">I wake up every morning with a song in my heart and different songs throughout the day. This song has special meaning to me. Several years ago I had a dream where I was walking through the halls of the school where I worked. There were students here and there who were singing this song. A student peeked out of a classroom singing this and in a crowed gym two or three students and a teacher stood out from all the others as they sang this song. Then I was fast walking through town down the middle of the road towards oncoming traffic singing this song. In the ocoming cars people were waving and happy with the song I was singing. Then I became bolder in my singing and going down the road. I was skipping and my arms were moving. I had purpose and was bold in singing the song. The oncoming people were no longer happy with the song I was singing. They were angry, gripping their steering wheels and shaking their fists at me. I then woke up and was so encouraged! This song makes me smile.</article>
	<article author="Roy C." email="rcgaard6@comcast.net" city="Bargersville" provst="IN" country="United States" month="11" day="13" year="2013">To Renae Sept 20: This seems a bit belated, but if you are still inquiring as to what "He lives within my heart" means, please dig into Scripture and find the basis for this phrase. Some examples are: John 14:15-20 "If you love me, you will obey what I command. 16 And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Counselor to be with you forever-- 17 the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you. 18 I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you. 19 Before long, the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live. 20 On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you." or Romans 8:9-11 "You, however, are controlled not by the sinful nature but by the Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ. 10 But if Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin, yet your spirit is alive because of righteousness. 11 And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit, who lives in you." or Galatians 2:20 "I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me." and 1 John 3:24 "Those who obey his commands live in him, and he in them. And this is how we know that he lives in us: We know it by the Spirit he gave us." or 1 Jn 4:15 "If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in him and he in God."
  When we accept His offer of forgiveness of sins and redemption by His blood shed for us, we receive the promised Holy Spirit who takes up residence in our hearts - His spirit living in us gives us the ability to "live by the Spirit" Galatians 5:16. Do a search for "Spirit" or "lives" on "BibleStudyTools.com" or other good biblical site, in the Book of John or other New Testament writers and you will see the extraordinary gift we have been given as Christians! I pray that helps!</article>

Today's lesson is on the Kinsman Redeemer (Ruth 4) and the song, He Lives!, plays an integral part in the lesson showing Jesus Christ, as the Kinsman Redeemer. Since God has always shown Himself to His people, the song was most appropriate.</article>

I sing old hymns and pray. I wanted to learn all the words to this song so I could sing it too. Very soothing to sing these when facing challenges of the workday! I used to just go for the contemporary Christian songs, but there's something about the old hymns that warms my soul deep inside me.</article>
	<article author="Zwei Wai" email="" city="Hamburg" provst="" country="Germany" month="2" day="15" year="2011">I was a such wretch, and laughed at God, where are You? Actually after some years, I turned to Christ, I still didn't like this kind of old hymns. I thought that these are old-fashioned. And my life wasn't in order. Because what I lived was very modern. I thought I am a Christian, but Christ didn't live in my heart. And God changed me later, I found myself the greatest liar! I called Christ, Lord, but the real Lord was sin for me. Sorry Lord, today You made me born again, and I can see You live within my heart! Thank YOU my Lord!</article>

	<article author="Sarah Dinius" email="" city="NISKAYUNA" provst="NY" country="United States" month="12" day="28" year="2009">When I was under 7 years old I lived with my grandparents in Tucson, Arizona. I remember sitting in the back seat coming back home from church listening to them sing their favorite hymn...singing in harmony the last line of the chorus "He lives within my heart". A beautiful memory, a beautiful answer to the question of how we know Christ lives. The Word became flesh, and the Word becomes flesh through us living out each day when He lives in us.</article>

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="31" year="2008">Throughout the centuries, all the living servants of God have had this resurrected Christ living in them. I can also testify that He lives in me, enabling me to do what I never could do in myself. Hallelujah, the Lord Jesus lives! How do we know He lives? As the hymn says, we know He lives because He lives in us (Hymns, #503). We may be persecuted and opposed, and we may suffer very much. But we have the resurrected Christ in us. The more we are opposed, the more alive and active we become. Nevertheless, our testimony is this: Not I, but the grace of God with us.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="27" year="2008">Many Bible readers do not have this understanding of the word witness; even our understanding is not this deep. In Galatians 2:20 Paul said, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me." This is the meaning of being a witness. A witness is a person who has Christ living in him. The chorus of a hymn says, "He lives, He lives, Christ Jesus lives today! /...You ask me how I know He lives? / He lives within my heart" (Hymns, #503). His living in us proves that He has resurrected and that He is living.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="25" year="2008">This is a good hymn, and I appreciate it. The chorus says that we know Christ lives because He walks with us and talks with us. However, this is not as good as saying that we know Christ lives because He lives within our heart. In answer to the question, "How do you know Christ lives?" the chorus of this hymn answers, "He lives within my heart!" We know that the Lord lives not simply because He walks with us and talks with us, but because He lives in us.

How do you know Christ lives? You should answer this question by saying, "I know He lives because He lives in me." Likewise, if we are asked if we have seen the Lord Jesus, we should say, "Yes, I have seen the Lord, for He lives in me. Even while you are asking me this question, He lives in me. Because He lives in me, I see Him. Even now as I am speaking, I can see Him. While I am speaking to you, He is speaking to me. I am simply a transmitter speaking whatever He speaks to me."

The Lord's word, "Because I live, you shall live also," certainly was fully fulfilled on the day of Pentecost. When Peter stood up with the eleven, that was Christ in resurrection. Peter's speaking was also Christ in resurrection. If someone had asked Peter where Christ is, he might have said, "Christ is here. Don't you see me? If you see me, you see Christ because He lives in me."
