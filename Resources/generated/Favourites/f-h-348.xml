	<article author="Thomas" email="thomas@filla.no" city="Brumunddal" provst="" country="Norway" month="8" day="26" year="2016">This is one of very few songs translated to Norwegian, where I find the translation actually better than the original. That may be because it has been revised, as contrary to the original... Translated back (not according to rythm and ryme);
When Jesus freed my soul,
Light broke through om my life path.
And when I saw him for myself
I forgot all lifes sorrows and grieves.
Hallelujah, my soul is free
My slavery has passed away.
Om land or sea, I know for sure
Where Jesus is, I find heaven
Gods Heaven seemed so far away
Untill Jesus revealed himself
He brought Heaven so close
That I can find it within my heart
Then what does it matter, If I on earth
Live in a hut or å castle
Whether the day is cloudy or clear
Where I find Christ, also Heaven is
O peace within, tranquility
God himself will dwell in me
Living is Christ to me
And death itself a win to me</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="2" day="23" year="2014">The original song has Heaven instead of joy:
---------------
1. Since Christ my soul from sin set free,
This world has been a Heav'n to me;
And 'mid earth's sorrows and its woe,
'Tis Heav'n my Jesus here to know.
--------------------
chorus:
O hallelujah, yes, ’tis Heav’n,
’Tis Heav’n to know my sins forgiv’n,
 On land or sea, what matters where?
 Where Jesus is, ’tis Heaven there.
------------------
2. Once Heaven seemed a far off place,
 Till Jesus showed His smiling face;
 Now it’s begun within my soul,
’Twill last while endless ages roll.
-----------------
3. What matters where on earth we dwell?
 On mountain top, or in the dell,
 In cottage, or a mansion fair,
 Where Jesus is, ’tis Heaven there.
--------------------------------
Christians do not go to heaven when we die or permanently. The New Jerusalem comes down from heaven from earth. However the use of "Heaven" in the original of this song is not incorrect. We are today in the kingdom of heaven (Matt 5:3). We bear the image of the heavenly (1 Cor 15:48-49), we are now living in heaven (Eph 2:6; Phil 3:20), we seek and mind the things of heaven (Col 3:1-3), and we partake of a heavenly calling (Heb 3:1). Heaven is mentioned 277 times in the New Testament.</article>

"Tis joy my Jesus here to know"
The Lord's presence is our joy and His smiling face is our reward! As we live in His presence, we will know Him.
The apostle Paul in his conversion asked the Lord, "Who are you Lord?" And the Lord replied, "It is Jesus!" (Acts 9:5). Paul spent the rest of his life seeking to know the Lord Jesus until at the end of his life he testified, "For I know whom I have believed" (2 Tim1:12). May this be our testimony! Lord we give our lives to know You and live before Your beautiful, shining face! 
"And I will give them a heart to know Me, that I am Jehovah; and they will be My people, and I will be their God; for they will return to Me with their whole heart" Jeremiah 24:7</article>

I do love this song. I am in Korea. When searching CCM, I use NAVER.com but sometimes I use GOOGLE.com, and I see this post. ^^

Jesus has changed my life. I'm not good at writing English but I wanna see peoples who love Jesus, and share His life.

Let's do work for His kingdom. Hallelujah for Jesus Christ. Thanks.</article>
