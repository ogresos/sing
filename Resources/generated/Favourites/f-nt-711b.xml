Thru this hymn I could set my way to learn these experiences. It's so precious. Till this time of my life (35) I mostly did things with thorough planning and analyzing as Paul "counted all things as loss" (Phil. 3:7-8). He has counted (compared, calculated), he was sober in those things, leaving, repudiating religious and all other things as nothing, dogs' food. 
But here goes the other dimension of knowing Christ, where I go in the light, that light being God Himself. Especially those lines struck me:
 I go not knowing;
 I would not if I might;
Iâ€™d rather walk in the dark with God
 Than go alone in the light;
As an engineer I need to learn things first, I need to know things related to the matter, yet now it comes "I would not [know] if I might" - seems no need to spend precious time for getting knowledge if I'm in Him, abiding in this sweet union of lifes; "and every hour in perfect peace". Lord, keep me experiencing You in this way, trusting You to the uttermost, getting rid of my anxious thoughts. Heading not to the knowledge but to You.</article>
