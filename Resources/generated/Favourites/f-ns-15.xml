Yes, I was crucified with the Christ. So no longer I who live in the flesh but the Christ in me! Amen!!
As Jesus Christ was crucified and died on the cross, He abolished in His flesh the the law of the commandments in ordinances. Amen, Hallelujah ~ ~ ~ That He might create the two in Himself into one new man, so making peace, Hallelujah ~ ~ ~

I don't wanna take hold of any sorts of law in ordinances against brothers and sisters in the Body. Rather I'll apply this fact shined into me to myself in the Church life. Hallelujah ~ ~ ~ Praise the Lord!

You're Victor! Victor on the Cross, and eternal Redeemer and Savior. Hallelujah ~</article>
    <article author="Patricia" city="Fullerton" provst="CA" country="United States" month="10" day="3" year="2009">I have the same feeling about "when I try to take control of my life, this song reminds me that I'm crucified with Christ and I'm no longer the one who lives but it is Christ who liveth in me and that He is in control." When I faced some situation, it is good experience to exercise my spirit and let me turn to the LORD JESUS. I need to crucify with Christ, no longer I, but Christ. ^^</article>
    <article author="bro doy" city="Philippines" provst="" country="Philippines" month="7" day="26" year="2009">I was enlightened by this verse on the matter of "...it is no longer I who lives but Christ lives in me". Much more when I heard this song, I always sing it.

Lately as I was enjoying reading again the verse (with the footnotes), I noticed the second half of the verse "...the faith OF the Son of God" I came to realize that this faith is OF CHRIST, as the footnote on Gal. 2:16 #1 "...This Christ becomes in them the faith by which they believe and the capacity to believe through their appreciation of Him."

Hallelujah! We have the life and the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ in us!</article>
    <article author="Jane Otse" city="Lagos" provst="Lagos" country="Nigeria" month="7" day="13" year="2008">I love this song a lot, I enjoyed the song with the saints from the USA during a conference in Nigeria. It was wonderful. The tune here is quite different though. LORD JESUS I LOVE YOU, I AM CRUCIFIED WITH CHRIST AND IT IS NO LONGER I WHO LIVE.</article>

    <article author="Gary Lu" city="Auckland" provst="" country="New Zealand" month="11" day="9" year="2002">Every time when I try to take control of my life, this song reminds me that I'm crucified with Christ and I'm no longer the one who lives but it is Christ who liveth in me and that He is in control. So Amen saints, it is Christ who is in control!</article>
