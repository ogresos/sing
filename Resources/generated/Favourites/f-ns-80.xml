	<article author="Jo" email="" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="7" day="24" year="2008">Somebody sent me this song when I was struggling in a very difficult situation. But whatever our situation is, don't believe the lie from the enemy that Christ isn't real. On the contrary, He is SOOOO enjoyable, and His life is SOOOO applicable!!! I just want to say, PRAISE THE LORD!</article>
