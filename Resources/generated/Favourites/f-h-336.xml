I will keep this hymn adoring Jesus in my soul all the day long! No matter what we face how wonderful to worship our Lord and sing praises enduring for ever more.</article>

He has been making me understand that yes, in fact, He does. This lovely song is a reminder of that truth, Jesus loves us all. It also teaches us to trust him, we don't have to know where when why or how, we just need to trust Him and follow our good Shepherd. He's in control.  Blessings!</article>
