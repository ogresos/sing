Sometimes we may think that the Lord, being our faithful Shepherd, should fix a certain situation for us, or bring us out of a certain circumstance, and yet He doesn't. Perhaps this is because He wants us to know that He is enough for us, even for going through that situation and for remaining in that circumstance. If He fixed the situation, we would only have one positive and somewhat shallow experience of Him, but if He continually supplied us with Himself while we endure through that situation, we would learn how to continually come to Him and fellowship with Him, and perhaps even to abide in Him.

If we are quick to complain when He doesn't fix our problems, then there could never be much depth in our dependence on Him.

Thank You Lord for everything!</article>

	<article author="Henry Francis B. Espiritu" email="" city="Cebu City" provst="Cebu" country="Philippines" month="9" day="2" year="2011">Oh my Beloved Lord! Thou art to me as my enablement! Thou art the All-Sufficient One and I am nothing! Oh to be nothing so I may gain Thee as my everything! Oh Lord, oh my Beloved, Thou art my All-in-All and without Thee I am just a dust--an insignificant speck in this ephemeral universe. With Thee, I am complete! Without thee I am barren, forlorn and desolate. Oh Thou Almighty One, Thou art my Guide and Stay and I am continually a pain to my own self without Thy abiding presence! Do not withhold Thy Presence away from me. Oh Beloved Lord, at Thy Banqueting Table, Thou hast filled me with all the good things and Thou hast feed me with Thy own choicest gift--Thy very own Life Itself! Oh my All-Sufficient One! Oh my Beloved Lord, what can I ask but to surrender at Thy resplendent feet and become Thy insignificant slave! Better a day at Thy footstool than listening to the noises of my self-life! Amen!</article>

By resurrection He has silenced all our death. Now we enjoy the calm of His own rest.</article>
	<article author="Isaiah Tor" email="" city="Sydney" provst="NSW" country="Australia" month="7" day="27" year="2009">The sweetness of this hymn lies not merely in the provision of the Lord for all our needs, but also that in so enjoying His provision and all-inclusive care we "sink", dwell deeply in the riches of His Person, His name. As we dwell in this All-sufficient One, He creates for us "whate'er" we lack, denoting to us that He is the God who call things not being as being. Such a provision is in our apprehension of Him as the God of resurrection, the One who is within us supplying all that we need both inwardly and outwardly. It is in such a sweet, available and intimate One, that we "fling", not only our cares, but ourselves upon His "breast", and there adore His ways in faith's deep rest!</article>
