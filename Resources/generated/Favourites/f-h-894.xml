An overcomer exercises to be in his/her spirit all the time, today more than yesterday and to be in the meetings of the church. O Lord Jesus, gain Your overcomers from among us. Lord Jesus, we don't know how but we can exercise to be in our spirit today more than yesterday, to be in the meetings of the church. Amen, O Lord Jesus!</article>

This song's chorus has different meanings in different languages. In Chinese and Japanese the chorus is:
"Will You be an overcomer, satisfy Lord's want?
Lord is calling, Lord is calling, for You to get the crown."

In Spanish it is:
"Are You among the overcomers, follow in pursuit?
Christ's calling, Christ's calling, listen to His voice!"

I want to be an overcomer because...
1. I want to make a smart choice.
2. I want to get the crown.
3. I love to follow Him.
4. I love to listen to His voice.
5. Most importantly, because I love Him and wants to satisfy His wants by accomplishing His economy.</article>
