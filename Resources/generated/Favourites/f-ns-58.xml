    <article author="P Watson" city="Lake Forest" provst="CA" country="United States" month="5" day="11" year="2011">This song can be sung with the Bible references from which it came. It's the best way to remember the verses concerning the origin, content, and function of the Bible. 

Verse 1 (sung after the pause): 2 Tim. 3:16; 2 Pet. 1:21; Heb. 1:1-2; John 16:13
Verse 2 (after the pause): John 5:39; 2 Tim. 3:15; 1 Pet. 1:23
v2 lines 4-5 (sing only the references): 1 Pet. 2:2; Matt. 4:4; 2 Tim. 3:17</article>
    <article author="Tammy L. Mills" city="Plainfield" provst="New Hampshire" country="U.S.A." month="4" day="3" year="2008">I really like the song because it's so catchy, and I think that my fellow church members and I should sing it as often as we can when we have Sunday worship services at 10:00 at my local church.  This way, we can blend the new songs with the older ones, and we won't be bored with the same classic hymns all the time.</article>
