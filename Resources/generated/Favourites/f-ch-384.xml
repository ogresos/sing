SUBJECT: EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST-AS FOOD
METER: 8.8.8.6. with chorus.
AUTHOR: Witness Lee
COMPOSER: Charles H. Gabriel

1	A flowing river and a tree,
 	Eden’s outstanding features are,
 	Man to supply with food and drink
 	 	That he may live fore’er.
Chorus 
 	 	God is in Christ to be my supply,
 	 	God as the Spirit nourisheth me;
 	 	If upon Christ in spirit I feed,
 	 	 	Filled with His life I’ll be.
2	The tree the glorious Christ does show
 	As living food to man supplied,
 	That he God’s riches may enjoy,
 	 	Thus to be satisfied.
3	The river does the Spirit show,
 	Coming man’s spirit to supply,
 	That with God’s riches he be filled,
 	 	Holy to be thereby.
4	The Christ of glory is my life,
 	He as the Spirit lives in mine,
 	That I with God be fully blent
 	 	And in His image shine.
5	I would exalt this glorious Christ,
 	Ever the Spirit I’d obey,
 	Making His glory fully known,
 	 	Filled with His grace for aye.</article>
