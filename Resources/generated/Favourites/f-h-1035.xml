Born at Marpool Hall, in Exmouth, England, she wrote many hymns and poems which were published in 6 collections. She is considered to be one of the chief women among the Brethren. - Songs of the Spirit by Martin
-----------------
The song arrangement here is the most common one. There are some additional stanzas:
2 His anguish of soul on the cross hast thou seen? 
His cry of distress hast thou heard? 
Then why, if the terrors of wrath He endured, 
 Should pardon to thee be deferred? 
 ---------------
3 We are healed by His stripes. Wouldst thou add to the word? 
 And He is our righteousness made; 
 The best robe of heaven He bids thee put on: 
 Oh! couldst thou be better arrayed? 
----------------------------
an additional final stanza:
6 There is life in a look at the crucified One: 
 There is life at this moment for thee: 
 Then look, sinnerâ€”look unto Him and be saved, 
 And know thyself spotless as He.</article>
