I remember this song sung beautifully by Sonny Liu.</article>
	<article author="Eric" email="" city="Oklahoma City" provst="Oklahoma" country="United States" month="6" day="22" year="2015">This song presents the dichotomy of the choice all of us have everyday... The world or Christ! This song gently reminds me that there is only one choice... Only one cure for the emptiness in our storm-tossed souls... Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ!!</article>

	<article author="Nathan" email="father12@centurytel.net" city="Marlette" provst="MIchigan" country="United States" month="5" day="22" year="2015">From the first time I sang this song at a funeral in the Philipines in 1975, this song has helped me to stay focused on what is really important in life. The Lord's path is the only one that brings true purpose to our existence here on earth. I wish that all would heed the message of this song.</article>

	<article author="Emmanuel Babaniji" email="emmanuelbabaniji@yahoo.com" city="London" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="1" day="31" year="2014">It is a song that steers the heart to a deeper, wider and higher consecration and commitment before the LORD JESUS: after all if you don't have JESUS, I really don't know what you have got that can truly and completely settle your heart's yearning for real joy and eternal peace in a world vexed in transient transition and certain uncertainties like our ever changing weather.</article>

And by His grace align myself more to the Saviour's cross, my heart is tuned more to the narrow way that the Lord has paved to take to Eternal Bliss. 
It has been a great delight to sing this song to my soul over and over, and to minister with it to the Lord's People over the years.</article>
	<article author="Karen W" email="" city="Kelowna" provst="British Columbia" country="Canada" month="11" day="8" year="2012">I have always loved to sing this song and thought I did so from my heart. Until I was taken to a place where I lost everything. How I struggled 'against the pricks' and tried to protect myself against loss. But finally my Dear Jesus was able to bring me to the place of surrender where I was able to say: 'Though He slay me, yet will I trust Him. Yes to Jesus for whatever He desires.' Now my heart can truly sing the words: 'Oh the joy of having all in Jesus, Nothing else in all the world beside.' What a joy to learn to trust that Love.</article>
	<article author="Jean Patience" email="" city="Likasi" provst="Katanga" country="Democratic Republic Of Congo" month="12" day="24" year="2011">Thank You for Your love my Lord Jesus. I need Your help not to forget these words anymore :"Never a sin so great, but He'll forgive it,
Nor a sorrow that He does not feel!
If I have but Jesus, only Jesus,
Nothing else in all the world besideâ€”
O then everything is mine in Jesus;
For my needs and more He will provide." So may I live a life of a winner.</article>

	<article author="M" email="" city="" provst="Ontario" country="Canada" month="3" day="5" year="2011">I'm so thankful to my Lord for such a wonderful reality. Had I not met the Lord when I did, I don't know where I'd be. By His mercy He is keeping me from a life of emptiness, seeking success and a revered name. Praise Him! NONE OF THESE THINGS ARE WORTH COMPARING WITH A MERE MOMENT WITH A CHRIST-FILLED LIFE! Thank You Lord Jesus for Your great mercy! A worthless sinner but chosen and loved by You, thank You Lord! If I have but Jesus, only Jesus! Praise our glorious Lord!</article>
	<article author="Paula Donaldson Inglis" email="" city="" provst="Fife" country="United Kingdom" month="4" day="4" year="2010">What a joy to find this old hymn on the net after not hearing it for years! I can't read it without feeling moved! What a challenge and an inspiration! Anna Olander certainly lived near to Christ before she was able to write these wonderful words! May we all be inspired to have depth and substance in our hymns that we choose to sing and our lives! In the words of another hymn, "Only one life, t'will soon be passed, only what's done for Christ will last! Wishing all readers God's blessings!</article>

Oh my Lord Jesus, nothing else in all the world like You. Such Jesus i have as my everything for my need and more He will surely provide.</article>
