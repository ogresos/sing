	<article author="Steven Miller" email="smille10@sbcglobal.net" city="Detroit" provst="Michigan" country="United States" month="5" day="27" year="2016">Dr. Smith tells us of some of his struggles and heart searchings for God's Holy Spirit and purity of heart in his book, "The Revival We Need". Every minister who yearns to be a winner of souls will be helped by this book. Quoted from the book:
"Gathered 3 into my study this evening. Found much sympathy and willingness to co-operate, but almost entire ignorance as to the Holy Spirit. Came home rejoicing, for I firmly believe God will move upon the hearts of the people in answer to prevailing prayer...
Have been reading the diary of David Brainard. Months and months of agonizing prayer, and then the mighty power of God upon the Indians. I mush have Holy Spirit Fruit, nothing else ....
Jan 11th. This afternoon I went to my study and tried to pray. It was impossible. So hard was I opposed that I finally threw myself down and ceased to struggle, but after a while I rose, determined to win. Then victory came. The powers of darkness seemed to leave, and I was able to pray for over an hour."
At last the break came. One soul after another came to the altar and wept his or her way through to forgiveness and pardon. He tells of many being saved and the weeping and joy in His Presence, as souls were born into His kingdom.
People began to pour into their meetings and the Holy Spirit struck them with conviction. Souls cried and prayed for deliverance, and many came through, washed in the blood of the Lamb. Crowds gathered and packed the church. It was the Lord. 
Dr. Smith was saved as a young lad. He yearned to go to the mission field, but each time his health broke down. Later he became pastor of the People's Church, Toronto. The church was in debt. The young pastor announced that they would give the first 2 months offerings to Missions. Some thought he would bankrupt the church, but one cannot bankrupt God. The Lord Himself blessed them, and today People's Church helps to support over 400 missionaries in fields around the world. The church under the leadership (under God) of Dr. Smith's son, Dr. Paul Smith (1959-94) continued to prosper.
Missionary work was divinely instituted by our Savior, Himself. He gave the Divine Commission, and truly, He honors those who honor Him. He never fails. It is only when people become fearful, and feel they cannot afford to give to Missions and put God first, that the church fails. - Wilbur Konkel "Hymn Stories"</article>

The Savior solves every problem. There is nothing that He cannot do. He satisfies wholly. He fills our empty heart. We were made for His filling.</article>

Also a double portion with my "daily bread": Matt 11:28 "Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest. (29) Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.(30) For My yoke is easy and My burden is light." Praise the Lord!</article>
