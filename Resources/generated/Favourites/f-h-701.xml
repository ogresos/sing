Was taken by the beauty of these words which addressed my situation so well. Instead of giving in to murmuring because of my pain, I should say along with Mrs. Crosby..."For I know, whate’er befall me, Jesus doeth all things well,"
Yes, I know that Jesus is only allowing that which is needful for my completeness in Christ.</article>

	<article author="IrisCrystal Seok" email="tgnrsvt@yahoo.com" city="" provst="" country="South Korea" month="8" day="28" year="2014">Thanks for your further sharing, Sara. Yes, we need to proceed to the maturity in the Lord in the matter of our attaining to having the heart of the father (1Co.4:15) toward others and to the degree of our handling things as “the faithful and prudent steward” (Lk.12:42) for the Body, which can be accomplished only in proportion to what we actually are before the Lord based on our directly being dealt by the Lord in mutual fellowship and transaction with Him, not in proportion to what we hope or wish based on our second-hand hearing the message or own research on the Bible just in mental realm. 
  And in sharing with others our own experiences or some certain matters with relation to the work and ministry for the Body, most importantly I would like to be reminded of that very practical advice from our beloved forerunner brother, which is such a helpful compass for our progress in the Lord: right, ministering to the Lord Himself in Life(Ezk.44:15) as “a noble deed”(Mk.14:6) and “a better part”(Lk.10:42) is different from and cannot be compared with ministering to “the house” by “plowing or tendering sheep in the field”(Lk.17:7). And just in the same context of another brother’s touching confession in the last paragraph of his message of ‘Life-Study of Ruth’, I also would like to be privileged with taking the “better part” and be led by the Lord Himself only in Life, through “looking away unto Jesus”(Heb.12:2), ‘looking undivided attention by turning away from every other object’, until this endowed being in this earthly life may be one with and be constituted by the “words of eternal life”(Jn.6:68) which may be “difficult”(Jn.6:60) for us to assimilate and be one with.
  Lord, may You be enthroned in each one’s heart more and more as the most precious One “until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ”(Eph.4:13). Praise the Lord!</article>
	<article author="Sarah Munyi" email="sarahmunyi@in.com" city="Nairobi" provst="" country="Kenya" month="8" day="22" year="2014">Amen thank you Seok. I like the way Jesus ministered when He was on earth. Sometimes He would speak a message that many people would not understand and people would wonder amongst themselves on what He meant when He said something. Even the parables that He spoke were hidden messages yet He would speak them in the hearing of all, men, women and children. He knows the hearts of all men and His words are the very needs of those hearts.
Others would go to Him at night (in their ignorance) to get the meaning of His words as in the case of Nicodemus. Nicodemus was so stupefied about being born again he was a Pharisee, teacher of the law, well versed in the laws of God yet he did not know how a man can be born again to enter the kingdom of God. Jesus blinded his wisdoms and Godly intellect to be able to accept the truths of the kingdom. Actually, if you read the story well the Bible does not record on the departure of Nicodemus after speaking with Jesus...... after this Jesus and His disciples went into the Judean countryside, and He remained there with them and was baptizing (John 3:22). He got born again into the kingdom and became a disciple and went with Jesus to Judea ......He makes wise men retreat and turns their knowledge into foolishness (Isaiah 44:25). God draws people to the truth in these ways. Sometimes they refute the word when we speak but this does not change the position of God on a matter even if it takes time yet ……every knee shall bow to Me, and every tongue shall confess to God (Romans 14:11)
Other times His word is simple and easy to understand for all. He is a good Father. He brings on the dining table food for all children from the smallest to the biggest. Just like the way He gave Manna to the Israelites. Same food to all people and it was useful to them all. We need to attain the level of the Father this way we can minister at all levels because we know the needs of all. We can relate to the Israelites who have crossed the Jordan and into their inheritance yet we can relate with those who have just crossed the Red Sea, singing the song of Miriam. I want the Father!</article>
	<article author="IrisCrystal Seok" email="tgnrsvt@yahoo.com" city="" provst="" country="South Korea" month="8" day="15" year="2014">Thanks for your sharing, Sara. 
Actually a few months ago, for some reason with relation to comment posting process I came to decide that from that time on at this Hymnal site I’d better not participate in comment-posting fellowship anymore but, just right now when I came across and found your comment, your remark brought me to have a second thought about my previous decision.
First, I’d like to say that in dealing with things or handling church affairs, the attitude and practice of “for some specific persons let there be something for their own need at their stage and level” should be applied in practicality only under the condition of accompanying the prerequisite of ministering Christ to others for building up the Body of Christ in view, otherwise those approach seems to be able to bring in an inclination to being “wealthy and rich” (Rev. 3:17) in self-complacence and indifference toward others; in other words, I think we should be reminded that the reason we’d better not utter something to some others in certain cases, rather just try to “have it to ourselves before God” (Rom. 14:22) in silence, can be accepted only in the situation that we consider before the Lord those ones’ spiritual condition and capacity to receive and assimilate some matters in Light and Life and for their benefit.
And second, as far as the household of God consists of people on diverse progressive stages in Life &amp; Truth, in each one’s current walking in the Lord and the present condition before the Lord, there are, of course, many different levels with one another’s situation. At the path of our pursuing the Lord in Life, for the practice that the advanced ones “who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of those who are weak and not to please own selves”(Rom.15:1), there seems to be a need of not only an advanced one’s non-manifestation of specific matters toward a certain one in fellowship just in the consideration of that very one’s condition at that moment and the more effective ministry towards that one in the future, but also progressive inspiring and challenging the other, instead of just let the situation be as what it is, through ministering for that one what the advanced ones have received from the Lord, that is, the Christ in revelation which has been built in each one’s being for sharing and building up the Body, and which can help and guide the other to take further steps in progress and fellowship.
I think that what we, as seekers of the Lord, also need and should be reminded of in the way of our going together in pursuing the Lord as one meal offering is this second part, and that’s why sometimes we need to share advanced ministry message or properly adapted lyric based on newly opened vision and revelation according to the Lord’s bestowment, aiming to share new songs and newly opened ministry message as we cannot help but endeavor to share it with and for some others, instead of mere acquiescence. If a child only can see all other ones around him drinking and eating what he drink and eat, it would be difficult for him to recognize other “solid food” and have possibility of appetite for “solid food for the full-grown” (Heb. 5:12~14).
And when we share it, I’d like to be reminded that we should make our best in “being always ready for a defense to everyone who asks” (1Pet.3:15) of us an account concerning what we share, that very newly opened messages or praises, “with meekness and fear, having a good conscience” (1 Pet. 3:16) and “in sincerity” (2 Cor. 2:17). Praise the Lord!</article>
	<article author="T. RiCardo Whylly" email="trwhylly@gmail.com" city="" provst="" country="Bahamas" month="7" day="28" year="2014">I love this song. It is strength in building my faith.
When I feel challenged and in the struggles of life, it brings comfort to my spirit and reassures me that God "doth all things well" and I must not be discouraged in well doing. Amen.</article>
	<article author="Sarah" email="sarahmunyi@in.com" city="Nairobi" provst="" country="" month="5" day="12" year="2014">This is a wonderful hymn no doubt the writer had walked deeply with God and experienced Him every moment of his life. He sounds contented and as if he has lived to the fulness of his days he is at rest and just reflecting on God's guidance and faithfulness. How wonderful, that is where this songs takes me TO REST; knowing that Jesus doeth all things well.
I do agree with sister Seok that sometimes the original version of a song may contain excepts which are not 'relevant' or they have been bypassed by the continual revelation of the Holy Spirit as we advance in God. There are things that appealed to me when I was a child but now they appeal to me no more. I outgrew them and moved on to more important and mature things. It is the same in the spirit. However, I do not think that the original version should be changed to suit the current level of revelation. It is good they stay original and with the revelation of that time. There are people they will assist and bless at that level. 
As God take us higher he shall reveal new songs with new revelations. There is a song we have sung for a long time in my local language and it says....'Oh will there be found faithful witnesses on earth to speak boldly that Jesus is Lord' ......it was a long song and it blessed us so much. But as we went on God started ministering to us that we have become just as the Word became flesh. And it was very difficult to sing this song until God revealed another song.....'Now in the world there have been found witnesses who'll speak boldy that Jesus is Lord just as the disciples did'. 
God will reveal new songs new things as we advance in Him but for children let there be milk.</article>

	<article author="Isaac Oyan" email="oyanakiny2k@yahoo.com" city="Richmond" provst="Texas" country="United States" month="2" day="8" year="2014">I love this hymn because when I first heard the hymn, it really touched my heart and made me to have a very deep thought about my life and how God has been always there for me since the beginning of my life. I have no option than to submit to His total obedience and perfect love. He is my Guide.
On the flip side, when I came across this hymn on this site, it seems some of the wordings/lyrics are not like the same l knew before, when I compared them together later I found out that the wordings have been updated to a modern day language for easy interpretation. I say thanks to you all for this job well done. It is well with you all in Jesus name.</article>
	<article author="IrisCrystal Seok" email="tgnrsvt@yahoo.com" city="" provst="" country="South Korea" month="1" day="17" year="2014">One of the many aspects which I appreciate regarding this web site is that on these web pages from time to time a well-adaptation version of the lyric based on the biblical truth and the vision of this age is found and can be enjoyed; for instance, another hymn written by F.J. Crosby, “We are never weary singing our eternal song”, I could find that the original lyric in the 3rd stanza “We are going to a palace that is built of gold”, which appeared to cause difficulty in its being acceptable in Biblical sense, had been modified as “We are going on to glory as the Lord has told”. 
  Likewise, in another hymn “My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus Christ” written by Edward Mote (1797~1874), I appreciated a part of the original lyric such as “My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus’ blood and righteousness” in the 1st stanza, which seemed to be unclear about the differentiation and clarification between ‘the righteousness of Jesus’ and ‘Christ as righteousness’ (1 Cor. 1:30, Jer. 33:16), had been substituted with “My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus Christ, my righteousness”, and also the original lyric such as “Dressed in His righteousness alone” in 4th stanza was corrected as “In Him, my righteousness, alone”.
  And in the same manner, I’d like to expect the phrase of “in Jesus” (“To be happy in Jesus”) in the hymn “Trust and obey” written by John Henry Sammis (1846-1919) also to be reconsidered because in Biblical truth, we would say that we are “in the Lord” or “in Christ Jesus” not “in Jesus”.
  Both the original lyric and the adaptation version lyric on this web site may be enjoyed; however, sometimes I feel that some of the original lyric contents lie in the limitation of that age when it was written, in other words, limitation in the matter of revelations and Biblical truth, so in that sense from time to time a part of the original lyric content is regarded as something not to be accepted in its entirety, rather for which a sensibly adapted version is needed. 
  May the Lord who is leading our praises (Heb. 2:12, Isaiah 42:8) dwell in our hearts and sit enthroned upon the praises of Israel (Eph. 3:17, Ps. 22:3)!</article>

I came across from an article that the writer of this hymn was Fanny Crosby. She was blinded at 6 weeks of age by a spurious doctor. Her grandmother Eunice was determined that she would never grow up diabled or disadvantaged. Eunice spent years training her. Helped Fanny to memorise large portion of the Bible. Through the vast storehouse, she later produced hymns. This is one of them.
The Lord has specific purpose for our lives and He does it perfectly. All glory and Honor to Him.</article>

	<article author="Andrew Lim" email="" city="Singapore" provst="Singapore" country="Singapore" month="5" day="23" year="2009">I still remember clearly that I first learned this hymn way back in January 1978.

During that time, I was going through long period of disappointments, unhappiness. 

I went to church not expecting much. Somehow, my pastor at that time, Rev Ronnie Goh, led us in this hymn and it had helped me tremendously in lifting my gloomy spirit and assuring me, comforting me that all the way my Saviour leads me.

Throughout all these years, whenever I feel sad or face with problems after problems, remembering the lyrics and singing the  hymn has never failed to bring me much comfort.</article>

I have only just stumbled across it and am trying to learn it by listening to the sound file and reading the music but the sheet music chords are more for piano than guitar, can anyone please share the guitar chords for this song? I would love to teach the highschoolers in New Zealand! Not just most the way but all the way my Savior leads me!</article>

	<article author="Mark" email="" city="Louisville" provst="KY" country="United States" month="5" day="9" year="2008">This one has a great story attached to it.  One day Fanny Crosby was praying for her most immediate need-five dollars for her publisher.  when she finished praying there was a knock on her door.  At the door was a young man who claimed to be an admirer of her work (in her life more than 8000 hymn texts--not bad for someone who was blind her whole life).  As he was leaving, they shook hands, pressing into her hand five dollars!!!</article>
