	<article author="Mrs Murray" email="mikeandtammymurray@gmail.com" city="Molalla" provst="Oregon" country="United States" month="10" day="12" year="2015">I learned this song as a child at summer camp meeting. I hum it often throughout my days. But what has blessed my soul is that my son's (all 5) whistle and hum it too. While they seem unaware that they are "copying mom" I am blessed that they have picked a prayer to the Lord to whistle through their day.</article>
	<article author="Majem" email="majemajuyah@yahoo.co.uk" city="Lagos" provst="" country="Nigeria" month="7" day="6" year="2015">The song came to my spirit man as I was reading the great deliverance in Exodus 3:1. Especially vs 7 which clearly shows that God is aware of what we are passing through and will deliver when we cry unto Him in total submission. I pray in the name of Jesus that as you sing and meditate on the power of God that deliver to the uttermost God Himself will deliver You by His Mighty Powers. In the Name of Jesus.</article>

	<article author="Vicki" email="" city="Cleveland" provst="Ohio" country="United States" month="11" day="6" year="2012">I'm glad I found this song in hymnal. I've known this song for years. I found this song by accident in youtube and have played over and over. I am waiting for the music to play this song so I can sing with the wordings. I hope this won't be played too fast. Unto me O Lord.</article>
