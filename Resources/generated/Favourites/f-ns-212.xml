	<article author="Marie" email="mariethardy@yahoo.com" city="San Diego" provst="CA" country="United States" month="9" day="30" year="2015">Each time! Each time to You, Lord. Each morning. Each time, may we taste Your newness and freshness. Each morning, turn our hearts to You. Grant us Your presence. Then later, refresh us! Again and again, throughout each day. Come to us, draw us back to You. Remind us! Over and over, day after day. Bother us, Lord, with Your desire for us! Delight us by reminding us of Yourself, the most precious One to us. Break through every preoccupation, every distraction, by being the greater, greatest Attraction. We love You and give ourselves to You again today, Lord.</article>
