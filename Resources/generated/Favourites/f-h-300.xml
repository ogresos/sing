	<article author="Pascal" email="" city="" provst="" country="Barbados" month="7" day="14" year="2014">If you click on the lead sheet on the left, e.g. PIANO, you would see how the words match the music. At first I too was a bit confused.</article>
	<article author="Keith" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="12" day="7" year="2013">Brothers, in the hymnal there are 2 tunes to this hymn, and I've never heard it sung to the 1st one (the one linked here). I'm sure it is because the 1st tune is more difficult to follow and sing (especially because of the embellishments). The easier 2nd tune enables one to focus more on the wonderful words. Perhaps you can provide both tunes? Much grace to you.</article>

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="31" year="2008">In His vicarious death for us, Christ was wounded for our transgressions, crushed for our iniquities, and cut off out of the land of the living for our transgression, and He bore our sin, that we may have peace and be healed (Isa. 53:5, 8b, 11c, 12c). A well-known hymn by Charles Wesley (Hymns, #300, stanza 3) speaks of the wounds Christ bore for our transgressions. The Hebrew word translated wounded in Isaiah 53:5 is different from the word for pierced in Zechariah 12:10. Christ was wounded by the nails in His hands and His feet, by the spear that pierced His side, and by the crown of thorns on His head. He was wounded for our transgressions. You may feel that, because you have never killed anyone or robbed anyone, you are a good person. You may be a good person, but did you not lose your temper toward your mother at least once? Was that not a transgression? We do not count small transgressions, but God counts them. Whether we owe someone one million dollars or one dime, we are still debtors.

Charles Wesley in one of his hymns spoke of the "five bleeding wounds" which Christ received on Calvary (Hymns, #300). His two hands, His two feet, and His side (John 19:34) were pierced by the Roman soldiers who executed Him.
