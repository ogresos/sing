The early Methodists took their lives in their hands when they announced themselves as followers of John and Charles Wesley. One writer declared, "There were outrageously treated - stoned, mauled, ducked, hounded with bulldogs, threatened, homes looted, businesses ruined. Anyone who walked through a town could pick out by their ruinous condition the houses where Methodists lived." In one incident at Devizes in Feb, 1747, a crowd surrounded the house where the Methodist leaders were staying, breaking the windows and ripping off the shutters. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>
