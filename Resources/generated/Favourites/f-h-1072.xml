	<article author="Oladipo Olayemi" email="" city="Owerri" provst="Imo State" country="Nigeria" month="6" day="5" year="2012">The touch of His garment in faith brings healing, may the Lord give us the great faith as of old to touch Jesus in our prayer in spirit.</article>
	<article author="Adenike Odunuga" email="" city="Lagos" provst="" country="Nigeria (presently in Abuja)" month="1" day="21" year="2007">This song from the story of the woman with the issue of blood healed by putting her faith in Jesus has a compelling force drawing one to act likewise to receive from Jesus. I is so simple and comes out like a recipe - do likewise and you shall get the same result. Even though we may not see the physical presence of Jesus' cloth to touch, we may by faith stretch our hands to him, His Spirit is here with us. In any case the garment that she touched was a means to an end - His power of healing. That power is still here with us. Acts 1:8 says 'you shall receive power...'The power of Christ is here in the Church (the body of believers) and may be accessed by faith, by determination to be unhindered by the crowd of doubt and obstacles. Get in to the Word that became flesh and the very presence of Christ will come real to you. His actions show him forth. We will yet see him but our desire for now is for his power to work mightily in us as it did in that woman.</article>
