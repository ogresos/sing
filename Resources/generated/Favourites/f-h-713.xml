	<article author="Judy M." email="judymoore01@verizon.net" city="Baltimore" provst="MD" country="United States" month="6" day="20" year="2016">I thank each of your for testimony of our Lord's faithfulness to you in your trials. It has been the same with me over my lifetime and especially in these most recent years, even through a rare and dangerous cancer, stage 3c. Your words of hope, strength and comfort have blessed me beyond words. I was once a church organist, and I know this blessed hymn well. And I have lived it, too, along with you. Lord Jesus, please keep us close to your precious side through it all.</article>
	<article author="Kathy" email="katstuff56@gmail.com" city="Salem" provst="OR" country="United States" month="6" day="13" year="2016">I just sang this to my sweet mom who has Alzheimer's &amp; in the hospital because she started having seizures. This is a scary place for her and she's desperately missing the love of her life for 61 years because my dad had a stroke 2 weeks ago. He is in a rehab center miles from here desperately missing her. They used to sing this together in church when I was growing up. Tomorrow when I go see my dad I will sing it to him. We serve an awesome God who blessed my life with these two wonderful parents &amp; I am trusting Him for their future &amp; changes that lay ahead. 
I hope this also encourages anyone who reads this. Time &amp; time again my Lord has never forsaken me during the unknown paths of my life...and He never will.</article>
	<article author="Ken" email="klcrossman@icloud.com" city="Mesa" provst="Arizona" country="United States" month="5" day="29" year="2016">I remember a Wednesday evening in April ten years ago that I sang that song in a midweek prayer service at a church in Ohio. Two days later, my life literally feel apart when my wife left me, which had the effect of thrusting me wholly on the Lord. The song always had deep meaning to me, as many times in the past, God has been there for me. You never know that God is all you need until God is all you have. Since that night of calamity, I have gone through the dark night of the soul over and over again as God has brought me through trial after trial, a heart transplant, End Stage Kidney Disease and yet He touched me again and again with His loving and healing heart; a heart that is kind beyond all measure.</article>

My wife and I are worried for about 3 years for our oldest boy. He has been in the wrong path. We have worry, cry and blame each other, but we have heard from Christian brothers never, never stop Praying for him. We praise the Lord, His is The Glory, and He does work in ways that we don't always know.</article>

Praise God from Whom all blessings flow. @ T. Benton. And others, Do not be discouraged. Keep trusting. Christ still knocks on the door of the heart, and as long as it beats, there is hope.

	<article author="T. Benton" email="rbicoach@aol.com" city="Waco" provst="Texas" country="United States" month="3" day="10" year="2016">My daddy is a Baptist minister and we've sung this hymn as a duet together since before I was in high school and many years into my adulthood. I know it by memory. 
I'm hurting so deeply tonight for our 16 year old son who has taken the wrong path and is self-destructing before our eyes. None of our efforts, over 2 years, have helped. I feel lost and hopeless, even as a strong believer.
As I found myself at my piano tonight, flipping through the great hymns, I come to Day by Day. I play through, lifting my voice to God, each verse speaking deeply to my heart and ministering to my brokenness. 
Of all the many times I've sung, this is the first time I've truly listened to the message. The words brought so much comfort, so much peace.
I hope it finds it's way to others who's hearts are breaking and in need of a mighty, all-powerful God.</article>
	<article author="Grieving soul" email="sobsbob720@gmail.com" city="" provst="" country="" month="12" day="4" year="2015">Such an awesome God we have and what comforting lyrics!!I am in my deepest gloom away from my husband since 2 years and God is only near to me. I have no hope in him but only in God. He has abandoned me and doesn't want to come back to me. I have not been able to read Bible and pray for longer time as my soul is weary and the only best thing that has helped me is listening and singing to hymns of worship and comfort and knowing that I am not alone even in my solitude. He is alive and is with me in every passing moment. All Glory to our eternal God in Christ Jesus.</article>
	<article author="Mistyrose" email="brehaut47@hotmail.com" city="" provst="" country="" month="11" day="29" year="2015">I'm grieving deeply at the moment and am in a very dark place where I can't even pray or read God's Word. The darkest and silence is deafening. 
But just as I was waking early this morning, God brought this beautiful hymn to my mind that I haven't heard in years and I knew I just had to find the words and try and sing it.
So I found it here and cried my eyes out. Then, as I've read other comments, I've realized that God has worked in much the same way in many lives. People who are in deep pain, God comes to gently in the dark night of the soul and whispers to us to listen to this song as a beautiful reminder of us constant love and care.</article>

This song has been my guiding light and comfort for the last month but more so since October 26 when she almost died in the accident.
"Help me then, in every tribulation,
So to trust Thy promises, O Lord,
That I lose not faith’s sweet consolation,
Offered me within Thy holy Word.
Help me, Lord, when toil and trouble meeting,
E’er to take, as from a father’s hand,
One by one, the days, the moments fleeting,
Till with Christ the Lord I stand".</article>

As I walked in the rain I sang this song over and over, and it soothed my soul. It has a way of settling your heart in being reminded that The Lord will use every circumstance in our lives for good, if we have yielded our hearts to Him. Then our suffering can be for His glory, even if the reason we are in it is due to our own sin. To God be the glory!</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="2" day="26" year="2013">I took Lynne R's 2/25/2012 recommendation and bought the book. It has been a blessing. I look forward to waking up each moring to sing a new hymn. And I usually do not like daily devotionals.

Lynne shared a little of the story behind the hymn. Here's more:
Carolina Sandell Berg was never strong as a child, so she spent much time in her father's study and grew especially close to him. When she was 26, she accompanied her father, who was a parish pastor in Froderyd, Sweden on a voyage to Goteborg. As they stood on deck, the boat lurched and spilled Pastor Sandell overboard. The crew was unable to save him, and he drowned as his daughter looked on.
Berg was already well known for hymns she had published as a young girl, but this tragedy inspired many more. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>

	<article author="Brent Alderman" email="" city="Hedgesville" provst="WV" country="United States" month="7" day="9" year="2012">I recently had a leg amputated with months in the hospital, rehab and now home rehab. While on the exercise machines, I thought of the words of this song over and over (along with "My Faith Has Found a Resting Place" and verses from the first chapter of James).

As a testimony to God's grace, He has kept me and my family from anger, bitterness, depression, envy of others or confusion. Knowing that "the protection of His child and treasure is a charge that on Himself He laid" got me through many lonely times, but never has He let my faith waver (for His glory). "Day by Day" is such a well-worded and solidly biblical expression that I have sung for years, but now means more to me now more than ever.</article>
	<article author="Jackie" email="" city="Bloomington" provst="MN" country="United States" month="6" day="25" year="2012">My little sister called today and shared this song with me. I have been ill for over 11 years and getting weaker. I have been broken a couple of times over these years. I have found out of weakness. He is my strength. The words that Lina wrote are so true and she could have only known them as truth... by the life of God's Son in her through the Holy Spirit. To trust our Lord's promises. We see His kindness, love, mercy and nearness to us. I love what she says about, "All my cares He wants to bear to cheer me." She could not have found what she did in Christ, during the death of her Dad, apart from God's revealing love, grace and kindness for her. It is encouraging to know what we are like apart from God's grace. Because then; He is the One who gets the glory because we know it's not of us. This will be a favorite song for me now.</article>

I've known it for many years, and have found much comfort from it. However, sometimes we forget about some of the old hymns, with today's modern worship music.

We sing it often in the Lutheran Church where I am a member. I have it closely by me at my home office desk. My son recently died in an accident at the age of 26. We sang it at his funeral on Dec 22, 2010 just before Christmas. All attending were comforted by it.

	<article author="Elizabeth Reynolds" email="" city="Ottawa" provst="Ontario" country="Canada" month="3" day="11" year="2011">My dear late father, Lindsay Reynolds, taught us to sing this hymn together in the car on long trips when I was a little girl. We would all sing in parts, and Dad would be the organ- providing the bass. The memory, and the hymn has been a source of comfort and encouragement to for some fifty years now, as my strong and loving earthly father taught me to trust in the loving provision of my heavenly father, who will, in the end, make all things right. May He be your comfort.</article>

	<article author="Angela" email="" city="Waxahachie" provst="Texas" country="United States" month="11" day="7" year="2010">I have always known this was an amazing and very beautiful song. Recently it has really been helping me through some trials of my own. These trials will always be with us until we are with Christ. I have been very blessed to grow up around true Christians and around missionaries. I have friends that have died and put in prison in China and Indonesia for their faith. Let's never forget to pray for those we do not know that are facing persecution all over this world. We must be ready to face whatever God sees fit to bring our way and trust Him. Thank you to the one from Korea for the scripture reference. It blessed my heart. Acts 16:31, James 1:12....Let us be patient and trusting in God for one day we will mount up with wings as eagles! God bless all those who believe and who are seeking Him.</article>

	<article author="Dianne Burleson Phillips" email="" city="Shelby" provst="NC" country="United States" month="8" day="6" year="2009">I heard this song on a Gaither tape and was moved more than usual. For twenty-nine years, I have faced an unusual journey with the mental illness of my brother.  Along with some other trials, I was ready to give up, but when I heard this song, I printed it off and framed it.

In bold print and underlined are the words, "As thy days, thy strength shall be in measure," This is the pledge to me He made.

Now I am printing it and enclosing it to a dear friend, Ed Minor, who
is suffering more than I can describe from the problems of radiation on his kidneys. Ed and Mary Ann, his wife, are inspirations to all who visit, but the doctors need a miracle to stop all these infections or we ask that God provide the physicians with needed
knowledge.</article>
