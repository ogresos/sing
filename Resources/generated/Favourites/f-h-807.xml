	<article author="Elaine" email="boffine@sbcglobal.net" city="Lansing" provst="MI" country="United States" month="9" day="3" year="2014">Christian music is like breathing to me. It is not uncommon to wake at night singing a hymn in my mind. So when I sat down for devotions today it was not a surprised when this old song popped into my head prior to beginning. I could not find this song in any of my old hymn books so I was so grateful it was online and glad to see the rest of the hymn.
God is good.</article>
	<article author="Collin SDA" email="collinpetersensda@gmail.com" city="Johannesburg" provst="Gauteng" country="" month="5" day="8" year="2014">Open my mind that I may read
More of Thy love in word and deed;
What shall I fear while yet Thou dost lead?
Only for light from Thee I plead.
Silently now I wait for Thee,
Ready, my God, Thy will to see;
Open my mind, illumine me,
    Spirit Divine!</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="10" day="25" year="2013">In our busy lives we often miss the quiet promptings of God's Spirit. And when we do hear God speak, we often ignore the message. ... This hymn calls us to watch and listen, and then act on what we have seen and heard, sharing it with others.
Clara Scott was a music teacher who composed a great deal of instrumental and vocal music. She became known for her book of anthems, "The Royal Anthem Book", which was published in 1882. Her productive life of composing and teaching at the Women's Seminary in Lyons, Iowa, is evidence that her eyes and ears were open to God's leading and that she was ready to share what God gave her. We should be ready to do the same. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton
