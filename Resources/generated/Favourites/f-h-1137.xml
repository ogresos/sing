    <article author="Naomi" email="" city="Dunedin" provst="" country="New Zealand" month="10" day="9" year="2011">We'll soon see the Lord, as He is, face to face, We'll know Him as never before; But that touch today, healing our broken heart, in that day will be felt no more.

Wow! This song is so enjoyable! Lord we want to be filled with Your life! We want to know You in the most intimate way! Lord we are nothing without You! Praise You Lord!</article>
    <article author="L.C." email="" city="San Juan" provst="M.M." country="Philippines" month="1" day="16" year="2011">In the kingdom age and in the New Jerusalem, there will be no more tears, because the Lord Jesus will wipe them all away. The tears we have with the Lord in this age, will become so precious in the future. Truly, it will be so glorious in the future when we see the Lord face to face and we will be enjoying the kingdom age and tears will be no more, however, the tears we had with the Lord today will be most precious in eternity.

This is so encouraging, all the tears we have for the Lord today will be so precious in that day! Our situation is ever changing, but what matters most is if we are gaining Christ in whatever circumstances we are in. This is all that matters. CONTINUE ENJOYING CHRIST AS OUR SAVING LIFE AND REST TODAY. 

Hebrews 2:3 says,"How shall we escape if we have neglected so great a salvation, which, having had its beginning in being spoken by the Lord, has been confirmed to us by those who heard". Our Lord, with His wonderful person plus His splendid work constitute so great a salvation, a salvation that none of us should neglect today.</article>
    <article author="Frank Pytel" email="" city="Chicago" provst="Illinois" country="United States" month="6" day="28" year="2010">As I sing this hymn, I consider the hardships of life as a believer in a new way. Most of the time I want the sufferings to end as soon as possible. Yet in the midst of the trials there is something of Christ that can only be seen and experienced there. The writer calls these times "blest opportunities." It is at that time we "suffer with Christ" and know "the fellowship of His sufferings." There is a fellowship with Christ that can only be known in the troubles we pass through. One day when we see Him, we will no longer be able to know Christ as the sufficient grace in the midst of the thorns, because suffering will be turned to joy, and the tears will be wiped away.</article>
    <article author="William Mancia" email="" city="Bakersfield" provst="California" country="United States" month="3" day="8" year="2010">I love this song. It reminds me that whatever I have suffered from the moment I was born is nothing compared to my Lord's sufferings. His sufferings started from the moment He was born until He gave the last breath for me on the cross. I can't ever pay what He has done for me. Because of His love, I desired to live and suffered for Him. The day is coming when we will eat and drink together with Him in the new earth and new heaven.</article>
