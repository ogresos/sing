	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="5" day="29" year="2013">Reginald Heber was always trying to improve the music at the Anglican church he served in Hodnet, England. Though his superiors frowned on the use of anything but metrical psalms, Heber introduced hymns by Newton and Cowper and even wrote new hymns of his own. This one would impress Alfred, Lord Tennyson as the world's greatest hymn.
After serving 16 years as a parish priest in England, Heber accepted the call to become bishop of Calcutta, India.
The tune to which this hymn is sung is called "Nicaea", named after the church council that met in A.D. 325, which formulated the Nicene Creed and affirmed the doctrine of the Trinity. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>
	<article author="Betty Jane Bonn" email="" city="Dunlap" provst="Illinois" country="United States" month="9" day="4" year="2012">Sometimes I find that nothing in my soul--that is, nothing in my intellect, my emotions or my will--can deal with a particular situation. At that point of realizing that the issue can only be dealt with in the realm of the Spirit, I refuse to entertain the endless unprofitable circles of thought anymore. I have to let the Holy Spirit within my spirit gain the ascendency. I acknowledge the situation to be beyond my human ability by saying, "Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord," and just go to praising the Lord for His intervention and resolution of issues beyond my natural ability. How humbling it is to acknowledge that I can't "fix" everything. On the other hand, My heavenly Father invites me to contribute to resolution of thorny problems through the power of the spiritual activities of prayer and praise! Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord! I thank God for the author and composer of this hymn--and for this website which publishes both words and music for all of us--for even me!</article>
	<article author="Betty Jane Bonn" email="" city="Dunlap" provst="Illinois" country="United States" month="9" day="4" year="2012">My hymn book gives an alternative second line to verse one of this blessed hymn: "Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee."

There is also an added fourth verse:

Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God Almighty!
All Thy works shall praise Thy name, 
  in earth and sky and sea;
Holy, Holy, Holy! Merciful and Mighty! 
God in Three Persons, blessed Trinity!

Thank you for the music to which I can sing along--What a blessing!</article>
