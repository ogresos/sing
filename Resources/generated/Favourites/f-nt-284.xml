	<article author="Henry Francis B. Espiritu" email="" city="Cebu City" provst="Cebu" country="Philippines" month="9" day="6" year="2011">Praise the Beloved Lord that His love is always strong, tender and constant. He never forsakes us no matter how much we fail Him again and again. He is grace and mercy Himself. His nature is grace; His essence is just Unconditional Love. Every time I meditate on this hymn, my heart soars to the Realm of the Throne and I bare my own heart to the Heart of the Beloved Whose Love is the only refuge of all the pains and sorrows of existence. Every time I pray-read this hymn, my soul, like a renewed eagle flies to the boundary of the human and the heavenly, and I wait with impatient anticipation for the Beloved to take me to His inner chamber of communion and fellowship. "Loved with everlasting love!" Oh Thy love is everlasting while my earthly love is finite. "I am His and He is mine!" Oh for this divine union and mutual abiding in Thee! Oh my God who made me partake of Thy most innermost secret. Oh this perfect peace that throws away all sadness of this earthly existence; bringing me to the joys of my communion with Thee. I cannot fathom the depths of Thy love! The more I fathom it, the more I drown into the ecstatic bliss of Thy Divine reciprocation. The more I think of Thy love, the more I am amazed at Thy forgiveness and loving-kindness! What can I say but "Thank You" for loving me who is the most wretched of all Thy creatures. Had You not pursued and captured me, I would still be in the grips of my unhappy mind! Oh my Beloved, thank You again and again for this unmerited favor and love!</article>
	<article author="Valerie" email="" city="London" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="4" day="16" year="2011">To be loved with an everlasting love. And, I believe because He has taught us it is so. To rest in Him. Suddenly verse 2 just falls into place and is so real. The things of the world just fade away and is secondary to the things of Christ. Things that once were wild alarms or triggers cannot disturb our rest because verse three is living and real. Who can separate us from the Lord? While God and I shall be, I am His and He is mine. This hymn opens the ecstasy in just loving the Lord. So long as God is God and I am me... I am His and He is mine. HALLELUJAH!</article>

	<article author="Denny Imanuel" email="" city="" provst="" country="Singapore" month="10" day="10" year="2003">I am a young person with a lot of hope, dream, and ambition. One day the Lord came and dealt with my situation.

Everthing change abruptly, until I confess that all my hope, dreams, and ambition is just a piece of vanity. Only on Him we should settle our hope, dream, ambition. Only in Christ we found a perfect peace and rest.</article>
