	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="4" day="14" year="2016">This hymn, perhaps one of the most beautiful of all his compositions, was written by Mr. Bliss, 1873, after he had given up his musical convention work entirely and entered fully upon his lifework for the Master. It seems that it was only after he had given up everything and committed himself and all his gifts to the Lord’s service, that he was enabled to write such a hymn as this.
Bliss called the hymn 'My Prayer', but thousands in every Christian land have made it their prayer as well, and it will continue to voice a heartfelt want of millions in years to come.
The hymn was a special favorite with Mr. Moody, and was often quoted by him as a hymn that would live in the church of God, while the children of God continue to call upon his name in prayer.
Mr. Bliss was at the time of his death a member of the First Congregational Church of Chicago. The pastor, the Rev. Dr. E. P. Goodwin, in an address on the death of Mr. and Mrs. Bliss, referred to the singing of this hymn as follows: On one of the last occasions when he was with us, on a flying visit to our city, made during his work as an evangelist, he came in late one evening and sat at the rear of the church. Espying him, I called him forward to sing the hymn, ‘My Prayer.’ He struck the keys on the piano, stooped forward, and reading the words in the latter part of the first verse, 'More joy in his service', said "I do not think I can sing that as a prayer any more; it seems to me that I have as much joy in serving the blessed Master as it is possible for me to bear." - 'My Life and the Story of the Gospel Hymns' by Ira David Sankey

In stanza 1, the original says "strivings" instead of "sweetness".
In stanza 3, the original says "purity" instead of victory and "longings for home" instead of "quest for the throne".

The chorus was added later by the composer, Horatio Palmer.</article>

	<article author="Michelle Reyes" email="" city="Navotas" provst="Virac Catanduanes" country="Philippines" month="11" day="24" year="2010">For growth in Christ it must be our longing before the Lord. Indeed everything is of Him not by our own effort and strength. Longing more from the Lord that all the human virtues and divine attributes mention in this hymn will be added into us so that we will all be saturated by His divine life and will have the growth and maturity in life. Hallelujah for such Christ who is everything to us!!! Lord Jesus! Amen!</article>

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="28" year="2008">When we put these verses together, we can see that the Triune God—God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit—desires to make home in us and indwell us to become our inward joy and completely fill our whole being. The result of such a filling is what is mentioned in Ephesians 5:19, "Speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord." Therefore, the result of being filled with the Holy Spirit is to overflow with words of praise. The psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs referred to here by the Apostle Paul are not ordinary words. Therefore, we all need to learn. Recently, I heard that some of you are memorizing Bible verses. I hope that you would also memorize hymns. For example, consider the words from Hymns, #397:

More gratitude give me,
More trust in the Lord,
More zeal for His glory,
More hope in His Word,
More tears for His sorrows,
More pain at His grief,
More meekness in trial,
More praise for relief.

If these words are thoroughly memorized within you, when you are filled in spirit and moved by the Spirit, you will spontaneously sing out, "More gratitude give me, More trust in the Lord...." Sometimes you may not necessarily sing all three stanzas. It may be that you will sing only the last stanza and think of the Lord's return:

More victory give me,
More strength to o'ercome,
More freedom from earth-stains,
More quest for the throne,
More fit for the Kingdom....
