In his pocket he carried little cards on which he scribbled hymns in shorthand as he rode.
When a horse threw him, he wrote in his journal: "My companion thought I had broken my neck; but my leg only was bruised, my hand sprained, and my head stunned, which spoiled my making hymns till the next day."

The original 1st line of stanza 1 says "all loves excelling".
The original 3rd and 4th lines of stanza 2 say:
"Let us find that second rest.
Take away our bent to sinning;"
I prefer "promised" rest to "second" rest because it is more biblical, but greatly prefer "bent to sinning" over "love of sinning". As Christians we should no longer love sinning, but we still have an inclination to sin, which we hate.
The original 3rd &amp; 6th lines of the 3rd stanza say:
"Suddenly return and never,
...
Serve Thee as Thy hosts above,"</article>
