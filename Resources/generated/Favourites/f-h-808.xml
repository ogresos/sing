	<article author="KeepingHisWordsForever" email="" city="Columbus" provst="North Dakota" country="United States" month="11" day="27" year="2008">Our Master does speak. He speaks throughout His Word. When we come to the Word of God, we must turn our heart to the Father, to the Son and to the Holy Spirit in all prayer. 

We must love the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit! We must love the Triune God, and when we come to the words of God with our heart turned, the Spirit, the Interpreter of the Word, will make known to us the Interpretation, which is Christ, the Word of God. 

O saints, what unsearchable riches are in the words of God for us; for in every line upon line, precept upon precept the Spirit of Christ speaks to us. 

This is the way of true blessing, and true riches. There are wondrous depths of Christ for us to unearth in the Holy Bible, as we diligently labor in prayer by partaking of every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God, which words are our spiritual nourishment. 

"Thy WORDS were found and I ate them, and they became the joy and rejoicing of my heart." Such speaking, that is, the words of God, we must hear, and receive in all prayer and our joy will superabundantly overflow as the word of Christ dwells in us richly.

Yes, our Master speaks. Open your Bible today, and hear Him today!</article>
	<article author="Kevin Wardley" email="" city="Newcastle" provst="NSW" country="Australia" month="1" day="2" year="2005">This Hymn reflects the utter devotion to the Lord which F.R. Havergal exhibited. It reflects the desire I have to serve the Lord. It is the least I can do, in response to Jesus submission, and servanthood for His Father, and to those who who treated Him with contempt....See Deut 15:15-17, Mathew 20:28.</article>
