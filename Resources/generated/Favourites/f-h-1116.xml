	<article author="Rose Rowe-Taylor" email="r*******e@live.com" city="Birmingham" provst="West Midlands" country="United Kingdom" month="4" day="12" year="2016">What a wonderful God we have who just keeps giving and giving all He is and all He has to a people He so dearly loves and treasures! 
Now whenever I sing this song my being is full of profound appreciation to the Lord for the progress of His divine revelation concerning His Spirit from typology to reality; and all the processes He went through to accomplish that. These incense are just a typology of the Compound all-inclusive life-giving Spirit we enjoy today.
My experience and enjoyment of the Compound Spirit is deeper, sweeter and higher after the revelation received during the recent Crystallisation Study of Exodus. 
Let us praise and thank our God for the Ministry of the Age that opens up the word to us.</article>

While singing, it brings me into a richer understanding, deeper realization and application of the rich, blended, compound Spirit! May I experience this more and more!</article>
	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="2" day="6" year="2011">I would suggest that several brothers and sisters come together to practice praising the Lord according to the contents of Hymns, #1116. The first stanza of this hymn speaks of the resurrected Christ as the all-inclusive, compound Spirit, the reality of the holy anointing ointment portrayed in Exodus 30:23-25, composed of a hin of olive oil and four spices. The second stanza speaks of Christ as the incense with the three fragrant spices plus pure frankincense. The third stanza speaks of the function of the ointment toward us and of the incense toward God. If the saints practice for several weeks day after day, they will see the difference. Then in the meetings they will offer prayers and shout praises to the Lord, but in their shouting, there will be some incense, some substantial content of Christ. We should always have something of Christ in our prayers and in our praise. We should learn to compose our praise according to our experiences of Christ. Day by day we need to have some new experiences of Christ. Then all these new experiences will become a new vocabulary for us to compose a new praise to the Lord. This will refresh, enrich, and strengthen the meetings. If all that we can do is shout Hallelujah, our praises will lack newness and freshness. We need new experiences of Christ in order to offer new praises to God.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="25" year="2008">We have a short hymn in our hymnal that speaks of the two-way traffic between God and us and between us and God. The last stanza of this hymn, a hymn on both the ointment and the incense, goes like this:
...
This hymn well expresses the burden of this message. My burden is to show you the divine traffic; it is to help you see that God comes to us through Christ, and we go to God in Christ and through Christ. In fact, God's coming is Christ, and our going to God should also be Christ.

We need to be impressed with the fact that our going to God is our prayer. Perhaps you have never imagined that our going to God is our prayer and that this prayer should be Christ Himself.
