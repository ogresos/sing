And to those who have no vigor
He multiplies strength.
 Though youths will faint and become weary,
And young men will collapse exhausted;
Yet those who wait on Jehovah
Will renew their strength;
They will mount up with wings like eagles;
They will run and will not faint;
They will walk and will not become weary.
To wait on the eternal God
Means that we terminate ourselves.
That we stop ourselves with our living, 
Our doing, and activity;
Receive God in Christ
As our life, our person, replacement.
Receive God in Christ
As our life, our person, replacement.</article>

This morning I was just appreciating that morning revival is not for checking off a to-do list, but to spend time with a Person!</article>
