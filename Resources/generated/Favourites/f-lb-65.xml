    <article author="Frankie" email="" city="Chicago" provst="IL" country="U.S.A." month="10" day="6" year="2007">This is a touching song with a beautiful melody.  It is a song full of gratitude and appreciation of the Lord's love.

This is exactly how I feel listening to this song.  The Lord seeks me out even when I drifted away to seek other things in those past years.  His love is conquering yet so fine.

"Lord I love you more and more each day, Lord I love you more this very day...  All those years when I was void of you, Lord you rescued me when I was through."

"All those things that I have tried, left me thirsty and unsatisfied... till I drink you as my living spring."

"Lord I do love you, much more this very day."

There are no more appropriate words than what have already been said in this song.

Thank you for making home in our hearts, I have no ability to love You without You making home in my heart this very day.</article>

    <article author="Eunice" email="" city="" provst="New York" country="U.S.A" month="5" day="26" year="2005">I have been enjoying the Lord soooo much in the recent days. Nothing extraordinary, just normal days in His presence. Really learning the lesson of submission by not standing with my natural man but with Him on the throne for His interest. However, something happened to cause me to get into my mind, and I just could not shake it off so I decided to play the jukebox from this website and this song came on and just melted my heart. This has really been my experience. It just gave me an fresh appreciation toward the Lord and "how He rescued me when I was through". Praise the Lord! He is our Living Spring Who quenches all our thirst. Oh what sweet satisfaction! Lord I do love you, more and more each day.</article>
