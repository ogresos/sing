The story in the book of Song of Songs is also our story between our sweet intimate fellowship with the Lord. How sweet the intimacy is, that by His love and beauty we are drawn and run after Him lovingly. Remembering that He brought us into His chambers and there... He nourished us and partook His divine nature making the same as He is in life and in nature. For this reason we are united in love forever. Thus, by trusting and transforming until we become matured and hope to be raptured then to the extent we could say, COME LORD JESUS, we are waiting for You!</article>
