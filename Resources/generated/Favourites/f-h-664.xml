I grew up in the Plymouth Brethren (Tumbridge Wells) in Texas. I am now Anglo-Catholic and will introduce this to our Priest. Beautiful.</article>
    <article author="Isaiah Tor" email="" city="" provst="" country="Australia" month="9" day="19" year="2009">This hymn is very distinctive and crucial to our understanding of the Christian race. When we pray for sustenance, support and strength, do we do so as God directs our soul unto the glory and rest of Zion in Canaan? Often our entreaties before the Lord relates to the meeting of our needs as we dwell in this world, not as sojourners. When God directs our soul, we by implication deny our soul life in this age, in the hope that we would partake of Zion, the New Jerusalem in the next, and the provision described in this hymn, of all that He is as grace, is a sweet, abounding foretaste of that full portion that is to come. This hymn instructs us in this manner to reveal to us, our true position in this age, our portion in the next, and how presently the Lord wonderfully ushers us into the full enjoyment of Him in the next, in the midst of all affliction and frustration of that goal. Hallelujah!</article>

His strength protects us, heavenly springs shall there restore us, He feeds us with the Mighty's meat every day; Egypt's food no more to eat. May the Lord lead us to everlasting day. Amen!</article>
    <article author="Daniel Jackson" email="" city="Reading" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="12" day="3" year="2002">Oh, I enjoy this song so much! The Lord is directing our paths according to what is best for us, and according to His good pleasure. He does not merely just know our situation, He is directing it! This song touches every aspect of our human experience along this journey.

"Light divine surrounds thy going, God Himself shall mark thy way;"

May I be saved from ever doing anything that would interfere with His perfect will and arrangement! May I be saved from an individual view of my life - just for me and my intentions! Lord, have YOUR way!</article>
