	<article author="Sam" email="skwong626@gmail.com" city="" provst="CA" country="United States" month="8" day="29" year="2016">God created us to be the same as He is in life and in nature. He placed love in our hearts because He Himself is love. That is why I can't help but to love so many things. It is only through this can He deal with each one of us, showing us that His love prevails all things and reaches far beyond our understanding, yet gentle enough to embrace us when we turn back to Him. Lord, how I love You. I'm so happy to be in this sweet love story with you and all the brothers and sisters, living, inseparable, as one couple, eternally.</article>

Even though so many times I have not turned to the Lord, He still loves me! He fell in love with man and I have fell in love with Him!
This song touched me deeply and many other young people at a young people's conference. It is such a sweet song, both exposing my weak natural man and revealing God's unending and unchanging love.
Lord, thank You for Your love! How I love You! You are so lovely! I just love You!</article>

	<article author="R G" email="kevin_gorden61@yahoo.com" city="Grand Forks" provst="ND" country="United States" month="1" day="31" year="2015">This is a nice song, and much of it is truth. Some of it, however, borders on blasphemy. Jesus' love for us, though compared to a romantic love so humans can understand its depth, is not sensual, and it isn't appropriate to cast it in that kind of light. I will take artistic license in changing some of the words when I teach this song so it will be reverent rather than sappy.</article>

一个神圣、罗曼蒂克的故事

1. 一个伟大奥秘，
一则奇妙故事；
历世历代隐藏，
启示于祂智慧；
这（是）神圣罗曼史，
神人各按其时；
超乎所思所想，
显现于（亲见于）真神言语。

真神深爱世人——
惟有真神的爱，
使人有祂样式，
（共）同生命（共）同性情。
我们是祂表彰，
祂新妇、祂扩展；、
永远形影不离（成双成对），
如夫妻合而为一，
永不分离。

2. 纵使遭人弃绝，
瞎眼人拒绝祂；
祂爱宽容忍耐，
祂心坚定不变；
于是道成肉身， 
降世成为拯救（降世为拯救人）；
祂取名为“耶稣”， 
祂屈尊寻求我们。

3. 纵然诞生为罪身，
祂宝血救赎我。
在各各他（受苦）受难，
在荣耀中被提（提升）。
为着使我重生，
如今结合成一灵，
我爱慕享受祂，
因我罪得赦免！

4. 祂爱如此温柔，
我要向祂降服；
祂名如此宝贵，
我欢喜叫：“耶稣！”
祂品格何等迷人，
不住（永远）夺取我心，
我不再保留自己，
我要永远爱祂。</article>

After man commited sin, man is no longer worthy to be love, but hallelujah for such a great love of our God. 

As King of kings, Lord of lords, He chose to became a man just to be mingled with man. Man has always been the object of God's heart's desire. Hallelujah for the love of God that continues to constrain us. He is the only worthy One for our love.</article>

It's so amazing how even after seeing condition of man's heart, His love is still unchanging for us, and is able to transform us completely. Praise God for His awesome amazing love.</article>

	<article author="Joey Ting" email="" city="Melbourne" provst="VIC" country="Australia" month="6" day="9" year="2008">Recovery Version of the Bible, Revelation 22:17, note 1:
The entire revelation of the Bible shows us the love story of a universal couple. That is, the sovereign Lord, who created the universe and all things, the Triune God - the Father, the Son, and the Spirit - who went through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, and who ultimately became the life-giving Spirit, is joined in marriage to the created, redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite man - composed of spirit, soul, and body - who ultimately constitutes the church, the expression of God. In the eternity that is without end, by the divine, eternal, and surpassingly glorious life, they will live a life that is the mingling of God and man as one spirit, a life that is superexcellent and that overflows with blessings and joy.

Praise the Lord!</article>

	<article author="Lily Liu (Chun-I, Liu)" email="" city="Houston" provst="TX" country="originally from Taipei, Taiwan (H23)" month="3" day="14" year="2007">In winter of 2003, we went to visit a new church in north Philippine just established by FTTM trainees. One night, we joined their homemeeting in a house where Philipine trainees gathered young people in that locality. Those young trainees were teaching young people this song, we were singing with them.

At that very moment, Lord came to me and asked me in an intimate yet strong way, "would you be willing to serve me in a place like this(there is countryside of Philippine)?" I knew that I cannot and was not willing to serve the Lord in a place like that, I am a person who like to pursue better living standard. However, when it came to the fourth stanza," His Love is so tender, to Him, I'll surrende;..., His person's so charming, my heart ever winning; I'll hold back no longer, I'll love Him forever." My heart melt because of His love and experienced that the love of Christ constrain me, I no longer live to myself but to Him who died for us and has been raised. To His asking, i gladly said "yes". I knew I cannot but He can, He is the One who empowers me inwardly not outwardly. This very God fell in love with us and He WILL make us His expression, His bride and His enlargement, forever together living inseperable as one couple eternally. This is OUR DESTINY.

Now I do serve the Lord in a form not as a full-timer but a graduate student, not individually but corporately in priesthood.</article>

The greatest mystery on earth, that the religions will never knows. God is love, and thus He has fallen in love with man since men has fallen in the begining unto eternity.
