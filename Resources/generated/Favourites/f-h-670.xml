	<article author="Cheryl Brady" email="" city="Stevens Point" provst="Wisconsin" country="United States" month="2" day="9" year="2016">I am laying awake tonight wondering what song to sing for my dear, sweet mother's burial later this week, and this song came to mind. Indeed, what joy and comfort we have in the precious name of Jesus! He is the Hope of us left behind here on earth, and the Joy of my mother in Heaven!</article>
	<article author="Horrilia Trust" email="horriliatrust@gmail.com" city="Port Harcourt" provst="Rivers State" country="Nigeria" month="12" day="4" year="2015">This hymn during morning devotion this morning gave me a renewed hope. The last half of last year and most months of this year have witnessed many deaths amongst family and friends of mine. But today I cease to cry like those without hope. I wish most worship centers will go back to hymns. They're simply divine and inspiring. God bless the memories of Lydia the composer for today words she wrote almost 160 years ago brought me hope and joy.</article>

	<article author="Richard A. Joyce" email="ricartuc@yahoo.com" city="Querétaro" provst="" country="Mexico" month="5" day="11" year="2015">I awakened this morning singing this song, although I hadn't heard it for many years. The original stanza that says, "King of Kings and Lords we'll crown Him when our journey is complete" has been a choking point for me for a number of years. If I understand my Bible, when the Father said to Jesus, "Sit at My right hand until I make Your enemies Your footstool," Jesus became King at that moment. He will not be king when He returns, He is NOW king. I love the revised version of those lines, "Claim His victory over evil/And the enemy defeat." It speaks of a triumphant Church applying Calvary's victory to earth's current distress. Awesome.</article>

When our journey is complete. 
This is true, but I like what it says here better: claim His victory over evil, and the enemy defeat.
Faith is the living power that passes through every barrier, overrides each obstacle, and plants its banner in the heart of the enemies' camp.</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="3" day="12" year="2014">Born in Petersburg, NY, Lydia Baxter was saved as a young person. She and her sister later established a Baptist church in their hometown. After marriage, she moved to New York City. Although bedridden for much of her life, her home was open to preachers, evangelists, and Christian workers, who came to her for inspiration and advice. This hymn was written 4 years before her death in New York City. - Songs of the Spirit by Martin
---------------------
The original 3rd and 4th stanzas are a little different:
3 O the precious Name of Jesus!
 How it thrills our souls with joy,
 When His loving arms receive us,
 And His songs our tongues employ!
---------------------
4 At the Name of Jesus bowing,
 Falling prostrate at His feet,
 King of kings in Heav’n we’ll crown Him,
 When our journey is complete.</article>

	<article author="Lady Brown" email="" city="Kissimmee" provst="Florida" country="United States" month="10" day="26" year="2012">This hymn is sung in our divine worship services on Sundays. It is a very anointed song. Hymns such as this is a lost art; and is not favored in these new age ministries. The young people cannot relate. This is why I make it my duty as a Child of the Most High King and as a Worship leader to preserve these priceless hymns by introducing them at worship services. May the Lord be glorified, His children be edified, and the devil horrified.</article>
