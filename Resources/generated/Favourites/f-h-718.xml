	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="3" day="18" year="2014">Edward Henry Bickersteth was born in Islington, England, the son of Edward Bikersteth (compiler of Bickersteth's Christian Psalmody 1833). He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, and was eventually ordained an Anglican minister.
In 1875, Bickersteth heard a sermon on Isaiah 26:3, "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on Thee." After hearing this sermon he went to visit a dying relative. In order to comfort the troubled man, he sat down and wrote the poem "Peace, Perfect Peace" and then read it to him. The son of the author said, "The most touching occasion on which, personally, I ever heard it sung was round the grave of my eldest brother, Bishop Edward Bickersteth (of South Tokyo) at Chiselden in 1897, when my father was chief mourner" (One Hundred and One Hymn Stories by Price). He is also known for his writings consisting of 12 books of sermons hymns and poetry. - Songs of the Spirit by Martin
---------------------
There are 2 additional stanzas at the end:
Peace, perfect peace, death shadowing us and ours?
 Jesus has vanquished death and all its powers.
------------------------------
It is enough: earth’s struggles soon shall cease,
 And Jesus call us to Heav'n’s perfect peace.
----------------------
After one of Bick­er­steth’s sis­ters point­ed out that there is no­thing spe­ci­fic in the hymn about phy­si­cal suf­fer­ing. “That is soon rem­e­died,” he re­plied. He took up an en­ve­lope and wrote the fol­low­ing verse (ap­par­ent­ly ne­ver pub­lished) on the the back…:
---
Peace, perfect peace, ’mid suffering’s sharpest throes?
 The sympathy of Jesus breathes repose.</article>
