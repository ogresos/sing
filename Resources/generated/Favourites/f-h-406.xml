一　求主教我認識你的道路，
借恩使我得知你的道路；
在你光中直前，
憑信，不憑眼見；
求主教我認識你的道路。
二　勿讓憂疑越過你的道路，
風浪不能淹沒你的道路；
縱有雲霧遮蔽，
苦痛、艱難襲擊，
仍要讚美不輟你的道路。
三　此生久暫全在你的定奪，
苦樂於我無礙—由你掌握；
直至賽程告終，
榮耀賞賚接領，
仍要俯伏敬拜你的道路。</article>

	<article author="Ketty" email="" city="" provst="" country="Uganda" month="2" day="13" year="2015">As I woke up this morning this song was on my heart. I could not recall all the lyrics so I quickly looked it up in my hymn book. It was not in the book. So I did a Google search and found it. Amazing how technology is creating quick solutions.</article>
	<article author="Frances Cullen" email="frances.cullen@gmail.com" city="Leeds" provst="West Yorkshire" country="United Kingdom" month="11" day="13" year="2013">Wonderful to find this on the internet - not in any of my hymn- or songbooks. Don't sing it nowadays, there are all new and syncopated songs. It was going round my head and I couldn't remember all the words.

However as the pianist has now been playing it endlessly for the past 10 minutes without flagging, I think I'll have to pull him gently off the piano stool... You can get too much of a good thing!</article>
	<article author="Ed, Nation Of The Gathered Children Of God" email="sonwhoserves@gmail.com" city="Indianapolis" provst="IN" country="United States" month="9" day="27" year="2013">Just now, Our Lord is yet again the Teacher of His way--teaching me to love my brothers and sisters all over the world with a newly-felt love, even with tears, as I read of the love of His bride for the Bridegroom.

Thank you my brothers and sisters, for through you and your precious words of Love for Our Lord, does He teach me to love you more deeply; and I pray He will ever teach me His way more perfectly...to love you as He loves you.

In HIs undying love and grace,
Ed

   John 11:52  And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad. 
   Acts 10:35  But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him. 
   Philippians 2:15  That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world; 
   1 Peter 2:9  But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light: 
   Revelation 5:9  And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; 
   Revelation 7:9  After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;

	<article author="Joel" email="" city="Woodburn" provst="IN" country="United States" month="9" day="27" year="2013">God laid this hymn on my heart last night while I was laying in bed so I got up this morning and looked up the words. The melody and lyrics were such an encouragement. It is a simple prayer. God's ways are not our ways. That's why we must "learn" them. Father, teach me Thy way!</article>
	<article author="Gnik" email="tking6@fuse.net" city="Cincinnati" provst="Ohio" country="United States" month="7" day="17" year="2013">A little depressed today and when singing through the lyric, it really brought tears out. Lord never promised a rose garden but He did promised that He will never forsake us. We have to follow His lead, listen to His words and learn to be like Him. (there are 2 verses on my copy)</article>
	<article author="Jen Yeo" email="" city="" provst="Sarawak" country="Malaysia" month="9" day="16" year="2012">God spoke to me through this hymn today at the Sunday Service, I was deeply moved. For months, I feel helpless and the problems keep adding up, but I know Lord You will carry me through eventually. 'Live more by faith and less in sight' is a lesson I need to learn and obey until the journey's done, until the crown is won.</article>
	<article author="Vivian McClellan" email="" city="Auburn" provst="WA" country="United States" month="8" day="7" year="2012">Three mornings in a row I woke up with this hymn coursing through my brain. I decided God was speaking to me through it, so I looked it up here and was blessed by it all over again.</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="7" day="8" year="2012">The Lord wants us to know His ways, not just His acts and commandments, though we surely need to keep all His commandments that apply to the New Testament age. We are assured that the Lord answers all prayers that are according to His will (1 John 5:14), so He will answer the prayer of this song, but the answer will most likely take us through sufferings as this song says. 

This song's prayer is the same that of Psalm 25 (Ps 25:4-5,8-10,12,14). Ps 25 is the 1st alphabetic psalm. I think the reason for the alphabetic psalms is to make them easy to memorize. Thus, as said by Matt, this is a very good hymn/prayer to memorize. It will help us to endure trials that will surely come in our life. We will learn the Lord's ways through the experience, and there will be sweetness in it.

I called this hymn today at our church's Lord's Table. We sung it twice. A brother told me that this was the best hymn I had ever called.</article>
	<article author="Matt" email="" city="Nottingham" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="5" day="21" year="2012">Learnt this at Sunday school when I was young and today it all came back to me and gave great comfort. :) A very simple hymn to memorise and such strong words, so glad to find it here when I checked I had remembered it right!</article>
	<article author="The Voice" email="" city="Freetown" provst="Lowerpipeline" country="Sierra Leone" month="4" day="14" year="2012">Wow our choir master taught me this song a few years back he's gone now but this song inspired me in many ways.</article>
	<article author="Sheila" email="" city="Newtownabbey" provst="Co Antrim" country="United Kingdom" month="3" day="12" year="2012">I memorised this hymn as a teenager about 40 years ago.  I have returned to it time after time in all the various trials of life. It never fails to uplift me, This was my prayer as a young person, and God has been faithfully answering it through all sorts of trials. "He is faithful that promised."</article>
	<article author="Margaret" email="" city="Bonham" provst="Texas" country="United States" month="2" day="3" year="2012">I have been given many blessings in my life, thank You Jesus. But singing isn't one of them. I would love to hear it .</article>
	<article author="Nigel Morrison" email="" city="Sunderland" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="11" day="12" year="2011">This hymn is so special. It is the camp hymn of St. Gabriel's church camp. 100 years old this year. 
The organist from St Gabs added a fantastic descent for verse three. 
This is my farewell hymn.</article>
	<article author="Timothy" email="" city="" provst="" country="Singapore" month="10" day="11" year="2011">I was first introduced to this hymn 37 years ago, as a teenager. It touched the core of my heart. The cry of my heart then is my same cry today. "Teach ME Thy way O Lord." However much I've learned, there is a new light, a deeper truth each passing day. This same cry will remain till I leave this earthly life.</article>
	<article author="Caleb Don Crigger" email="" city="Theodore" provst="Alabama" country="United States" month="10" day="5" year="2010">Today my cry is to be humble and open to HIS every leading and direction.

	<article author="JJ" email="" city="Oxford" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="2" day="7" year="2010">I love this song because it reminds me that there is a crown to be won at the end of the journey.
