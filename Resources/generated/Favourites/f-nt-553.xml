I really appreciate stanza three, which says that we tell Him all our doubts and griefs and fears. This touches the Lord as the great High Priest. He is inwardly moved and motivated by our weakness to take action to care for us. All our weakness intensifies His intercession for us. The result is our spirit is uplifted and cheered. We should never be afraid of our weakness and doubts, but bring them to the Lord. Eventually we will be saved to the uttermost by our wonderful High Priest. Praise the Lord Jesus!!</article>
