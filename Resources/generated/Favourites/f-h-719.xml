	<article author="Marlene" email="mjwillis52@gmail.com" city="Montgomery" provst="TX" country="United States" month="6" day="5" year="2015">On having my quiet time this morning, I suddenly realized some of the phrases from this hymn were going through my mind but I couldn't think of the name or anything more than those few words. I googled those along with "hymn" and I found this site. What a great tool! I'm very excited to find it. The hymns are gradually being forgotten and they are so rich in teaching and encouragement. Thank you!</article>

Been stressed and have been going through life journey ignoring Him. Putting all in a balance I've come to realize that living with heaven in view matters and gives you unexplainable satisfaction in life. I've asked for forgiveness and I know He has heard. May His mercy and grace keep us in Him.</article>

All for us to do
They who trust Him wholly
Find Him wholly true.
Amen! Thank You, Lord that we may trust You wholly and find that You are wholly true!</article>

You are indeed a most loving and gracious God! Every good and perfect gift comes from You and You sovereignly orchestrate every event in my life. Thank You Lord for choosing for me. I thank You for my auto accident that no one else was hurt and that You have forgiven me and brought me so much closer to You. You put a hymn in my mind today "Lord lead me to some soul today" and brought me to this site. please forgive me for not using the time You've given me wisely in the past and please use me Lord to lead others to YOU, that You might receive all the glory and honor due Your Name. I love You Lord and I desperately want to honor You every minute of every hour for the remainder of life. Thank You, Lord. Amen.</article>

It is truly amazing. I have always been blessed by hymns, but today was led through my devotions to the thought of peace...true peace amidst many storms in my life. Thank You, Lord, to directing me to this site. I guess I found it after googling the hymn, O this full and perfect peace. Thank You, Lord.</article>
	<article author="Betty Jane Bonn" email="" city="Dunlap" provst="Illinois" country="United States" month="10" day="30" year="2012">This hymn about the peace of God that passes understanding reminds me of another beautiful old hymn, "Wonderful Peace." I offer to you the words:

       Wonderful Peace

Far away in the depths of my spirit tonight
Rolls a melody sweeter than psalm;
In celestial-like strains it unceasingly falls
O’er my soul like an infinite calm.

Refrain

Peace, peace, wonderful peace,
Coming down from the Father above!
Sweep over my spirit forever, I pray
In fathomless billows of love!

What a treasure I have in this wonderful peace,
Buried deep in the heart of my soul,
So secure that no power can mine it away,
While the years of eternity roll!

I am resting tonight in this wonderful peace,
Resting sweetly in Jesus’ control;
For I’m kept from all danger by night and by day,
And His glory is flooding my soul!

And I think when I rise to that city of peace,
Where the anchor of peace I shall see,
That one strain of the song which the ransomed will sing
In that heavenly kingdom will be:

Ah, soul! are you here without comfort and rest,
Marching down the rough pathway of time?
Make Jesus your friend ere the shadows grow dark;
O accept this sweet peace so sublime!

God bless you all who are "stayed upon Christ Jesus."</article>

	<article author="John White" email="" city="West Chicago" provst="IL" country="United States" month="9" day="15" year="2012">I was feeling rushed this morning and was reminded of this song. So, I googled it and sang along. Just what I needed today. Thanks.</article>
	<article author="Don Lair" email="" city="San Diego" provst="CA" country="US Virgin Islands" month="4" day="15" year="2012">When the tune and lyrics and the subject matter are all in perfect harmony, how can one not be blessed? As this hymn focuses upon one of God's commands to pray without ceasing, the love we have for Jehovah (Christ Jesus) is shown only in our obedience to His Word.</article>
	<article author="Annette" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="8" day="2" year="2011">I also grew up singing it "Stayed upon Jehovah..." One of my very favorite hymns.</article>
	<article author="william" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="2" day="25" year="2009">Original was: 'Stayed upon Jehovah, hearts are fully blest'</article>
	<article author="Jenny Richardson" email="" city="Webster City" provst="Iowa" country="USA" month="2" day="24" year="2008">I have always heard it sung "staid upon Golgotha hearts are fully blessed..." but why i love this song is for all the beautiful promises, and truths of God's character</article>
