Keep on singing, songs get deep down in our being, then in time of need, just as a deep well, it will spring forth living waters to refresh us and those who hear.....
Sing, sing, sing!</article>

	<article author="Becky Briden" email="beckybee316@gmail.com" city="" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="2" day="10" year="2014">Gen. 2:10 says: "A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and there it divided and became four rivers."Ps. 46:4 says: "There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy habitation of the Most High." Ps. 84:2 My soul longs, yes, faints for the courts of the LORD; my heart and flesh sing for joy to the living God." Words of a thirsty heart. The Living Water must flow through us in order for us to be a blessing to others. The river in Eden aided Adam in tending the Garden of Eden. The Lord is the Master Gardener who aids us in tending His garden. We are the channels in which He flows. May His river of delights course through us spilling over as a blessing and source of eternal life to others. Psalms 36:7-10 "How precious is your steadfast love, O God! The children of mankind take refuge in the shadow of your wings.  They feast on the abundance of Your house, and You give them drink from the river of Your delights.  For with You is the fountain of life; in Your light do we see light.  Oh, continue Your steadfast love to those who know You, and Your righteousness to the upright of heart!" AMEN!</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="6" day="7" year="2013">In the original, the word "power" was used instead of "grace". We need both.
In the chorus, 2nd line, "grace" was "pow'r".
The last line of the chorus was "Ev'ry day and ev'ry hour."
In the 3rd stanza, "strength" was "pow'r".
In the 4th stanza, "grace" was "pow'r".</article>

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="27" year="2008">We are not in a movement. According to Hymns, #268, we are channels for God's Spirit to flow through us into others. If we visit the new ones in their homes every week, what is deposited into them will be with them for the rest of their lives. Even if we answer their questions with a few simple sentences, our answer will remain in the deepest part of their being. They may ask a simple question about dealing with their parents; if we are weighty, even a simple response will give them a deep impression. Our response will change their human life. This is what we must give people when we contact them through door-knocking. We must be prepared to do this.
