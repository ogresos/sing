Instead of stanza 5 above by Gibbs, the original concluded with the following 2 stanzas:
5 Where'er I go I'll tell the story
 Of the cross, of the cross!
 Of nothing else my soul shall glory
 Save the cross, save the cross!
 Yea, this my constant theme shall be
 Through time and in eternity,
 That Jesus tasted death for me
 On the cross, on the cross!
-------------------
6 Let every mourner rise and cling,
 To the cross, to the cross!
 Let every Christian come and sing,
 Round the cross, round the cross!
 There let the preacher take his stand,
 And, with the Bible in his hand,
 Declare the triumphs through the land,
 Of the cross, of the cross!</article>
