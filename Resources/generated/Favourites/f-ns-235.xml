I therefore run but as a servant be, 
so I box, not as beating the air.
I buffet my body and beat it as a slave, 
lest having preached to others, I disapproved become.
I do all things for the sake of the gospel 
That I may become a fellow partaker.
Enjoying the gospel, a joint participant
Enjoying the gospel, a partaker of it.</article>
