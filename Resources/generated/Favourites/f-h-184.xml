	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="12" day="27" year="2014">Montgomery was born in Scotland of Irish Moravian parents. When he was 12, his parents were sent as Moravian missionaries to the West Indies, where they died. He was then sent to a Moravian seminary, but due to his preoccupation with writing poetry he was dismissed. Eventually he became an editor of a newspaper and was imprisoned for his controversial views. He continued to write in prison and eventually published many poems called "Prison Amusements." In time, he was recognized and given an annual pension by the British government. Montgomery was a deeply spiritual man, but he was not assured of his salvation until the age of 43. After this, he rejoined fellowship with the Moravian brethren. - Songs of the Spirit by Martin
He was unmarried.

The original stanza 1 says:
Come, let us sing the song of songs—
The angels first began the strain—
The homage which to Christ belongs;
Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!
---------------
There are 2 additional stanzas between stanzas 2 &amp; 3 above:
2b To Him who suffered on the tree,
Our souls, at His soul’s price, to gain,
Blessing, and praise, and glory be:
Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!
---------------
2c To Him, enthroned by filial right,
All power in Heaven and earth proclaim,
Honor, and majesty, and might:
Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!
--------------
The last stanza is a little different in the original:
Long as we live, and when we die,
And while in Heaven with Him we reign,
This song our song of songs shall be:
Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!</article>
