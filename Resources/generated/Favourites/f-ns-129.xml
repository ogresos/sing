This hymn is lovely to sing to The Lord and warms my heart so much toward Him. It feels with each stanza I open my whole being to Him more. By the end my spirit is agreeing with the corporate prayer of "Jesus come quickly, we're waiting for You". Oh may I be one of the wise virgins preparing for the return of our beloved Bridegroom!</article>
