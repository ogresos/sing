    <article author="Gonzalo Garcia" city="Jamaica Estates" provst="New York" country="United States" month="4" day="22" year="2008">I was listening this song with my little daughter Julia but after 2 minutes I consider that this song is also for me, because without a clean conscience is very dificult to see,the conscience is the window and the brigde where the the Spirit spread into our mind,emotion and will.Also the conscience is the leading part of our spirit.</article>
