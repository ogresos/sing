	<article author="Anna Gibbs" email="jasperpeipei@gmail.com" city="Denton" provst="TX" country="United States" month="12" day="29" year="2014">When I was 14 years old, I read Madam Guyon's Letters. Her love for the Lord touched me deeply. Since then, I became a crazy lover of Christ. 
Now I am 71, I still love Him with all my heart! What a lovely song this is!</article>

	<article author="Sabina Rusike" email="sabinarusike@yahoo.co.uk" city="London" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="5" day="21" year="2013">Oh Lord thank You for loving us. I have realized how weak and empty I am. I am weak to love and follow You. I need You Lord as my strength to energize my whole being to love and follow You. Oh yes the Joy of the Lord is our strength. My, You fill us Lord with all that You are so that we would love more so with our first love. Amen.</article>
	<article author="Sherry" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="2" day="24" year="2012">Yes, this hymn is very true. How many times have I sang "I love You, Lord and I lift my voice..." only to have my heart echo the emptiness of the words. My love would burn and wane with the flickering flame of circumstance. His committment to hang on to me through all the stormy gales is the only sure and certain hope we have. Blessed be God and our Father who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</article>

	<article author="Esmonde Lim" email="" city="Petaling Jaya" provst="Selangor" country="Malaysia" month="5" day="23" year="2008">We worship God by just loving Him! Not with our own love, but with His love! By Thy love I live.</article>
	<article author="Kyra Cattelan" email="" city="Canaan" provst="Ct" country="United States" month="4" day="30" year="2008">I enjoy this hymn because it matches experience. When I first began walking with the Lord, I claimed a never fading love to Him. Time, failures, and environment all caused my natural love to fade. Yet God's faithfullness never changed. And now there is this day, when we sing " I love You Lord, but with no love of mine for I have none to give!"   Through experience one begins to realize that not only can't we Love Him on our own, but we wouldn't even want to love Him with anything less then His perfect, unspeakable love. Like wise we pray that His love is our love toward all man kind.Praise God His love is His life imparted into us! I have realized when all is said and done this is the only love that will ever be able to carry a foolish thing like me. Thank You Lord that we can love You back  with Your love! And mostly thank You Lord!  that we can experience Your love each and everyday, through every circumstance, today in this age!!! May each one of us be saturated and soaked with Your love each day! Amen Lord.</article>
	<article author="Joyce Lin" email="" city="Wilmington" provst="DE" country="U.S.A." month="7" day="16" year="2005">This hymn is so true! We really do not have any love in us. We love Him because He first loved us. Our love for His is a reflection, an echo of His love. Lord Jesus, fill me with Your wonderful love!</article>
	<article author="Hymnal.net" city="" provst="" country="" month="12" day="6" year="2013">We no longer need to follow the detour today, for the Lord has opened the way to the tree of life. However, the condition of most Christians is that they are still in the detour. If we do not have a revelation of the tree of life, we will exhort people saying, "Brother, you need to be watchful. Sister, you should be subject to your husband. We must deal with the flesh, accept the breaking, and accept the cross. We need to be like Madame Guyon." Such exhortations are in the detour of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Even Madame Guyon was in this detour. She pursued the Lord and was built up, but eventually God still had to strip everything away. When she was stripped by God, she could say, "I am as nothing, and rejoice to be / Emptied, and lost, and swallow'd up in Thee" (Hymns, #546). There is no need for a redundant step. It is better to not build than to build up and then tear down. God stripped her of everything and left only Himself. Therefore, she said that she was lost in Him. However, these words do not hit the mark. Man is not lost in God but mingled with God. By God's mercy Madame Guyon touched this reality, but she did not have sufficient light and did not know the confirming word in the Scriptures.

A person who takes the detour must eventually come out. The detour is about doing things. The Lord has enlightened us to see that we do not need to take this detour. The Lord said, "I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes into Me shall by no means ever thirst" (John 6:35). He also said, "He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing" (15:5). These verses reveal that there is no need to stay in the detour. We need only to eat and drink the Lord: "He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me" (6:57). How I wish I could repeat these verses until every believer sees that man needs nothing but to eat and enjoy the Lord. A. B. Simpson said that everything is in Christ and that Christ is everything (Hymns, #513). Healing is Christ, power is Christ, and patience is Christ; everything is Christ. But his words did not yet hit the mark and are not very clear. No one has ever told people, "God needs man to eat Him; man needs to eat God." Only this word hits the mark and is clear.
