    <article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="1" day="31" year="2014">I was appointed [by D. L. Moody] to assist George C. Needham in his work in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, and later, with Charles Inglis of England, I was sent to one of the smaller churches of South Chicago. On entering the railway station on my way to this 2nd appointment, I found Mr. and Mrs. Bliss waiting for the train I was to take.
While bidding goodbye to Mrs. Stebbins and our son, then a small boy, Mr. and Mrs. Bliss were reminded of their 2 boys in the home of friends in Rome, Pennsylvania, and tears came to their eyes.
After leaving Chicago, Mr. Bliss fell asleep, with his head resting on his wife's shoulder. He was still sleeping when my destination was reached. As I rose to pass out, I said to Mrs. Bliss, "Don't disturb him." She replied: "Oh, yes! He would be disappointed if he did not say goodbye." as he wakened and realized I was leaving, he followed me onto the platform with kindest wishes and parting words.
This proved to be the last time I saw him, for he and Mrs. Bliss at the conclusion of the meetings at Peoria, went to their children to spend the holidays, and on their way back to Chicago, a few days later, they met their tragic death at Ashtabula, Ohio. - Reminiscences and Gospel Hymn Stories by George C. Stebbins, composer of the music of 22 hymns at hymnal.net
---------------------
There is an additional stanza:
No need of the sunlight in Heaven weâ€™re told;
 The Light of the world is Jesus!
The Lamb is the Light in the city of gold,
 The Light of the world is Jesus!
-----------------
In this last stanza, I would change "Heaven" to "glory" because the New Jerusalem is not heaven, but comes down to earth.</article>
