His fame, however, came from his literary efforts. After writing "Old Ironsides" at the age of 21 and launching "The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table" series at 22, he quickly gained fame as a writer.
In December 1859, the last of his papers making up "The Professor at the Breakfast-Table" appeared. He concluded with these words: "And so my year's record is finished. ... Peace to all such as may have been vexed in spirit by any utterance the pages have repeated. They will doubtless forget for the moment the difference in the lines ... and join in singing this hymn to the source of the light we all need to lead us."
Then he printed this hymn, which has been called "the finest sentiment of God's omnipresence in the English language." - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>
