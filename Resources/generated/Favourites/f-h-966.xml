Upon further review of the entire song, there was a renewed feeling of longing. We do love Him and yet other things might busy us away from the pure hope of being with Him, of being like Him and of His personal reward to each who 'sacrifice' today for Him. If we just continue to press on, day by day to "go out of the world to meet Him", Jesus our Lord, then more and more we will enter into the rich experience of this song. As to the world, self and sin, we groan and long to be released. As to Him, we just want to be "where He is". This is His promise to those who serve Him today: "If anyone serves Me,....Where I am, there also My servant will be." John 12:26</article>
