	<article author="Gerald R. Chan" email="" city="Baguio" provst="Benguet" country="Philippines" month="4" day="3" year="2011">I realized that it is not how long we are in the church life, what matters most is our growth in life. Everyday we need a little injection of Christ, an intimate fellowship with our dear Lord, thru these more of His divine elements will be added into us. We need to empty ourselves so that he could have a way to fill us.</article>
	<article author="John Thompson" email="" city="Hamilton" provst="" country="New Zealand" month="2" day="27" year="2011">Lord, do teach us to pray in Spirit and by the Spirit. This first verse of this song is so true. There are so many people and nations that pray in vain. They pray for themselves and not for building of God's economy.

Lord, be the centre and reality in us, causing us to pray in Spirit. Turn us from our worldy ways in order for You to grow more and more in us.</article>
	<article author="Karen Murray" email="" city="" provst="Michigan" country="United States" month="2" day="5" year="2011">Praise the Lord for His life. He is our High Priest. This reminds me of Hebrews 7:16-17, and 7:7. "Who has been appointed not according to the law of a fleshy commandment but according to the power of an indestructible life. For it is testified, You are a Priest forever according to the of Melchizedek." Verse 7, "But without dispute, the lesser is blessed by the greater".</article>
