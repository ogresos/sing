	<article author="Tom" email="tchelimsky@mcw.edu" city="Milwaukee" provst="WI" country="United States" month="6" day="11" year="2016">Rejoice in the Lord with exceeding joy! Trust Him with every ounce of your being. You will never be disappointed. Never. What a great song and so well played. We sometimes get sad about our sin, and condemn ourselves. But this song says it all. Rejoice in your weakness!! Why? Because of God's power shown in the blood of Christ. This song is full of eternal joy as we also can be, even in sin! The blood is greater than our sin and can lift us right out of the mud, right out of our garments stained with sin, into our new Garment, Christ Himself. What joy! What power! Can we take this all in? Can we rejoice fully in our weaknesses like Paul? Hallelujah!</article>

In the dream, my late uncle raised this song when the band was fumbling with their instrument and could not raise a music for the guests. When I woke up, I was moved to google the song and I found this. Thank you so much, the piano version was excellent. I had another opportunity to reflect on the wordings. They are reassuring. Thank God for His grace to us. Amen.</article>

	<article author="Tom" email="tchelimsky@mcw.edu" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="5" day="12" year="2013">It's in the URL address line in your browser, very last phrase. For example, for this hymn it says: http://www.hymnal.net/en/hymn/h/1007. So 1007 is the hymn number. Since I am answering your query, I will also make a comment.

What a great song. Are you FULLY trusting in his grace this hour? I have to admit to my shame, I am a partial truster of grace. It's grace +. Grace + a back-up plan; grace + my clever working; grace + an influential person. But then I am short-changed of what I receive. Henceforth, let it be grace alone. Let me FULLY trust in his grace hour by hour, so that I need nothing else.</article>
