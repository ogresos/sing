	<article author="Janefrances" email="eemmilia@yahoo.com" city="Abuja" provst="FCT" country="Nigeria" month="3" day="20" year="2015">I was feeling bad that the advice I gave to a colleague of mine who call me Mum and I call her "my daughter" was interpreted wrongly and used against me with the intention to ruin my career. I got relieved from the hurtful pain inflicted in my heart by her when this song was sang in the morning Mass I attended two days after the incident and immediately I got into my office, I googled it and here it is.</article>

	<article author="Nsisuk O. Ekanem" email="nosmekgroup@yahoo.com" city="Auchi" provst="Edo" country="Nigeria" month="11" day="24" year="2013">It was Christ the King day in 2003. I gave a testimony in my native church about the manifest presence of God in the life of a true Christian. I was remarkably raw in my short exhortation. I got home and at night about 0055hrs I was woken by a beam of light incident on my eyes from my window. Behold a black African mamba (serpent) had appeared in my bed room and had climbed my left legs and I shook it off. I praised God that morning and this hymn ministered to me immensely as I sang it repeatedly with excitement. My help comes from God who made heaven and earth.</article>

	<article author="Christopher" email="" city="Ibadan" provst="Oyo" country="Nigeria" month="6" day="16" year="2012">Of the few songs that still linger in my soul from my minor seminary days, this is a top choice. Years after, a pentecostal, I find the lyrics thoroughly delightful. It still blesses me. Another that blesses me is "Most Holy Trinity!"</article>

	<article author="Sunny Emman Akintomide OLAMILOKUN" email="" city="Lagos" provst="" country="Nigeria" month="6" day="10" year="2011">It was some time in 1962, while in a primary school in Makera Baptist School Kaduna Nigeria that my music teacher taught us this song. Early on 10 June 2011, exactly 3 years when I dropped my uniform as a naval officer with an admirable career in the Nigerian Navy, the lyrics of this song kept coming to me. I was urged to go back to the lyrics and I googled it to find the lyrics with this wonderful tune. Certainly, it is a call for evangelism as all we love may fade away. Jesus is Mine and I profess.</article>
