Wesley responded, "Who is this that pleads for the devil?" and he rebuked the man in the name of Jesus. That night Wesley went to bed thinking about the name of Jesus. This hymn he wrote during that night. -Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton

Stanza 5 in the original starts:
His only righteousness I show

There are 2 additional stanzas inserted before the above stanza 5:
O that my Jesuâ€™s heavenly charms
 Might every bosom move!
 Fly, sinners, fly into those arms
 Of everlasting love.

Thee I shall constantly proclaim,
 Though earth and hell oppose;
 Bold to confess Thy glorious Name
 Before a world of foes.</article>
