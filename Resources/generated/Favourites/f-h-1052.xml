	<article author="Joyce" email="joycekaruri@yahoo.com" city="Kerugoya" provst="Kirinyaga" country="Kenya" month="7" day="10" year="2015">A few years back the Holy Spirit spoke to me and urged me to lead a group of distant prayer partners to worship and pray using this song to bring back to sanity a son of one of our members. By morning of the following day I was receiving a message that the boy had become as calm as a dove and since that time he has never gone back to his strange wayward ways. Join me in singing it to restore a daughter of a friend. She is married as a 3rd wife to an illiterate, abusive man. Her mother is so disturbed and has high blood pressure as a result. I will share the miracle with you. Thanks and be blessed.</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="11" day="6" year="2014">Born in Ireland, Kirkpatrick spent most of his life around the Philadelphia area where he served as music director in various Methodist churches. He is said to have compiled 100 gospel song books. -Songs of the Spirit by Martin
Kirkpatrick wrote this song at a camp meeting in Rawlinsville, Pennsylvania, with a very specific purpose: to win the soul of his soloist, a nonbeliever. After Kirkpatrick prayed for the young man, these words came to him. He wrote them down quickly, and after the soloist sang them that night, he became a Christian.- Winning Songs by John J.
