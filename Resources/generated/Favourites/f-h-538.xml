Praise the Lord, we already have our beloved Christ as Spirit who indwells in us. Amen.</article>
	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="8" day="17" year="2011">God's good pleasure is what makes God happy. It is what God likes, what pleases God. We have a hymn in our hymnal which speaks of God's intent and pleasure (see Hymns, #538). God has predestinated us unto sonship according to the good pleasure of His will (Eph. 1:5). This means that God likes to have sons. His predestination is unto sonship. Unto means for or in view of. God's predestination of us is for His sonship or in view of His sonship. God is happy and glad about gaining sons. It is His good pleasure to have us as His sons.

God has made known to us the mystery of His will according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Himself (Eph. 1:9). First, there is God's will, second God's purpose, and third God's pleasure.
