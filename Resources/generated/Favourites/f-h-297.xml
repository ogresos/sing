    <article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="" month="5" day="3" year="2014">Born in Denmark to a prominent English merchant, Chapman was educated to be a solicitor, but felt called to be a minister of the Word. He began reading the Bible diligently at the age of 16. 4 years later he received the Lord through the preaching of Harrington Evans. His friends said he would not make a good preacher, however his response was, "There are many who preach Christ, but not so many who live Christ; my great aim will be to live Christ." in his 99th year he spoke, standing for 1 hour. He was a minister of the gospel with the Plymouth Brethren at Barnstaple, England. Chapman preached the gospel in Barnstaple and all the villages in that area of Devon. He was also burdened to preach the gospel in the Roman Catholic countries of Spain, Portugal, and Ireland. He travelled by foot around those countries, passing out Bibles and preaching the gospel.
In England, Robert Chapman wanted to establish a home that could be a place of rest and encouragement for discouraged and tired Christian workers. For this purpose Chapman bought a row-house in a poor section of Barnstaple. Chapman lived at that address for the next 70 years (he never married). Many Christian workers stayed there for short or long periods, while Chapman ministered to their spiritual and physical needs. For 65 years he maintained close fellowship with George Mueller. He wrote 165 hymns and poems. Robert Peterson comments on Chapman: "What then made Chapman so beloved and effective in his time? Quite simply, his utter devotion to Christ and his determination to live Christ." - Songs of the Spirit by Martin

The original 2nd stanza says:
In heaven the blood forever speaks
 In God's omniscient ear;
 The saints, as jewels on His heart,
 Jesus doth ever bear.</article>

Why? because Christ took what should have been ours, the condemnation was all taken by Him at Calvary. This is one of the many precious truths in the Roman Epistle.</article>
