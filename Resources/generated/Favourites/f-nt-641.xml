We wonder how we can ever accomplish anything that He expects us to do and everything He expects us to live, but the answer is simply, "CHRIST IS MY LIFE!"

If you're in touch with your spirit, this life will just flow out! He died to win this life for us, now we just have to take it by faith.

Then we just become channels, transparent vessels, expressing what we have within.

So, "Praise Him that the gift is thine!
Then go forth to live each moment
On sufficiency divine!"

Thank You Lord, it can be SO SIMPLE!</article>
