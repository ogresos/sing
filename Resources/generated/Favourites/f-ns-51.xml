	<article author="Matt Ma" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="26" year="2009">King David had a desire for God's heart, which is His building. Yet the Lord let him fell to the deepest pit in David's life, and now, David fully realizing his situation, with all that Jehovah had done for him in view, cried out to God, and had the deepest, and most absolute repentance. 
His transgression and repentance with the forgiveness of the God issued in a marriage, which brought forth Solomon, the peaceful one, the beloved, who is the builder of the temple of God. 
In our Christian life, we will have experience like David, where we fall and think how can I have done this. Then we will have the most genuine repentance, our natural man will be dealt with, and we will never boast because we know our source is like Solomon. The builders of the Temple of God must have this kind of experience.
So saints, never be discouraged. Come, boldly to the throne of grace.</article>
