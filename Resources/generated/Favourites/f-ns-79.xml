	<article author="Bridge Aughenbaugh" email="" city="San Carlos" provst="California" country="United States" month="2" day="27" year="2012">The gospel of John reveals that Christ is the Word, the eternal God (1:1), who passed through a long process eventually to become the breath, the pneuma, that He might enter into the believers. For the accomplishment of God's eternal purpose, He took 2 steps. First, He took the step of incarnation to become a man in the flesh (1:14), to become the Lamb of God to accomplish redemption for man (1:29), to declare God to man (1:18), and to manifest the Father to His believers (14:9-11).  Second, He took the step of death and resurrection to be transfigured into the Spirit that He might impart Himself into His believers as their life and everything for the building of His Body, the church, the habitation of God, to express the Triune God for eternity.

It is for this very reason I give myself to Him by calling on His name. By calling on Him, I enjoy Him anytime and anywhere! Oh Lord Jesus!!!!!!! I love You!!!!</article>
