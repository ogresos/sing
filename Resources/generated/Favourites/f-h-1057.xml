	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="Michigan" country="United States" month="5" day="19" year="2016">"This is the crown of Charles Wesley's work - one of the greatest hymns of the universal church. The finest hymn of the English Language." - John Telford in "The Methodist Hymn Book Illustrated"
Henry Ward Beecher said, "I would rather have written that hymn of Wesley's, "Jesus, Lover of My Soul", than to have the fame of all the kings that ever sat on the throne. It is more glorious. It has more power in it. That hymn will go on singing until that last trump brings forth the angel band; and then, I think, it will mount up on some lips to the very presence of God."
One of the greatest preachers of the Gospel in England at the beginning of the 20th century was Hugh Price Hughes. He left instructions in his will that they should inscribe on his tombstone, "Thou, Oh Christ, art all I want!"
Charles Spurgeon said that on one occasion an unGodly man stepped into Exeter Hall when he was holding services. He came to Christ when they sang, "Jesus, Lover of My Soul." "Does Jesus love me?" he asked. "Then why should I live in enmity to Him?"
Dr. Duffield, who wrote the hymn, "Stand Up for Jesus", tells us that he had drifted away from the Lord and was brought back by this hymn. "One of the most blessed days of my life," says the hymn writer, "was when I found, after I had hung my harp on the willows, that I could *sing* again; that a new song was put into my mouth; and when, e'er ever I was aware, I was singing, 'Jesus, Lover of My Soul'. If there is anything in Christian experience of joy and sorrow, of affliction and prosperity, of life and death - that hymn is the *hymn of the ages*!"
Mr. Sankey tells us it was the last hymn that D. L. Moody sang before he entered into the joy of his Lord.</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="2" day="19" year="2014">One afternoon on a Hudson River liner out of New York, Sankey was singing this song to a gathering of people, when a man came to him excitedly out of the crowd. "Were you in the Union Army?" the man asked.
"Yes, I served in Maryland."
"Were you at such and such a battle?"
"Yes."
"Could you have been singing that hymn one night while you were on sentry duty?"
"Yes, I even remember the night," Sankey told him.
"And I remember having a bead on you, but hearing you sing that great hymn I could not squeeze the trigger." - Songs That Lift the Heart by George Beverly Shea

There is an additional stanza following stanza 2 above:
Wilt Thou not regard my call? 
Wilt Thou not accept my prayer?
Lo! I sink, I faint, I fall—
Lo! on Thee I cast my care;
Reach me out Thy gracious hand! 
While I of Thy strength receive,
Hoping against hope I stand, 
dying, and behold, I live.</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="7" day="17" year="2013">This is a different aspect of background to the song from that posted by LY 6/22/2013:
Written only a year after his conversion, this is one of the most famous of Charles Wesley's 6,000 hymns. As he wrote it, he may have been remembering his turbulent transatlantic crossing 3 years earlier. He wrote in his journal, "The sea streamed in at the sides ... it was as much as 4 men could do by continual pumping to keep her above water. I rose and lay down by turns, but could remain in no posture long; strove vehemently to pray, but in vain." Later in the afternoon as the storm reached its peak, he said, "In this dreadful moment, I bless God, I found the comfort of hope."
Wesley talked to another passenger about trusting God, and the passenger replied that he had no refuge in times of danger. Even though Wesley was ill and frightened, he had the awareness, as he later wrote, that he "abode under the shadow of the Almighty." - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>
	<article author="LY" email="" city="Boston" provst="MA" country="United States" month="6" day="22" year="2013">Here's the background to this lovely hymn: Mrs. Mary Hoover, of Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, whose grandmother was the heroine of the story, has related to her pastor this family tradition: Charles Wesley was preaching in the fields of the parish of Killyleagh, County Down, Ireland, when he was attacked by men who did not approve of his doctrines. He sought refuge in a house located on what was known as the Island Barn Farm. The farmer’s wife, Jane Lowrie Moore, told him to hide in the milkhouse, down in the garden. Soon the mob came and demanded the fugitive. She tried to quiet them by offering them refreshments. Going down to the milkhouse, she directed Mr. Wesley to get through the rear window and hide under the hedge, by which ran a little brook. In that hiding-place, with the cries of his pursuers all about him, he wrote this immortal hymn. Descendants of Mrs. Moore still live in the house, which is much the same as it was in Wesley’s time.

	<article author="Frank Pytel" email="" city="Chicago" provst="Illinois" country="United States" month="5" day="22" year="2010">For me to get into this hymn, I needed to sing it over and over in a quiet place. The Spirit showed me Christ in a double way. First, Christ is the one who loves my soul in the hardships of life (verses 1-2). He is my refuge who supports and comforts when all becomes so difficult. Second, when the corruption of my nature seems so present, Christ is the only One I want, and He is more than all I need to be healed and set free (verses 3-4)! I can cry to Him when the situations of life are hard from without; I can abide in Him when I realize how terrible I am within! He is sufficient in every way!</article>
