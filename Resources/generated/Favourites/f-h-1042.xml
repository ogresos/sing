When He came to me in the gospel, pleading and knocking on my heart, I refused and resisted with silly excuses that I knew were nothing. Or, maybe it was the fear of not knowing what would happen after I opened and believed. After refusing repeatedly, my thought was, "what if He stops coming, and I don't ever have the chance to hear the gospel again?" It was as verse two says,"Do not risk another day." The conviction of "Why not now?" became so strong that I couldn't refuse any longer. Let us "pray and plead", not giving up on anyone as we persuade them to come to Christ!</article>
