	<article author="Christine Mannell" email="christine_mannell@hotmail.com" city="Eastbourne" provst="East Sussex" country="United Kingdom" month="5" day="4" year="2015">I was in our prayer meeting yesterday evening and the 2nd verse came to me, then the 3rd - I had to google it to remember the 1st verse.. Here I am trying to work out what God is saying and the last comment, made yesterday is very similar. We occasionally sing 'hymns' but I can't remember the last time I heard 'Fight the good fight'. I think the focus was on 'lift up thine eyes and seek His face'.</article>
	<article author="Jean Deakin" email="jeankdeakin@gmail.com" city="Wolverhampton" provst="West Midlands" country="United Kingdom" month="5" day="3" year="2015">This morning some lines from this hymn came to me from the last two verses. I looked them up and found they from this hymn Fight the good fight. I went to church and found the last hymn that we sang was Fight the good fight, (not a hymn we usually sing) so I'm sure God must be saying something to me.</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="9" day="6" year="2013">John Monsell was a gifted Anglican clergyman who could hold his congregation spellbound as he spoke and who advocated "more fervent and joyous" singing in his church. He once said, "We sing, but not as we should, to Him who is the chief among 10,000, the altogether lovely."
This hymn was written to accompany the reading of Ephesians 4:17-32, where Paul outlines the nature of new life in Christ. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown and Norton</article>
	<article author="testimonyislife" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="15" year="2008">This hymn says so much to you and I. We must fight the good fight, as we lay hold on eternal life. And, run the straight race through God's abundant grace, as we lift up our eyes to seek and behold His face. Care must be cast aside whatever betide as we lean on our Guide. Put all our trust in Him, and fear not, but believe. Our Christ is our way and our wonderful, complete Salvation. Hallelujah!</article>
	<article author="KeepingHiswords" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="1" day="19" year="2008">This hymn is important, because it speaks of a believer's life, which is a life of trust in the Lord, and a life in the power of His might. It is a life in faith against all the power of the enemy. It is a life of victory over all the power of the enemy. And, it is a life in union with Christ, and it is not a life apart from Christ. Christ is our strength, our might, our right, our eternal joy and crown, our path, our prize, our life, our love, our Guide, and He is all in all to us.</article>
