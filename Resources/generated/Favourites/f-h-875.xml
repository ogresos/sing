It is the praise at midnight that will glorify my Saviour. He who trusts in Jesus is more than conqueror. The enemy cannot defeat us because the Lord has already done it all; we are more than conqueror's through Him who loved us and brought us into Himself by His work on the cross. Thank You Lord Jesus for Your death and resurrection and for Your most precious blood! We love You Lord!</article>
