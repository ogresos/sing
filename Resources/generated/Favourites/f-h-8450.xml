1. Our spirit was born of the Spirit - 
John 3:6b - That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.

2. Our spirit worships God who is Spirit - 
John 4:24 - God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.

3. The Spirit is the Word -
Ephesians 6:17 - And receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God, 

4. The Spirit is filling us and will flow out of our innermost being as rivers of living water -
John 4:14 - But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water gushing up into eternal life. 

John 7:38-39a - He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. But this He said concerning the Spirit,

Amen!</article>
