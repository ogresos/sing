Now I found the church meeting here in Japan, again I want to renew my consecration for your gospel work here. May You use me as a functioning member of Your Body. I consecrate my whole being for You alone, because You are my FOCUS and My GOAL. Praise You Lord there is a wonderful church life in the whole universe. Truly You are the living God walking in every locality. I don't want to be a Sunday goer or church goer every meetings but a fruitful Christian expressing You wherever I go. Living in You in my idle time and loving Your Word as my very sword to fight the enemy. Do preserve my love ones, my own family gained them for Your testimony. Take my life, and my everything to be use by You. Amen!</article>
