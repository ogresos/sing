Blessed Jesus, take me, own me, make me, keep me wholly Thine. Once we let go and give oneself completely to Him the struggles cease and then we have rest.</article>
	<article author="Catherine" email="" city="Bellevue" provst="Washington" country="United States" month="6" day="6" year="2016">"Lord, make this a reality in me! I belong to Jesus and I am not my own." In struggles and pains we turn to One who knows well the human sufferings of life, Jesus Christ our Savior. Once we allow Him the way in us we can fully rest in Him as our life and life supply. When we stop our struggling and let Him be the King in us can we know real rest. I am still learning to let go and to let Him be the Leading One in me.</article>

I have the Spirit within, so I am sealed and belong to Christ alone (Rom. 8:9). So as I live, I live to Lord, or if I die, I die to the Lord, I am the Lord's (Rom. 14:7-8). "Oh, the blessed rest it brings us to belong to Christ alone." All is yours, and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's (1 Cor. 3:22-23).</article>
