God brought this song to my heart this morning to lift my Spirit and to let me know He is aware of my situation and He is in charge. Glory be to Jesus for evermore!!!
Let's be encouraged. God knows about whatever we're going through and He won't give us more than we can bear  (1 Corinthians 10:11). Hang in there, He will make a way of escape for us.</article>

Be blessed my brother in the Lord. There are many believers in Jiddah. I lived there for three years. There are several Churches there and 7,000 who have not bowed the knee to Baal. You may be there with no Bible. There are Bibles in the churches; I know because I lived in Jiddah for three years. Pray that you may find them. Seek and you will find; knock and it shall be opened. In the Scriptures it is written: "In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer because I have over come the world." Greet all the brethren for me. Tell them that I will never forget them until we sing together again in the Kingdom. Remind them to continue "Standing on the Promises of God." Tell all the Pastors and Deacons that I love them dearly.</article>
