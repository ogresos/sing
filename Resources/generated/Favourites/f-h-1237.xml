	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="4" day="1" year="2008">First Corinthians 1:9 says that our faithful God has called us into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ. The word "fellowship" includes the thought of enjoyment. Sometimes people may celebrate something by having a party. For us to fellowship together is to have a "party." A party is a fellowship. The Christian meeting may be considered as a Christian party. Every meeting is a party to us. I am interpreting the word party in a very positive sense. A party is an enjoyment. If we are at a party, you will enjoy me and I will enjoy you. We will share our joy and feelings with one another. We are so happy when we are meeting with the saints because our meeting, in a positive sense, is a party.

In our hymnal, there is a hymn about the church life which begins, "I'm so happy in this lovely place" (#1237). It is hard to enjoy such a hymn by ourselves. If we were at home alone in our living room, it would be difficult to sing, "I'm so happy in the living room." But if you are in a small group meeting of ten to fifteen saints, you can declare—"I'm so happy!"—because you are having fellowship, a party. This party is not like the parties in the world with sinful and worldly things. It is a party of the Son, Jesus Christ. We are enjoying Him. We are happy with Him and happy because of Him. We are so happy because He is our joy. He is our enjoyment. Our fellowship, our enjoyment, our party, is to partake of, to participate in, the all-inclusive Christ. The faithful God has called us with a purpose. This purpose is that we may participate in His Son, Jesus Christ. This means that God has given us Christ and that He has called us into the enjoyment of Christ.
