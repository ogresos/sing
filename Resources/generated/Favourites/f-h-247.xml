This hymn was composed in the privacy of her bedroom, where she had no paper or pen so she used her diamond ring and wrote it on a window pane.
She wrote other poetry included in the book "Spirit of Psalms" in 1829. Some other hymns she wrote are:
Bright was the guiding star that led
Hasten, Lord the glorious time
Sweet is the work, O Lord
With joy we hail the sacred day
