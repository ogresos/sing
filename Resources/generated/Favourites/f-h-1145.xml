	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="24" year="2008">The oneness that God desires with man is illustrated by what takes place when we eat, digest, and assimilate food. When you eat a sandwich, your stomach works to digest and assimilate the contents of that sandwich. Another word for this process is dispensing. Digestion and assimilation are dispensing. After a few hours, the sandwich disappears within you to become one with you. Eventually, the sandwich is mingled with you. This is the kind of oneness God desires to have with man. To obtain this oneness God has made Himself edible. He is the bread of life (John 6:35, 57). The first stanza and chorus of hymn #1145 in Hymns say:

God gave His Son to man to be
The tree of life so rich and free,
That every man may taste and see
That God is good for food.
Yes, God is good for food!
Yes, God is good for food!
We've tasted and we testify
That God is good for food!

Our God is good for food. He is not only good for salvation and redemption; He is also good for food. In John 6:51 Jesus said, "I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever." In the wilderness the children of Israel ate manna every day (Exo. 16:14-15, 21). They lived on that supply of manna for forty years. In the Gospel of John, the Lord Jesus revealed Himself as the real manna. He should not be eaten only once a year but every day. Jesus is our daily manna. We must eat Him every day.

We need to eat Him every day, and we need to be revived by Him each day. In the ancient time, the Israelites had to collect the manna before the rising of the sun, because when the sun became hot, the manna melted (Exo. 16:21). It is the same with our practice of morning revival. We must rise up early. If you are lazy and like to sleep late in the morning, you will miss the manna. You need to rise earlier, before the rising of the sun, in order to pick up Christ as your daily manna. You must eat Christ. This is the divine thought in the divine Word.
