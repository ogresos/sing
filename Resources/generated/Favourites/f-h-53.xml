How precious! Our God and Father, we respond anew to love in Christ revealed and praise Thy Name! I respond anew this morning, Father God, to Thy love. In Christ, Lord Jesus, this morning I consecrate myself to Thee. How beautifully simple and yet so integral to our well-being. We are nothing apart from Thee, oh Lord! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!</article>
