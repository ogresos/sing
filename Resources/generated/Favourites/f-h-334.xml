	<article author="Doreen Yeukai Rwanyanya" email="" city="Harare" provst="Harare East" country="" month="4" day="30" year="2013">Continuation: We left and get back home. The following day my husband and I went for morning glory at church. Our theme was "every altor against my life catch fire". We were pushing in prayers and I felt dizzy and couldn't pray anymore.
Indeed there was fire everywhere. After prayers I went and see my pastor, instead of telling him what I encountered, he is the one who narrated everything to me. He told me go home and decide on a name that I would give the child in my womb and pray commanding him to live. He told me that I wasn't going to miscarry but will have that baby to show the goodness of the Lord. Days came so as months, the ninth month came and there were no signs of labour. We prayed and asked God to intervene. Two weeks later I went a see my gynae and insisted that I be induced for labour. On the 6th of march I was induced for labour and delivered a bouncing baby boy, the one whom I was told that he never existed and also after I was told that am not going to conceive again. I am an Omega Child, the Child Of fire. I named the Boy SHILOH (GOD SENT) the name I dreamt of when the pregnancy was a month old and also which was prophecied about when I was in the sixth by my pastor. Surely I will sing in my rapture Glory to God for such a Redeemer as mine.</article>

He hideth my life in the depths of His love and covers me there with His love. This became my song when I was told that at the age of 24, I wasn't going to conceive again because there was water in my pelvis. Can you imagine how it got there? The devil is a liar. I went to see my pastor (Pastor Paul Adogamhe) and told him what I've encountered, he asked me a simple question: "whose report do you believe, is it God's or man's report?" I was challenged and it made me to focus on the Lord who is Jesus Christ. He prayed for me and after a month I missed my period and decided to have a pregnant test. It was confirmed that I was pregnant, I was overjoyed and I knew that the dry and thirsty land have been overshadowed. Three months down the line my inlaws visited me and decided to visit a white garment prophet. I told them to go and see my pastor but they refused and insisted that I should go with them to a white garment prophet. When we got there he said to me, "Madam you feel nauseous like a pregnant woman, there is nothing in your womb, I want to give you holy water so that you will clean your womb after that you will conceive..."</article>

My soul is touched and refreshed. I'm reminded that I have a safe place, a place of peace and joy, in the cleft of the rock.

	<article author="李 菲 麗" email="" city="" provst="NC" country="United States" month="11" day="15" year="2012">I am deeply and prayerfully touched by this hymn! [The cleft of the rock signifies the cross. Christ was the cleft rock smitten for us (Exo. 17:6; 1 Cor. 10:4). Hence, the cleft of the rock signifies His crucifixion, and His crucifixion is just our cross. We must remain in the cleft of the rock; we must stay in His crucifixion. The Apostle Paul was always experiencing the death of Christ. He said, "I am crucified with Christ" (Gal. 2:20). He also shared that he was "always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus,...For we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus' sake...So then death worketh in us..." (2 Cor. 4:10-12). This is what it means to be the dove in the cleft of the rock. Only a long period of time in this experience can bring us to the next stage. (Life and Building as Portrayed in the Song of Songs, Chapter 5, Section 3)] O Lord Jesus, always keep me in 'the cleft of the rock,'! Amen! via http://www.ministrybooks.org/</article>

	<article author="Louise Wiens" email="" city="Leamington" provst="Ontario" country="Canada" month="6" day="17" year="2011">We just returned from a trip to the Grand Canyon, one of the 7 wonders of the world. Pictures cannot adequately describe the beauty of it. Only God could sculp something of such grandeur! As we were at a lookout point I noticed this large rock with a sharp angular jut, and immediatley knew that this must be what they call a "cleft". Immediately I thought of this hymn, and the promise that the Lord hides our soul in the cleft of the rock. Surrounded by miles of dry desert with no shade in sight, this cleft cast welcomed shade onto the structures beneath it. If it had not been deemed as being dangerous, I would have loved to have climbed over there and sat for a while! How great is our God!!</article>

I sat on the rocky beach one morning distressed and alone and from behind me I heard a rippling waterfall. I immediately thought of these words and at that moment my wonderful Saviour brought me out of my despair and heartache. I knew He would take care of me. The past 20 years have been very difficult at times, but I never forget this song. In these days I'm experiencing what most women go through and it has taken away my joy.

	<article author="June" email="" city="" provst="" country="Ireland" month="4" day="18" year="2004">I love this song because I really think Jesus is a wonderful Saviour; He came to me when I was a poor, lost, lonely seven-year-old and He rescued me from a life not worth living, from standing on the edge of the harbour planning to jump in.  He has always forgiven me for all my failings as a Christian.  Having not been brought up in a Christian home made it difficult at times to fit in and be accepted by other Christians who have misunderstood my actions and behaviour from bad conditioning, but thank the Wonderful Saviour, He understands us at all times and can find out nothing about us that will put Him off us.  I just cannot begin to tell you how wonderful it is to have known him for 43 years and He is more precious to me now than ever before.</article>
	<article author="Jen" email="" city="Queensland" provst="" country="Australia" month="2" day="15" year="2004">I like John, being brought up in a Christian enviroment, was a brainwashed Christian for 28 years, and not knowing any better. Then the Lord said "Be still" by causing a problem with my feet. During this time I had felt the Holy Spirit convict me and lead me into the way and the plan the Lord had for my life. So I have a wonderful Saviour who waited and protected me for many years, until it was His time.</article>
	<article author="Joyce Jackson" email="" city="Salt Lake City" provst="UT" country="U.S.A." month="9" day="9" year="2003">I discovered I had a large ovarian cyst which had to be removed immediately and was told after the surgery that it was cancerous. The surgery team concluded that I need a complete hysterectomy which I definitely did not want and found out later I did not need. I had been recruited from another state for the job in which I was currently working and had no family or friends to lean on for support or comfort. This song made me realize that I had a friend "who sticketh closer than a brother." The Lord came to my aid and made me know I was not alone.</article>

	<article author="John Seyfert" email="" city="" provst="New York" country="U.S.A." month="1" day="25" year="2003">I like this song because Jesus IS a wonderful Savior! I had had a false profession for over 20 years. When after all that time I saw my life tailspinning out of control, the Lord convicted me that I was really lost all that time and drew me towards the Saviour. My biggest problem at the time was that after all the gospel preaching I'd heard over the years and never truly repented and turned towards Christ in faith, I thought maybe God would not accept me. My pastor told me that God would not convict someone He didn't want to save. That made sense and after a short time, I came to know the Lord for real.

So yes, Jesus IS a wonderful Savior! THANK YOU, LORD!!!</article>
