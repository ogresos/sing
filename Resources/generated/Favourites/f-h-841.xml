It's from a book LSM online publications The Central Line of the Divine Revelation, Chapter 7, 6, and 4,
The Spirit is the oneness of the Body of Christ, being the essence of the Body, which is constituted with Christ as the element, out from the origin of God the Father, to consummate the mingling of the Triune God with the Body of Christ through the divine dispensing (Eph. 4:3-6). Christ is the element of the Body, and the Spirit is the essence. This element is out from the origin of God the Father. Thus, with the Body of Christ, the Father is the origin, the Son is the element, and the Spirit is the essence. This is the Triune Godâ€”the origin, the element, and the essence. These three are blended and mingled with the Body of Christ.
Christ as the embodiment of God is very real; He is the reality (John 14:6). The Spirit also is real and is called the Spirit of reality (v. 17; 16:13). He is invisible, but He is real. When we touch Him, we touch something real. Anything real has substance, and any substance has an element. Within the element is the essence. When we eat food, we take in some substance. In that substance there is an element, and within that element there is an essence. Upon entering our body, the essence renews and transforms our body into another form. This renewing is transformation.
The essence of the element of a substance is its extract. Orange juice is the extract of an orange. When we drink the juice, we receive the essence of the orange. The Spirit as the processed Triune God is the essence. God has been processed so that we can take Him in. This is the reason that God is triune. He has to be the Father for planning His economy, He has to be the Son for the accomplishment of His economy, and He has to be the Spirit to be the extract of the Divine Trinity. As the Spirit He is available for us to enjoy and receive. When the Spirit is with us as the essence, we have the Son as the element and the Father as the nature.</article>

	<article author="Eunice Garcia" email="" city="" provst="NY" country="United States" month="6" day="16" year="2008">I appreciate the fact that we do not need to struggle or strive.  As we see from the book A "Deeper Study of the Divine Despensing", God's Law of the Spirit of Life operates spontaneously and softly.  We just need to hand ourselves over to God's law.  After Satan entered into man, man's natural law became distorted, either we do not love the Lord or we expect to be a "saint". Hallelujah for the grafted life that spontaneously  grows as we allow it to according to it's Law!  Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!</article>
	<article author="Ruth Austboe" email="" city="Anaheim" provst="CA" country="United States" month="6" day="16" year="2008">I was so touch by these sentences. "God's law of the Spirit of life does not move in a rash way within us. Rather, it operates spontaneously and softly." These words show me that God is totally opposite from me; He is soft and gentle; I am rough and tough, thank you Lord for showing me Your divine nature, divine attribute, Lord, infuse this nature, essence into my entire being so that I can be your expression, soft and gentle towards your will, your working, and to all the members in the BODY. Amen.

Brothers, I am not completely clear with "element, essence, substance, attribute, and virtue", can you help me ?

Thank you Lord for this ministry, expand this ministry to the entire inhabited earth. Amen.

	<article author="Hymnal.net" city="" provst="" country="" month="12" day="6" year="2012">When we compiled the hymnal, we did consider this matter of the "rind" and the "flesh." Since a watermelon must have both rind and flesh, we kept the "rind" hymns. However, we must learn to eat the "flesh," because the essence and nutrients are in the flesh. We must not eat only the rind. The saints seldom call hymns on experiencing Christ as life, such as Hymns, #841 and #501, or hymns on Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit, such as #450 in the Chinese hymnal and Hymns, #612. Some may not even know the tune to these hymns. We do not call these hymns, because we lack a vision of the treasure within these hymns. These hymns are on the riches of Christ who, as the all-inclusive Spirit, is in us to be our supply. Regrettably, the brothers and sisters do not know how to appreciate these hymns. They prefer to sing "rind" hymns.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="4" day="8" year="2008">The problem is, by what life will we live? By the first life or the second life? By the natural life or the divine life? By our self or by Christ? I say again that I have not found anyone, even one who is very much in the church life, who lives Christ day by day and hour after hour and does not live himself. Hymns #841, 499, and 501 (Hymns) speak of living Christ and not ourselves. We need to check to see if our life matches the standard expressed in these hymns. We need to realize that we were created to be like God, even to be one with God. Furthermore, we have been saved into God to be regenerated by Him that we may be His children and may be members of Christ to constitute the Body of Christ. However, we need to ask ourselves whether we live God or not. We do have a marvelous provision. God has provided us with a body and with a spirit, which are very sufficient for us to live as a man to worship God, to receive God, and to contain God that we may live God and express Him.

Even after being saved by God, we may not live Him. We may be gentlemen, men who are right, but we may not be able to say, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me" (Gal 2:20a). We may not be able to apply this holy word to ourselves. We need to realize the organic union between us and God. We need to behave ourselves, to walk, to live, to do everything, in this organic union. It should not be I but Christ; it should not be I by myself, but I with God, united, mingled, and blended to be one person, a God-man.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="31" year="2008">However, it is not sufficient to be separated and made holy unto God positionally. After we are sanctified positionally and reconciled to God, as we begin to pursue in life, we will sense something within us which is not our disposition but God's nature. This nature within us deals thoroughly with our natural disposition, our peculiar disposition, and our temperament so that the divine nature becomes our disposition. This is to sanctify the believers dispositionally that they may partake of God's holy nature and be one with God in this attribute of His (Rom. 15:16). This kind of sanctification uses the element of God's life as the material and is carried out through the sanctifying work in the believers by the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2).

This is exactly my experience. After I was saved, because I loved the Lord and was growing in life, God's holy nature continually carried out a sanctifying work in me. When I went to the department stores, I looked at one item, yet I could not wear it; I looked at another item and I could not use it. When I first changed to wearing Western clothes, buying neckties was a big problem. Some neckties were too wide, others were too narrow, and still others were too fancy. Today my neckties are neither too wide nor too narrow nor too fancy. This is because when I go to buy a necktie, there is a nature within me that wants me to buy this kind of necktie. Brothers, the yardstick for our living and our clothing is the divine nature within us. This divine nature of God within us is the yardstick for our living. Stanza 1 of Hymns, #841 says, "Thou art all my life, Lord,/In me Thou dost live;/With Thee all God's fulness/Thou to me dost give./By Thy holy nature/I am sanctified,/By Thy resurrection,/Vict'ry is supplied." By the Lord's holy nature we are sanctified. This kind of sanctification is not outward but inward. Therefore, we do not say that this is positional sanctification; rather, we say that it is dispositional sanctification.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="31" year="2008">The second step of transformation is sanctification, the sanctification of the Holy Spirit (Rom. 6:19, 22; 15:16). After our old man was buried through baptism, God set us apart and sanctified our regenerated new man. This new man belongs to God, and God is in this new man. This sanctification is not only an objective sanctification in position; it is even more a subjective sanctification in disposition. We, as the saved ones, all have this experience. For example, after a person is saved, without anyone telling him, he may feel that the shoes he is wearing are too worldly. When he bought this pair, he liked the pointed style, which is a favorite of the Texan cowboys. But now that he is saved, when he wears these shoes, he feels that there is too much of a worldly flavor, so he cannot wear them. When I went to the United States about thirty years ago, it was the time of the hippies. There were many hippies who came to our meetings, but there was one that I can never forget. He was big in stature, wore a headdress with varied colors, and had a long beard. He came to the meetings barefoot and sat on the front row. Praise the Lord, after two or three meetings his headdress was gone, and after another week his long beard was also gone. I was very happy. Nevertheless, he still came barefoot. After another week he came wearing sandals. This was better than being barefoot. After another period of time he came wearing shoes, and after a little more time he came also wearing socks. He was sanctified. Stanza 1 of Hymns, #841 says, "Thou art all my life, Lord, / In me Thou dost live; / With Thee all God's fullness / Thou to me dost give. / By Thy holy nature / I am sanctified, / By Thy resurrection, / Vict'ry is supplied." The Lord lives in us to be our life, and this life with the divine nature sanctifies us within. This is the second step of transformation.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="31" year="2008">The first stanza of Hymns, #841 says that the Lord is our life, that He lives in us, and that we are sanctified by His holy nature. God the Father has put His life into us that we might be His sons, and He has put His nature into us that we might be made holy as He is. These are the blessings of the Father revealed in Ephesians 1:3-6. Verse 6 concludes this section of the blessings given to us by the Father by saying, "To the praise of the glory of His grace."

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="28" year="2008">God's law of the Spirit of life does not move in a rash way within us. Rather, it operates spontaneously and softly. This can be compared to our eating. Within us is a law of digestion that does the work of digestion in us. A little while after the food gets into us, the digestion is completed, and the food becomes our nutrients. It is true that we are not good, but we should not expect to improve quickly. We have to do what Hymns, #841, stanza 6, says, "I would cease completely from my efforts vain." We should not struggle or strive anymore. Instead, we should simply hand ourselves over to God's law. We have to know that our natural life is also a law. After Satan entered into man, the natural law within man became distorted. Either we do not love the Lord, or we expect that we can be a "saint." However, we should not expect too much. Instead, we should simply allow the grafted life to grow spontaneously according to its own law of life.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="28" year="2008">I know that many working brothers and sisters, after finding a job, experience pressure from their boss, competition from their co-workers, plus the jealousy of the aggressive ones. It is indeed not a simple situation. Not only so, but after marriage they will have a wife, and not long afterwards they will have children. It is indeed troublesome. Although there is enjoyment in these things, yet it is not without troubles. What shall we do? This is just like the hymn we sang tonight, which says,
... [Stanza 1 and 6]

This is just like what the Bible shows us. The divine power of God has granted unto us all things related to life and godliness. The sufficient life supply will meet all our needs. Therefore, we do not have to worry; we need only to draw on God's supply by faith.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="25" year="2008">In this hymn the word "give" actually refers to the divine dispensing. All the fullness of God is given to us in Christ, and this giving is simply the dispensing of all that the Triune God is, has, and does into our being.

This hymn also tells us that we are sanctified by the Lord's holy nature. This sanctification is not so-called sinless perfection; it is the sanctification by the holy nature that has been imparted into our being. The holy nature imparted into us is the holy nature of the Triune God. This imparting of God's holy nature is not once for all; it is a matter that continues day by day and hour by hour. Continually the holy nature of the Triune God is being imparted into us. This impartation causes us to be saturated with the holy essence of the divine Trinity for our sanctification.

This hymn also tells us that by Christ's resurrection victory is supplied to us. In ourselves we cannot overcome anything or be victorious. In ourselves we are sinful and even dead in our spirit. But we have received the resurrected Christ as our life. Now, in His resurrection, He is dispensing Himself into us. Therefore, when we enjoy Him, we also enjoy Him as resurrection life and resurrection power. This resurrection life and power give us subjectively the victory over all negative things. Furthermore, by this life, which is Christ Himself, we live a life according to the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens. This means that we live a life which corresponds to the reality of the kingdom nature. This reality is the content of the church life. If we would live in this reality and express it in the church life, we need to receive the divine dispensing.
