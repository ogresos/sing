Never did You promise us a life without mistakes, trials, heartbreak and sorrow. These things are inevitable. However, Lord, You have given us assurance of strength and endurance. When we are in You, we can find refuge and rest. We know that we can lean on You when life throws us curveballs. Lord, You know what is on our hearts and You know why our tears fall. I just want to learn to trust You, oh Lord, in the midst of these obstacles. Amen.</article>

It saw me through the death of my parents, my younger sister and now I am coping with the loss of a husband. 
I don't know how it got to be in my bedroom those years ago but I thank God for it. Now I know there is a hymn tune for it I shall have it at my funeral - but not yet, Lord, I have more I want to do!</article>

	<article author="Dora Yao" email="" city="New York" provst="NY" country="" month="1" day="11" year="2010">As a Christian, this might be the hardest lesson to learn. Following the narrow path is often accompanied with travail and difficult time. It is very difficult to see them as opportunities to mature spiritually and to grow in faith. Most often, we wobble and question - is there a point to this suffering? or how come? Well..the answer is in this song. God never promised always to have clear blue skies...but HE HAS PROMISED - sufficient grace and strength for the day. Praise the Lord for His promises. Our focus must be on His promises. May the Lord uplift our view...have the view of a bird surpassing the troubles below. May He bring us to higher ground. Ultimately, He is the GREAT I AM! What a full salvation we have in Him.</article>

There she began a book of autographs of which this is one of her favourites. The message sustained her through many of life's trials and joys. It was read at her funeral at age 97 as a guide to live by. I didn't realize that there was a tune to this meaningful poem.</article>

The first time that I heard this hymn the lyrics touches me a lot, even the content of the hymn. Really, He is working within us that we may realized how we need to experienced Him more. He's so gracious to us in so many ways that we can't measure. "Lord, thank You so much for everything. In sorrow or in pain You're always there for me. You made me see how vast is Your care for me. Lord, continue to work Yourself within me. Wherever am I, whatever I do, remind me that You will always be the preeminence." How we need to see Him more and more every moment of our lives.</article>

	<article author="Pshdsa" email="" city="San Marcos" provst="TX" country="United States" month="7" day="9" year="2008">Expectations of the way we believe God is supposed to act, is demonstrated by John the Baptist when he sent two disciples to ascertain if Jesus were really the one. Jesus said, And blessed is he WHOSOEVER shall not be offended in me. Just like John the Baptist, we have certain expectations about the way God is supposed to act. Sometimes we have faith in our expectations and not properly in the Lord. The trial is when God allows those expectations to fail, and as Spurgeon says, God shoots his arrow of seeming abandonment into the heart of the fiery trail of our faith. Has not the  Lord told us to think it not strange the fire that shall purify us to make us just like Jesus? This song is a sweet balm on the way. Habakkuk was shaken by the news from God, but came to that place in his heart where he trusted God no matter if all his expectations failed.</article>

	<article author="Teila Tosado" email="" city="" provst="New York" country="U.S.A." month="1" day="26" year="2005">God ordains the days to be the way they are so we can call upon His name and pray to Him through out the day. Many times I would pray to have a good day, and I would not have much of a good day. Stanza three says "God has not promised smooth roads, and wide - Swift easy travel needing no guide."  Being in middle school I find it more helpful to call upon the Lord's name.</article>
	<article author="Elvis" email="" city="" provst="" country="Barbados" month="6" day="22" year="2004">The song is a refreshing blend of Spirit inspired words and soothing melody.

	<article author="Filip S. Syrek" email="" city="Reading" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="10" day="7" year="2002">Thank You, Lord that in the midst of intermixed and interwoven situations, often when my heart is heavy laden You give me the strength for the day...

This song is so true and so experiential. So often times I forget what the Lord actually promised and drift into a state of expecting the deliverence. NO! God hath not promised to deliver - He promised to give grace and strength for the day! Oh, this is too, too precious! God is with us in our sufferings... How sweet and intimate it is. We know that the momentary lightness of afflictions will work out for us an eternal weight of glory... His grace is sufficient! Even when in the middle of heart-squeezing anguish I doubt - it is so. I take His promises, promises in His Word through faith and not by feeling - this is what makes me a partaker of the divine nature!!! Hallelujah! God has promised strength for the day!!!</article>
	<article author="" email="" city="Toronto" provst="ON" country="Canada" month="1" day="31" year="2002">I really enjoyed this song with some other sisters and I have realized how true God's promise to us is. I experienced just how comforting the Lord can be in our daily trials and hardships. In this song, it relates to how God is not promising us a carefree and easy life without anything to worry about. Instead it tells us all the hard sufferings that we probably will have to go through in our daily living and throughout our entire life. But instead of offering a perfect life, or to keep all problems away from us, God offers what He is and has as Himself. He promises us His grace, strength, light, and help, through all the hardships of life. He is also there to guide us and help us out of our difficulties. No matter how ridiculous or pathetic the situation might be, or how other people might have laughed instead of sympathized, God's sympathy is truly inexhaustible, never running out and He is also offering to us His undying and everlasting love. Through all the difficulties of life, God is there to comfort our trials.

Some of us probably wonder, "Well, if God is the Almighty and He has power over everything in the universe, then why does He make us go through these hardships? Why do we need His grace for our suffering, why can't He just make our life easy, then we won't need Him to comfort and help us?" However, if we think carefully, God uses these opportunities to gain us and show us how real He can be to us. Usually, for most of us, when life seems wonderful and everything is going fine, we shut Him out of our life. Our reasoning is usually, "Hey, my life is going just fine. Why do I need the Lord? Life is complete without Him." When life is like that, we go on with our daily living without experiencing Him or having any contact with Him. Therefore, God creates these situations in which we are so hopeless and have no control over it that we will turn away from the world and to the Lord. And when we turn to Him, HALLELUJAH!, we get such a sweet and personal experience of Him! God's goal is to work Himself into Man. However, because of our stubbornness, and continuously refusing to turn to Him, the Lord has to keep on using these situations to gain us, because it's almost the only time that we will allow Him to speak to us.

If you have been in darkness for a long time, just turn to the Lord in your troubles and He will be there to guide you. Not only that, but we shouldn't only turn to God when we are in trouble, but we should talk to Him every single day! He is willing to listen to you, sympathize and love when you feel low, and He will guide you for the rest of your life if you will simply turn and listen to His voice. You will realize also, how sweet and real He will be to you. Amen.</article>
	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="31" year="2008">As an elderly person, I have passed through a great many different experiences in human life. Many unpleasant things have happened to me. There is no such thing as a life without difficulties. As the line from a hymn says, "God hath not promised skies always blue" (Hymns, #720). But although I have passed through many situations of unhappiness and unpleasantness, I have been a happy person because I have the Lord Jesus. Even the demons can testify that I am happy in the Lord. I do not have the Lord Jesus merely in an objective way as the One in the heavens. My Christ is both in the heavens and also in me. Hallelujah, Christ lives in me, and I can breathe Him, drink of Him, and feast upon Him! Daily I enjoy the best breathing, drinking, and eating.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="27" year="2008">As fallen ones, we may have the fallen natural concept that if we fear God, serve Him, love Him, and follow Him, we will prosper in everything; the unhealthy will become healthy and the foolish will become wise. However, God has not promised this. Hymns, #720 was written by an experienced Christian. Verse 1 and the chorus say,
...
Many times, God has placed those who love Him into trials and sufferings that they may experience more of Him. When everything is calm and peaceful, we seldom think of enjoying God and know very little about experiencing the Lord. Only when we fall into sufferings can we be humbled to trust the Lord wholeheartedly, call on Him, and enjoy Him.
