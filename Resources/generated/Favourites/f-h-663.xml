    <article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="2" day="28" year="2014">Dean of Canterbury, Henry Alford, was born in London. He wrote Latin odes and a history of the Jews before he was 10. At the age of 16 he wrote in his Bible: "I do this day, in the presence of God and my own soul, renew my covenant with God, and solemnly determine henceforth to become His, and to do His work as far as in me lies." Although he prepared a hymn book, which contained 55 of his own hymns, he is mainly known for his monumental commentary, "The Greek New Testament", which took him 20 years to complete. Alford was requested to write "Forward be our watchword", to be used as a processional in Canterbury Cathedral. He composed this song as he marched up and down the aisles. He died before this hymn was sung for the 1st time by the Canterbury choirs. The original has 8 stanzas. - Songs of the Spirt by Martin
-------------------
The 1st 8 lines of the original 1st stanza are the same as hymnal.net, but the last 4 lines differ:
1 Forward! be our watchword, 
steps and voices joined;
Seek the things before us, 
not a look behind;
Burns the fiery pillar 
at our army’s head;
Who shall dream of shrinking, 
by our Captain led?
Forward through the desert, 
through the toil and fight;
Jordan flows before us; 
Zion beams with light.
-----------------------------
2 Forward! When in childhood 
buds the infant mind;
All through youth and manhood 
not a thought behind;
Speed through realms of nature, 
climb the steps of grace;
Faint not, till in glory, 
gleams our Father’s face.
Forward, all the lifetime,
climb from height to height,
Till the head be hoary, 
till the eve be light.
-----------------------------------------------
3 Forward! flock of Jesus, 
salt of all the earth,
Till each yearning purpose 
spring to glorious birth:
Sick, they ask for healing; 
blind, they grope for day;
Pour upon the nations 
wisdom’s loving ray.
Forward, out of error, 
leave behind the night;
Forward through the darkness,
 forward into light!
------------------------------
The original 4th stanza is the hymnal.net 2nd stanza. It is the same except for the 9th and 10th lines:
4 Glories upon glories 
hath our God prepared,
By the souls that love Him 
one day to be shared;
Eye hath not beheld them, 
ear hath never heard;
Nor of these hath uttered 
thought or speech a word;
Forward, marching eastward, 
where the heaven is bright,
Till the veil be lifted, 
till our faith be sight.
----------------------------------------
5 Far o’er yon horizon 
rise the city towers
Where our God abideth; 
that fair home is ours:
Flash the streets with jasper, 
shine the gates with gold;
Flows the gladdening river 
shedding joys untold.
Thither, onward, thither, 
in the Spirit’s might;
Pilgrims to your country, 
forward into light!
----------------------------------
6 Into God’s high temple, 
onward as we press,
Beauty spreads around us, 
born of holiness;
Arch, and vault, and carving, 
lights of varied tone,
Softened words and holy, 
prayer and praise alone.
Every thought upraising 
to our city bright,
Where the tribes assemble 
round the throne of light.
---------------------------
7 Naught that city needeth 
of these aisles of stone;
Where the Godhead dwelleth, 
temple there is none;
All the saints that ever 
in these courts have stood,
Are but babes, and feeding 
on the children’s food.
On through sign and token,
stars amidst the night,
Forward through the darkness,
forward into light.
------------------------------
8 To th’eternal Father 
loudest anthems raise;
To the Son and Spirit
echo songs of praise;
To the Lord of glory,
blessed Three in One,
Be by men and angels 
endless honor done.
Weak are earthly praises, 
dull the songs of night:
Forward into triumph, 
forward into light!</article>
