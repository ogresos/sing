Yes and we are those unrighteous in the eyes of God, but I thank and praise the Lord that, He as the righteous One will make us the many righteous. Oh Lord, I love You with the first and best love. Now I renew my consecration toward You Lord. Lord, I want nothing else but You. Lord keep us with Your loving hand. Oh Lord, gain me thoroughly for Your economy. I love You very, very, very much!!!</article>
