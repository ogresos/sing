I've known this hymn since I was born again in 1955 and it's always a cheerful blessing to my heart.

There's a peace in my heart that the world
  never gave,
A peace it can not take away;
Tho' the trials of life may surround like
  a cloud,
I've a peace that has come there to stay!

Chorus:

Constantly abiding, Jesus is mine;
Consantly abiding, rapture divine;
He never leaves me lonely,
Whispers O so kind: "I will never leave
  thee," 
Jesus is mine.

All the world seemed to sing of a Savior
  and King,
When peace sweetly came to my heart;
Troubles all fled away and my night turned
  to day,
Blessed Jesus, how glorious Thou art!

This treasure I have in a temple of clay,
While here on His footstool I roam; 
But He's coming to take me some glorious
  day,
Over there to my heavenly home!

God bless you all with His presence and His name, Jehovah Shammah, which means the Lord is there." (Ezekiel 48:35)</article>
