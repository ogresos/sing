'all other ground is sinking sand'. 
I was wondering why this lines pops up for me.. 
I believe this line was meant for me to really put my trust in Him as my rock in whatever I do today. Literally it means other than God Himself, all other things and areas are sinking sand awaiting to swallow me.. 
Thank You God.. That reminds me of Psalms 91..He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High Shall abide under the shadow of the almighty......</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="6" day="10" year="2016">Here is more about the author of this hymn in addition to David's post on 4/9/2010, Deb's on 2/1/2012 and mine on 7/20/2012 &amp; 12/30/2014:
As Edward Mote walked up High Holborn to his cabinet shop in London, his mind was filled with thoughts of a dispute about doctrine, which had turned a business meeting at his church into an unpleasant experience for him. One man was insisting on a point of doctrine that Mr. Mote did not feel to be essential to salvation or to spiritual growth in Christ. In answer to this brother, a thought came to his mind. 'On Christ, the Solid Rock, I stand; all other ground is sinking sand.' Other thoughts began to sing themselves in his mind. He reached his shop, told his workmen he was going home, but he did not go home. His thoughts were too pressing. He shut himself in a little office and wrote stanza 1. 
He said later: 'Before the day was over I had 4 verses complete and wrote them off.' On Sunday he attended church as usual. The pastor asked him to pray for his wife, whom he feared was near death. 'Will you go with me to visit her in the hospital this afternoon?' he asked. Mr. Mote went gladly. He was not a talkative man. He did not know how to console a dying woman, particularly the wife of his pastor. He still had this poem in his pocket. He took it out and sang the words to a familiar hymn tune. After each verse he added the words: 'On Christ, the Solid Rock, I stand; All other ground is sinking sand.' A dying soul was comforted. Mr. Mote had 1,000 copies of his poem printed and gave them to friends. The poem was printed in a hymnbook, and it has become a favorite. ...
Mote was 34 years old when he wrote this hymn. Two years later, he decided to enter the Christian ministry. He built a church at his own expense. When his congregation offered to give him a deed to the church and property, he replied, 'All I want is the pulpit. If I ever cease to preach Christ you can turn me out of that.' - Hymn Stories by Wilbur Konkel</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="12" day="30" year="2014">In Matt 7:24-27, on which this hymn is based, to build on the solid rock is to hear Christ's words and DO them. To build on the sand is to hear Christ's words and NOT DO them. 
Matt 7:24 starts with "Therefore", meaning that it explains the previous verses about entering into the kingdom, so I've included them:
Matt 7:21 Not every one that says unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.
 22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?
 23 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.
 24 Therefore whosoever hears these sayings of mine, and does them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:
 25 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.
 26 And every one that hears these sayings of mine, and does them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:
 27 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.
 (Mat 7:21-27 KJV)
-----------------
Here is some more about the hymn author to add to David's post on 4/9/2010, Deb's on 2/1/2012 and mine on 7/20/2012:
Mote was born of very poor, unGodly parents in London., England. At the age of 16, as a cabinet maker's apprentice, he was taken by his master to hear a preacher, through whom Mote received the Lord. He became a well-known cabinet maker, and at the age of 55 he became a minister of a Baptist church in Sussex, England. There he ministered for another 21 years until poor health forced him to step down. He wrote more than 100 hymn texts in his life. This hymn may be his best known. It was first entitled, "The gracious experience of a Christian," but in a later publication in 1863 he put it under the title, "The immutable basis of a sinner's hope." - Songs of the Spirit by Martin</article>

This morning as part of my devotion "Surrender" was the theme. Although it makes sense to surrender my situation to God especially since the situation and relationships I was in were not the best and I was unequally yoked it is not the easiest of things to do. This song should help us realize that while we can point accusing fingers to man all we want, until we reach a point of total surrender and to the truth that ALL other grounds we look to for validation is sinking sand SAVE JESUS CHRIST then disappointment, fear and frustration will be our portion. This world is not home and the JOY of our eternal home should far outweigh any pleasures we can enjoy temporarily here on earth. Feels good to know we are loved and the one who loves is the CREATOR of the world Himself.</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="7" day="20" year="2013">The original 2nd line of the 1st stanza says,
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness.

Here is what the author of this hymn wrote about his writing of it:
One morn­ing it came into my mind as I went to la­bour, to write an hymn on the ‘Gra­cious Ex­per­i­ence of a Christ­ian.’ As I went up Hol­born I had the chor­us,

‘On Christ the solid Rock I stand,
All other ground is sinking sand.’

In the day I had four first vers­es com­plete, and wrote them off. On the Sab­bath fol­low­ing I met bro­ther King as I came out of Lisle Street Meet­ing…who in­formed me that his wife was ve­ry ill, and asked me to call and see her. I had an ear­ly tea, and called af­ter­wards. He said that it was his usu­al custom to sing a hymn, read a por­tion, and en­gage in pray­er, be­fore he went to meet­ing. He looked for his hymn-book but could find it no­where. I said, ‘I have some vers­es in my pock­et; if he liked, we would sing them.’ We did, and his wife en­joyed them so much, that af­ter ser­vice he asked me, as a fa­vour, to leave a co­py of them for his wife. I went home, and by the fire­side com­posed the last two vers­es, wrote the whole off, and took them to sis­ter King…As these vers­es so met the dy­ing wo­man’s case, my at­ten­tion to them was the more ar­rest­ed, and I had a thou­sand print­ed for dis­tr­ibu­tion. I sent one to the Spir­it­u­al Mag­a­zine, with­out my ini­tials, which ap­peared some time af­ter this. Bro­ther Rees, of Crown Street, So­ho, brought out an edi­tion of hymns [1836], and this hymn was in it. Da­vid Den­ham in­tro­duced it [1837] with Rees’ name, and others af­ter…Your in­sert­ing this brief out­line may in fu­ture shield me from the charge of stealth, and be a vin­di­ca­tion of truth­ful­ness in my con­nect­ion with the Church of God.

	<article author="Deb" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="2" day="1" year="2012">The "true story" behind this hymn is something like this: Mr. Mote happened to have begun composing this hymn, just going about his normal day. Soon afterward, that very week, a friend asked Mr. Mote to pay a visit to the friend's wife, who was ailing. His friend requested that they sing a hymn, read scripture, and pray together. But his friend could not find his hymnal. Mr. Mote said that he happened to have some verses written down on some paper in his pocket. After that visit, Mr. Mote decided to finish composing the hymn.
When seeing how the hymn blessed his friend, and the wife in her final hours, Mote decided to send a copy to a magazine publication, but did not sign his submission. In the following few years, there was a bit of confusion over who might be credited with having composed the lyrics. Eventually, after seeing his hymn in another publication, Mr. Mote wrote to The Gospel Herald (requesting they publish "this brief" so that it might "...be a vindication of truthfulness in my connection with the Church of God", and was thereafter credited with its composition.</article>

	<article author="David" email="" city="Beltsville" provst="MD" country="United States" month="4" day="9" year="2010">The writer of the lyrics for this song was an Englishman, Edward Mote, raised by unbelieving, somewhat neglectful parents who ran a pub. According to an account of his early life, he is quoted as having said he did not "know there was a God."

Although receiving the Lord at the age of 18, he entered into the business of cabinet-making, following an apprenticeship. Later, at the age of 55, he became pastor of a Baptist church, serving there for more than 20 years. 

This song (which sometimes features alternate lyrics) should be a great encouragement to us, as we can see what the chorus states: "On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand/All other ground is sinking sand." If we can truly enter into that sentiment, we will realize that we must rely on Christ alone. We will encounter many things in our human life, but whether family, a job, a home, education, human attainments--these things may not fully pass the test. They may be as "sinking sand." Only Christ is the true solid Rock on which we can stand, fellow brothers!</article>

This hymn came to mind that I wanted to include along with the scripture about building your house on sand! Couldn't remember the title so thankfully your web site helped me enormously. For me, having a hope that's alive, enables me not to "give up on God" but to patiently endure knowing that hope in God, does not disappoint.</article>

This is the first song I run to when I hear of the woes of the New York Stock Exchange. People depended on people to be honest but greed has made that thinking seem naive. Trust the Lord with all your heart; lean not on your own understanding. Acknowledge Him in all your ways and He will direct your path. On Christ the solid rock I stand, all other ground is sinking sand....can't find peace in ourselves unless the Christ lives within. Ask Him today, if you haven't already.</article>
	<article author="Paul Pennoyer" email="" city="Minneapolis" provst="Minnesota" country="United States" month="7" day="25" year="2008">It's not just faith that my expectations are built on, but faith in the message of Jesus.  

And in that message are amazing promises, outrageous hopes, and incredible assurances.

But the message is not enough.  Anyone can write a spiritual science fiction version of some utopia, something we all would wish to be true.

However, the message of Jesus is built on the reality of who Jesus really is.  Only God, with infinite resources and influence can finance such outrageous hopes that Jesus encouraged us to believe.  Only God can do what is necessary to underwrite the cost of such startling glory.  

And that is exactly who Jesus is, the Right Hand of God, The Only Begotton of the Father, The Word of the Very God, God with us...

The Father said of Jesus, "This is my Beloved Son, in whom I am very pleased.  Listen to him!

You can count on Him.

My home is built on nothing less.</article>
