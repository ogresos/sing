I am referring to the highly esteemed pair of God, namely Fanny Jane Crosby (1820-1915) and William Howard Doane (1832-1915). Theirs is ethereal or heavenly indeed it is! Their descendants should be humbly pround that their ancestors in the Lord contributed towards helping  Nations of the World, where this hymn and more are  known and sung/played (instrumentally). We Salute them for the legacy they let generations after generations inherit and emulate them!</article>

	<article author="Susan Coleman Missionary" email="mrs_susancoleman@yahoo.ie" city="Lahardane (Village)" provst="County Mayo, Connaught" country="" month="5" day="5" year="2016">Whenever I praise the Lord this song, (which is always), it wells up within my soul like a fountain! I love to sing this song, a true song of praise to our Saviour Jesus Christ! You can feel the Holy Spirit loves this song, and within me rises up in elation to our Lord in praise! I've been singing this song most of my life! But I have found that congregations here where we serve as missionaries are not singing it much, or don't know this song. Most are new babes in Christ choosing to sing only the newer songs. But none compare to this song of true praise. I endeavour to get them singing this song somehow with my Saviour's help!!! Once they have song it, they will want to sing it regularly! Praise the Lord ! Praise the Lord! Let the earth hear His voice! Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord! Let the people rejoice!! Hallelujah to our One and Only God! I'll praise You Jesus for all eternity!</article>

	<article author="David" email="" city="Sydney" provst="NSW" country="Australia" month="3" day="7" year="2016">Such beautiful words!
This hymn has always remained with me since a child. There's something absolutely, completely &amp; deeply embedded onto our hearts that totally allows us to really belt this hymn out in a loud &amp; joyful voice, singing to our Lord with a loving heart &amp; a belly full of praise to our most high &amp; divine Lord. I've never known this hymn ever in my 50yrs of being a Christian, to be sung quietly behind a hymn book or order of service sheet? It's always sung loud with cheerful hearts, even by those in our congregations who usually mime the words, (We all have them...!) The Quiet Achievers I like to call them :D. Best way to start any service anywhere, not only under the Lords roof of a church, but anywhere where two, three or more are gathered in our Almighty Fathers name. I must admit, this is one of my all time favourite hymns. Praise be to the Father the Son &amp; the Holy Spirit AMEN!</article>

	<article author="James Chineke" email="m.aondodoo@yahoo.com" city="" provst="" country="" month="9" day="2" year="2014">Please, present this hymn in its original, unaltered form. It is a great disservice to God and the author Fanny Crosby to "tactically" replace a key word in the song the way it has been done. Line 3 of Stanza 1 should read: "Who yielded His life AN ATONEMENT FOR SIN". NOT this form that reads: "Who yielded His life our redemption to win". Why is the word "sin" now anathema in the body of Christ? Please, do the needful and God bless!.</article>

	<article author="Nelson Ouma" email="mandelaouma@gmail.com" city="Kisumu" provst="Homabay County" country="Kenya" month="2" day="26" year="2014">This hymn reminds me on two crucial plans that God had from the genesis of our earth: creation and redemption. It highlights the reason to why humanity need to praise the LORD:
1. He created us in His own image and likeness
2. He provide our daily needs and His provision satisfy our own desires
3. He send His only Son to die on our behalf: redemption that was planned from the beginning (Genesis 3:15)
The song really inspire my soul to praise the Lord persistently.</article>

	<article author="JB" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="1" day="17" year="2014">I pray verse 2 for my neighbor, who at 77 years of age is looking at 5 years probation for defending an 81 year old woman more vigorously than the law allows.

In his view, he is spending his last years fearing that he will fail to comply completely with all the numerous restrictions -- some of which he has not understood very well, I fear.

He needs to know God's love and mercy and healing of his current depression, and for the enlightenment of the eyes of his heart to see the grace and beauty around him.</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="10" day="17" year="2013">When English hymnwriter Frances Havergal asked someone about Fanny Crosby, she received the reply, "She is a blind lady whose heart can see splendidly in the sunshine of God's love." Crosby herself acknowledged, "Darkness may throw a shadow over my outer vision, but there is no cloud that can keep the sunlight of hope from a trustful soul."
Probably written in 1872, this song was taken to England by Ira Sankey, who led the singing for D. L. Moody's evangelistic campaigns. The hymn became immediately popular in England, but was published in only a few American hymnals until Billy Graham rediscovered the song during his 1952 British crusade. It then became as popular in America as it had been in England. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>

I was so blessed to be raised by a strong loving Christian Family from a baby into my youth &amp; even now in my adult life.
I strayed away &amp; rebelled as a teenager &amp; young adult, but now I'm older, I'm extremely blessed to still be part of that family &amp; now also my new Christian Family where I live. It's 150km from my small family &amp; Mother that raised me, but it's a strong loving, kind &amp; supportive new family through the Church I have found &amp; become a part of recently that also give me hope &amp; help with my belated spiritual growth in the Body of Christ..
This Hymn is one of my all time favorite ones. It means so much more to me now than it ever did back in my youth.
I was a bit forgetful about many of the verses, but I thank Technology for helping me out there.
I just love singing Hymns like this one at any old time of the day or night &amp; it's always so wonderful &amp; handy to have the music &amp; lyrics there for me to sing along to with just a few touches of a smartphone screen. "Dear Jesus, I pray for my brothers &amp; sisters in Countries who don't have access to the technology as I &amp; many like myself do. May they still come to know You through similar means of the written song &amp; also in the form of a Bible or even if it is through word of mouth or a kind deed...? I also thank &amp; praise You Lord Jesus for guiding me back into the fold, even though it was a really horrible tough life threatening journey I had away from you. What a strong powerful message you have brought me through to praise Your name &amp; bear witness to others who seek to know You dear Jesus. Please use my body &amp; voice as a vessel to let others know just how loving You &amp; our Father are. I pray all this in Your blessed name Lord Jesus, AMEN! "For all those who live in Christian suppressed countries". God Bless you all &amp; keep you from harms way... XXXOOO</article>

Evidently, there is so much fulfillment and joy in serving, trusting and obeying Jesus Christ the worthy Lamb of God, whose most precious blood speaks unthinkable amazing blessings the whole of mankind. I had a personal encounter with God in my boyhood days. Since then I have lived a mysterious life of testimonies.

	<article author="Joey Ting" email="" city="Melbourne" provst="VIC" country="Australia" month="6" day="11" year="2008">We were enjoying this hymn and these verses the other day:

Ephesians 3:20-21 But to Him who is able to do SUPERABUNDANTLY ABOVE ALL that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us, to Him be the glory IN THE CHURCH and IN CHRIST JESUS unto all the generations forever and ever. Amen. Praise the Lord! :)</article>
	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="12" day="30" year="2008">Third, we may classify the hymns by the sentiment expressed in the hymns. This is the deepest and most important matter in choosing a hymn. The sentiment of a hymn is the tender feeling of that hymn. The more tender a hymn is, the deeper is its sentiment. Two hymns may have the same subject and be under the same subdivision, but there may be a difference between them in sentiment. For example, Hymns, #39 and #52 are both hymns on the worship of the Father, but they have very different sentiments. Hymns, #39 is a good hymn that is full of excitement. Singing this hymn may make us want to shout. In contrast, Hymns, #52 is a very tender and fine hymn, perhaps the most tender and fine hymn in the section on the worship of the Father. If we study and pray over this hymn, we will sense how deep and tender its feeling is.
