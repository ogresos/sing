I had the refrain off head but have been looking for the complete lyrics since then until Sunday, April 24, 2016.
The hymn ministered to me then and still does.
All conditions bow to the name of Jesus. Php. 2:8-11. Glory to His name.
The Lord with whom there is no unrighteousness shall not forget your labor of love.</article>

I enjoyed this verse today and I picked my hymnal and found this song. (Heb. 12:2) Looking away to Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down on the right hand of the throne of God. Looked to Jesus.</article>

God doesn't act that way; Satan does. It's God's fault? Think again. Next time someone complains mention these verses. As life unfolds we learn to trust in His infinite wisdom. 

He is silently planning for thee in love, for it matters with Him about you.</article>
