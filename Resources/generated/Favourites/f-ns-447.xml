	<article author="Dietrich Fanz" email="dfanz1@gmail.com" city="Athens" provst="GA" country="United States" month="5" day="30" year="2015">I really enjoy the heart of the author of this song. In stanza three the author talks about other attractions, then tells the Lord, "Be faithful, break me free." He realizes that the Lord breaking away the other attractions can "smart." It can hurt. Further down the author says, "As long, Lord, as love conforms me." He is telling the Lord that he is willing to lose what's dear to him, if that's what it takes for the Lord to gain him.
Amen Lord. Give us this same heart.</article>
