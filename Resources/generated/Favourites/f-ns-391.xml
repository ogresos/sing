	<article author="Tom Smith" email="tomsmith774@gmail.com" city="Lake Forest" provst="California (CA)" country="United States" month="12" day="15" year="2014">This song brings us into Paul's sentiment in Phil. 3:8-10 to know Christ, to gain Christ, to have the excellency of the knowledge of Christ, and to grow in Christ. May these words inspire us to pursue Christ together, not just for our personal satisfaction and growth, but so that we can mature to be Christ's counterpart, His bride for eternity. Amen. Lord, do it in us!</article>

	<article author="Ernjay Kim" email="ernjaykim92@gmail.com" city="Iligan City" provst="" country="Philippines" month="3" day="8" year="2013">"Oh how sweet it is just to know my Christ!
Knowing Him’s the goal of my whole life."

The first two lines of this hymn is very meaningful. It shows us that the sweetest thing is just to know our Christ. It even says that knowing Him is the goal of our whole life. I think nothing is more precious than this!

Want to know why?

It's just because..."The more we know Him the more we will fall in love with Him." Our Christ, our lovely Beloved, just want us to love Him, be His faithful lovers, loving only Him. He wants nothing more than this. May we all redeem our time to give ourselves to love our Beloved Lord Jesus Christ by knowing Him in a very intimate, personal, detailed, thorough, and absolute way.

Hallelujah!</article>
