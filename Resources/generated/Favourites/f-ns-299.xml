Lord I Love You! Lord You are so worthy of our love. Because He poured His love into our hearts we can love Him back. We did not have any love to give Him. in fact we had nothing to give Him. But, because His love covers the multitude of sin, and He gave us His love, we can return some of this love to Him who paid the full price for us! JESUS! AMEN!</article>

	<article author="P.C." email="" city="" provst="" country="Canada" month="1" day="20" year="2010">I really appreciate this hymn because it reminds me of how sweet, personal, and intimate the Lord wants our relationship with Him to be. When we are unsatisfied, it is simply because we have lost our first love for the Lord. Praise the Lord that He is continually drawing us to Him, as the most beautiful, most affectionate One!</article>

Sometimes, I'll be so deeply in my spirit I will open my eyes for a moment because I know that I really probably should get going. I look around, and see nothing! Nothing at all! I close my eyes again and keep calling on the Lord; my everything! I am only 11 years old but already in a deep love with Christ. Hallelujah!</article>

My heart melted at this reading and when I heard it I was moved deeply In my Spirit. Now every time I reach my guitar I'm soooo in love with Him. He and I enter our private chamber and He nourishes me so tenderly. I pray all will enjoy the Lord in this hymn and find Him as the truly loving one and fall sooo deeply in Love with Jesus as I have.</article>
