    <article author="Cindy" city="" provst="" country="Canada" month="2" day="24" year="2010">This is a really rich hymn. It's so easy to get tangled up in doctrine and right and wrong, but the Lord just wants His very self flowing and growing is us. May we leave our concepts behind, what we think we know, and just follow the inner feeling. Praise the Lord that He gives us a way; He's not asking us to "behave" or to "be a good Christian"; He just says "abide in Me and I in you" and if we abide in Him and let Him grow in us, we will surely meet the standard of living of the kingdom people He has set before us. May our Lord Jesus be so real to all of us, His children!

Oh, Lord, let our every action,
 Everything we do and say,
Come from Thee alone, experienced
 In a real and inner way.

Hallelujah!</article>
