Cerda" email="teresita.cerda@ph.panasonic.com" city="" provst="Rizal" country="Philippines" month="3" day="1" year="2016">For me, everyday is amazing day because Jesus gives us another day that full of blessings in spite of many problems that we have encountered in our lives, As a believer I know that Jesus is always with me. I trust Him and I believe that He will not forsake me because Jesus loves us. He died on the cross to save our lives (John 3:16).</article>

This is a great song, but can't be used in Worship without the accompaniment.</article>

	<article author="Kerry" email="" city="Gettysburg" provst="PA" country="United States" month="12" day="13" year="2011">I have a Bible app on my phone. Today's verse was this one from Psalms. I don't have a lot of memories from church as a child. But for some reason this song stuck with me my entire life. I am 45 as of now. And I have searched for this song, in this version many times here and there over the years. This was the first time I have found it. This song was what made Psalms one of my favorite books. I'm glad to see you had the music on here to allow me to recognise that this was it since many years have past diluting my memory. Now I hear it crystal clear in my mind again. Thank you.</article>
	<article author="John" email="" city="Pierrefonds" provst="Quebec" country="Canada" month="9" day="18" year="2011">Yesterday was our Sunday School picnic. We were able to hold it in an underpriviledged area where hundreds of families and many hundreds of kids from all over the world live. We had an open mike where the kids could shout out their names and anything that was on their hearts. Little 7 year old Tabitha stepped up to the mike in the midst of the scrum and sang "This is the day the Lord has made". Thank you Tabitha for touching our hearts and reminding us that we can rejoice because "this is the day that the Lord has made..."
Signed,
Those gathered to the name of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</article>
	<article author="Ruthanne DeWolfe" email="" city="Evanston" provst="Illinois" country="United States" month="4" day="29" year="2011">Sometimes my faith waivers, and then I hear this Psalm and, once again, I recover my trust in our loving God. The Psalms give me such comfort in these unloving times. Has it always been this way? Is it the "human condition" to blame the unloved for their unlovedness, their poverty on a poverty of commitment. If God were not with me to succor me in hard times, to let me know that as a whole world of evolving humans we will at the end attain His goal for us, to be "one people" who care about each other as much as we care about ourselves I don't know how I could go on.

With love to all,
Ruthanne</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="2" day="13" year="2010">Psalm 118 is my favorite psalm now. I put the whole psalm to this tune. Here are the 2 verses (vv 22-23) which precede v24, which is verse 1 of this song.

This is the Stone, this is the Stone,
the builders refused, the builders refused.
It’s become Head, it’s become Head
of gentiles and Jews, of gentiles and Jews.
This is the stone the builders refused.
It’s become Head of gentiles and Jews.
This came from the Lord. Wonderful
it is in our eyes.

The verses following v24 (vv 25-27) are:

Hosanna Lord! Make prosperous!
He comes in name of the Lord is bless’d.
We have blessed you from the Lord’s house.
The Lord, He is God and shined light to us.
The sacrifice which is for this feast,
bind it with cords ‘till altar it meets.
Bind it with cords until the horns,
horns of the altar.</article>
