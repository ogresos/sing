	<article author="Anonymous" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="2" day="18" year="2015">Here in Revelation 3, the Lord Jesus considers the word of Isaiah to be referring to Him. He is the Lord of the house of David, and He holds the key to all promises. He is the one resurrected from the dead, who has "the keys of death and of Hades." The grave is not the glory of the believers. Resurrection is the glory of the believers. The gates of Hades cannot prevail against Him. Listen again to the words of the apostle: "And we announce to you the gospel of the promise made to the fathers, that God has fully fulfilled this promise to us their children in raising up Jesus, as it is also written in the second Psalm, 'You are My Son; today I have begotten You.' And as to His having raised Him up from the dead, no longer to return to corruption, He spoke in this way, 'I will give you the holy things of David, the faithful things....Now David, having served his own generation by the counsel of God, did indeed fall asleep and was buried with his fathers and saw corruption; but He whom God has raised did not see corruption" (Acts 13:32-37).
From this we see that the key of David is the key to open the grave. When the Lord Jesus opened the gates of Hades, no one could shut His believers inside. When He shuts the unbelievers in it, no one can open it. When He opens the abyss, countless locusts will fly out to injure men (Rev. 9). When He shuts up the abyss, Satan will be kept there for a thousand years (Rev. 20:2-3). Both powers are equally important, and the Lord Jesus has absolute possession of both. This is why He could say "to the prisoners, Come forth, / To say to those who are in darkness, Show yourselves" (Isa. 49:9). And this is why He could gather together the sinners, "like prisoners gathered in a dungeon; / And will be shut up in prison, / And after many days they will be punished" (Isa. 24:22). The Lord Jesus has absolute power over Hades; He can overcome Satan, the one who holds the authority of death.
As the One who holds the key of David, the Lord Jesus is the Lord of resurrection and the King of the kingdom to the believers. The gates of Hades open and close according to His will and His authority. Although He is not exercising this authority to rule over the world at present, He has already been made "Lord and Christ" by God (Acts 2:36). He revealed His authority in this way to comfort those overcoming believers who have slept, so that they would know that when the time arrives, He will make them share in the first resurrection, a thing in which many ordinary ones will not be able to participate (Phil. 3:11). A little later, He told the living overcoming believers that He would open a door for them also. In a moment we will see this. Although what is covered here has to do with Hades, it has lessons for us also. It seems as though He is not interfering with anything outwardly. To the unbelievers, He keeps His silence and ignores all present confusions and difficulties in the same way that He did on the boat one day when winds and waves beat fiercely against it. However, He has never given up His authority. He holds the key to all administrations, and He alone can open and close. How comforting this is! Many times it seems as if we are shut up by men of flesh. However, although our eyes may perceive things in this way, and although the ones shutting the doors may be acting according to their self will, they are but instruments in the Lord's will. We do not have to open a shut door because what is shut is of the Lord. On the other hand, if the Lord opens a door, we can be at rest knowing that no one can shut what He has opened. The Lord Himself holds the key of David. Hence, believers need not look to the world or to other believers. What a great temptation this is! Nevertheless, He has the key, and what He has is what they lack. Man can work everywhere. Jezebel, the false prophets, and all those who are living in name but dead in reality can do their own works, but the One who is holy and true is the sovereign Lord of all. The more the believers are weak, the more they need Him. They are without power and cannot open the door, but the Lord opens the door for them, and brings them into a broad and unrestricted place. The emphasis here is on the Lord. If it is right with Him, it will be right with everything else.
