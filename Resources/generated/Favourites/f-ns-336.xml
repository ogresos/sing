    <article author="Tom Smith" email="tom@holdingtotruth.com" city="Lake Forest" provst="CA" country="United States" month="3" day="1" year="2014">This short spiritual song from 1 Timothy 3:15-16 speaks forth what the church isâ€”the great mystery of Godliness, the house of the living God, the pillar and the base of the truth. May we sing this Scripture song to make this word our reality. There is some record that part of this song was sung by early believers. May we sing God's Word also!</article>
    <article author="Kaytee Pono" email="kayteepono@gmail.com" city="Birmingham" provst="West Midlands" country="United Kingdom" month="10" day="15" year="2013">Today I was enjoying a portion about church life and how to be a pillar and a pillar producer in the church, in the Life study of Genesis. And now listening to this song just cements what I enjoyed this morning into my spirit. Halelujah! May we all desire to grow and be fully transformed, that the the church may indeed be the base and pillar of the truth. Amen!</article>
