	<article author="Jaspery Goh" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="25" year="2007">This song tells us that we should call on Jesus' name because we need him. Also, that we should just forget all our concepts... we just need to call O LORD JESUS!!! This is one of the songs I just started singing while browsing through here, I like this song a lot and I sing it with other kids in the 6th grade at my age. Amen Saints!</article>
