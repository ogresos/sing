    <article author="Ian Bryce" city="" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="9" day="11" year="2011">We had this hymn and tune in church today and whilst it is an 'oldie' it was new to us - I thought it was really great. Hope we shall have it again. The Lord is working in the Free Church in Scotland.</article>
    <article author="Jennifer" city="" provst="Ohio" country="United States" month="2" day="27" year="2010">This hymn is simply so beautiful. The words become so true as we experience His life, grace, and even more - His eternal, divine, knowledge-surpassing love.
Praise Him for all that He has done. Nothing in the entire universe can snatch us out of His kingdom; the Lord is the One sanctifying us. Let us thank Him for opening our eyes and allowing us to see. Oh, He is the One who is revealing more of Himself to each moment, every day. Praise You, Lord!</article>
