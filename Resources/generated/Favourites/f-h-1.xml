	<article author="Dennis" email="" city="London" provst="" country="" month="4" day="21" year="2014">What an excellent hymn! I hadn't sang this for a while. I was just singing it this morning. The Triune God planned the whole creation with wondrous skill but His great yearning was to have sons. Hallelujah! Creation is great, wondrous, marvellous, yet it's just a means for the Creator to fulfill His real purpose of bringing forth many sons.</article>

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="28" year="2008">Actually, the many sons are in the firstborn Son. In other words, the firstborn Son includes the many sons. It is a corporate Son that is praising and exulting God. This is a profound truth. But it has been written into a hymn and is explained in very simple words. I hope that you can all enter into these truths and can teach them to the new ones.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="24" year="2008">Hymn #1 (Hymns) is very simple and short but deep in its thought concerning God's purpose:
...
According to my knowledge, of all the hymns chosen by us to be included in our hymnal, apart from those written by us, no other hymn covers the New Testament economy of God in such a good way. The first and last verses cover the thought of the Triune God receiving glory. He receives glory because, first, He created the universe, and second, He will gain a group of sons. Verses 2 and 3 trace God's economy from creation to His sons, and verses 3 and 4 show how God unveils His love and affection to His many sons so that they may love Him with His love. Verse 5 shows that Christ in His redemption conquered all of His enemies in order to gain worshippers in the new creation. In summary, this hymn has the following main points: the old creation, God's desire to have a group of sons, His desire being according to His love, and Christ's redemption gaining worshippers in the new creation. What a wonderful hymn this is!
