    <article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="10" day="1" year="2013">As a young woman, Caroline Noel tried to write poems, but she gave it up by the age of 20. Then when she was bedridden with a serious illness at 40, she took up her pen once again. Eventually her poetry was published in a little book called "At the Name of Jesus, and Other Verses for the Sick and Lonely."
You might think the tone of her work would be comforting and devotional, but this hymn is more theological in nature. It focuses attention on Jesus and His power, rather than on sickness and loneliness. Actually, the poem is a beautiful paraphrase of Philippians 2:4-11, an early-church hymn that shows Jesus humbling Himself on earth and being glorified in heaven. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton

Thanks for including the whole hymn. Many hymnals shorten it to 4 stanzas.
The original 1st stanza of this hymn starts with "At" instead of "In".</article>
