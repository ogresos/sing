No other information emerged about who she was and the circumstances around this hymn. Obviously she knew the Lord deeply, and the lack of information about her, itself, speaks volumes about her intimacy with Jesus and her knowledge of the cross. I found no other hymns under her name.</article>

	<article author="Nathan Ofsthun" email="" city="Cambridge" provst="Massachusetts" country="United States" month="10" day="14" year="2012">Brother Leo, "Honeyed lest thou turn thee thence" goes along with the phrase "Gilded thus does sin disarm thee." These idols of the world, these things that distract us from the Lord do so because they are gilded or "honeyed." The honey and the gilding here indicate that underneath is something base, something unpleasant, something grotesque, so there is the need to cover up the satanic nature of idols with something that appears pleasant. But as the hymn progresses, we see that we see something far, far superior. We see the Lord Himself! The beaming of His beauty, the unveiling of His heart is enough to draw and win and fill us completely!</article>

We can't deny the fact that there are still so many idols within us. So what do I/we do with idols? Just 3 points to kill the idols: LOOK (just like Peter's experience), FACE (like Stephen's experience) and HEART (like Mary's experience). How we need to SEE HIM, how we need to HEAR HIM, and how we need to KNOW HIM. So PRAISE GOD, I'm also one among ten thousands CAPTIVATED by the Lord's beauty.</article>
	<article author="hymnal.net" city="" provst="" country="" month="9" day="29" year="2014">The issue of experiencing God's appearing is always consecration. When we meet God, we spontaneously say, "Lord, everything that is mine is for You. I let You live in every situation." We often give messages on consecration. However, our messages cannot produce consecration. Consecration is not produced from our speaking. Consecration is brought forth after a person has met God. We can give people a mental understanding of consecration and teach them the significance of consecration. But no amount of listening to messages can cause a person to consecrate himself. A genuine and meaningful consecration is brought forth only after a person experiences God's appearing. Only "the sight of peerless worth" (Hymns, #437, stanza 3) can cause us to offer ourselves to the Lord.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="28" year="2008">Only the face of tears that Peter saw, only the face of glory into which Stephen looked, and only the heart that wept with Mary can keep us away from the idols, the attractions, of this world. The Bible tells us that Jesus wept with Mary (John 11:35). Have you ever heard that God weeps? Many say that Jesus came to express God, but they mainly refer to the miracles He did, not to the tears that He shed.
