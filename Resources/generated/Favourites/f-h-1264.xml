I took it is the same sense as Paul saying in Philippians that he sought to forget the things that were behind and stretched forth to gain Christ. He would not let even his past good experiences cause him to be self-satisfied. I never the line to mean 1 John 2:7 or 2 John 1:6 should be undermined, let alone denying Christ as the Alpha and Omega. Things "old or religious" that bind simply meant to me not exorcizing our spirit to touch the living Christ.</article>

There are many things that are old that are very good and do bind us. For example 1 John 2:7 &amp; 2 John 1:6 say we need to keep the old commandment. A minister of the word should share treasures both new and old (Matt 13:52). Jesus Christ is both the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end (Rev 3:14; 21:6; 22:13).
We need to keep that which was from the beginning (Matt 19:4, 8; Heb 3:14; 1John 2:24). 
James 1:26-27 tells us to practice pure and undefiled religion before God.</article>
