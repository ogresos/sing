What more can I say? He's everything that I have yet He is more than everything. In this world, I am just nothing...I'm just like a drop of water from the bucket and like a speck of dust blown by the wind-nothing. But in God's eyes, I'm valuable. Only in Him my life is meaningful and in Him my life has hope. Many times I didn't give Him the first place and I strongly testifies that during those time I have no peace and no satisfaction. I'm thankful that He is a speaking God, He is never tired of speaking to us and reminding us of this and that. May nothing take His place in my heart. Amen.

	<article author="Rebecca Berglund" email="" city="Eugene" provst="Oregon" country="United States" month="11" day="19" year="2010">AC from Canada wrote a comment that truly touches the feeling that spontaneously wells in me with this beautiful, heart-recovering hymn. We may be in a personal "Laodicea", wretched and naked and blind, and be numb to the slightest realization of it. What a gracious gift it is to receive that poignant light which causes our sad heart to repent, to turn to the One in whose light-beams we find the grace of His love, tenderly touching the blind eyes and in our new found vision of WHO He really is and who we really are, we might embrace Him as our covering and kiss Him tenderly, washing His feet with our tears.</article>
	<article author="AC" email="" city="" provst="" country="Canada" month="11" day="12" year="2010">This song has helped me through some of the darkest times in my life. There is no problem with the Lord's love toward us. His love is knowledge surpassing. The problem is with our love toward Him. Like the church in Ephesus, losing our first love will result in degradation. Once we realize this, we must repent. Light will bring in more of the abundant supply of life, which will enable us to love our dear Lord Jesus again.</article>

Day by day as we enjoy the Lord, He is showing us His preciousness and that makes us realize how we need to love Him more. Our first love is our best love for the Lord, loving Him above all is the wisest decision we can make in our life. In our service, His love for us and our love for Him motivate us to go on. May we not leave our first love for the Lord, for He deserves the BEST love.</article>

	<article author="Faith Tomes" email="" city="Toronto" provst="ON" country="Canada" month="2" day="16" year="2003">I love this song because, every time I sing it, I'm brought into my spirit. I need to be reminded often that all my life's just to love Him with my whole being!  My work, school, service, relationships...Everything should revolve around my First, Best Love! He's the reason I'm alive. "Forgetting all that I'm outwardly doing/ Forgetting all of my thoughts of improving" and just loving Him is so precious. I just need to give Him the first place, in all things by faith.</article>
