This words reminded me that it is by His beauty and His love that we love Him today. It is not that we wanted to love Him by ourselves. But that, we love Him because we are captivated by His beauty and constrained by His love.</article>
	<article author="Hanan Lo" email="hlo1545@gmail.com" city="Auckland" provst="" country="New Zealand" month="12" day="20" year="2015">How precious it is to have heard Him and seen Him, the fairest of all, the One with divine glory and human beauty. The more we are captivated by His beauty, the more we are fastened to Him. As we gaze on Him &amp; behold Him we are being transformed into precious onyx stones and are being prepared to be the bride, adorned for our Beloved.</article>

	<article author="Elizabeth" email="elizabeth.inrig@gmail.com" city="Redlands" provst="CA" country="United States" month="7" day="8" year="2015">Having just arrived home from 10 days following Paul's steps on his second missionary Journey as he brought the Gospel to Europe (and ultimately to us in the West). Acts 16 and on tells the amazing story. 
I was reminded again of his determination above all things to proclaim nothing but 'Jesus Christ and Him crucified' - in spite of the religious resistance of Jewish tradition or the Gentile philosophies of mythological gods or pagan practices and plethora of dead icons and idols - still present today among the ruins. 
This song that I learned as a little girl, came to mind and stirred my heart to love the Lord Jesus more. He is the One the Apostles lifted high in spite of the corrupt culture around them. 'What have we do to with idols, who have companied with Him?' Luke 24:25-27</article>

	<article author="Brother John" email="" city="Methuen" provst="MA" country="United States" month="2" day="23" year="2012">Matt. 5:8 says, " Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."
This song really touches our heart. Peter, Stephen, and Mary had a pure heart and saw God. May we all deal with our hearts to turn from the seeming beauty of the earthly idols and look into the face of the Lord. Then we too will be fully captured by the One of Peerless Worth!</article>
	<article author="Pelita CVH" email="" city="Evansville,IN" provst="" country="" month="1" day="9" year="2011">Anything that replaces God is an idol. We can't deny the fact that there are still so many idols within us. So what do I/we do with idols? Just 3 points to kill the idols: LOOK (just like Peter's experience), FACE (like Stephen's experience) and HEART (like Mary's experience). How we need to SEE HIM, how we need to HEAR HIM, and how we need to KNOW HIM. So PRAISE GOD, I'm also one among ten thousands CAPTIVATED by the Lord's beauty.</article>
	<article author="Jessie" email="" city="Edmonton" provst="Alberta" country="Canada" month="1" day="8" year="2011">How true it is, that only "that look," "that face," and "that heart" can strip the seeming beauty from the idols of the earth! Yes Lord, mine is a captured heart!</article>

	<article author="Jaspery" email="" city="Riverside" provst="CA" country="United States" month="7" day="20" year="2008">I really love this song, it describes how Mary was the first one that saw the Lord when He resurrected, how Peter loved Him much, about Stephen's love for the Lord. Also how idols can't do anything to satisfy our heart, Christ is the only one who can! Praise the Lord!!!</article>
