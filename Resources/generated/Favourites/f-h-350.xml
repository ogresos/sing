---------------
Frances Brook, daughter of the Rev. James Brook, M.A., of Helme Edge, Meltham, Huddersfield, was born in Bath in 1870. Her interest in missions is deep, and delicate health alone has prevented her from giving her services in the foreign field where two of her sisters are laboring.
Written in April, 1896. "The need of a friend called forth and formulated the unspoken attitude of my soul towards God, 'My goal is God'" (Author's MS.),. - John Julian, Dictionary of Hymnology 1907</article>
	<article author="Rita" email="" city="Kampala" provst="" country="Uganda" month="5" day="23" year="2011">This song never ceases to supply me. the Lord constantly reminds me-my goal is God Himself, not joy nor peace, not even blessing but Himself my God. Lord, may this remain my only goal-God. May I do one thing-press on till You come. Come, Lord Jesus.</article>
	<article author="Paul Ten" email="" city="" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="5" day="8" year="2010">Not many people know who F Brook is but his experience with God in this hymn helps so many people in Christ to climb up another hurdle of life as a Christian. As such we should not despise ourselves but be a pattern to others by living in one spirit with the Lord. I thank the Lord for His faithfulness in encouraging me to enter into His chamber and share His heart desire with others.</article>
	<article author="D. C." email="" city="Cupertino" provst="Ca" country="United States" month="3" day="1" year="2009">It is a hymn I love to sing alone at the end of a long, busy day. It is also good to sing to Him early in the morning. This is one of my top favorite hymns and I have been singing this since high school. Throughout all these years of ups and downs, this hymn has been a constant source of encouragement.</article>
