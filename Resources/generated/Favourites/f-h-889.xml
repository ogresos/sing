I love the old hymns, I wish my church would sing this inspired Godly music. Now I can start learning these beautiful songs.</article>
	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="12" day="30" year="2008">In order to use the hymns, we first must know how to classify them. There are several points regarding the classification of the hymns. First, we may classify hymns by their subject. For instance, some hymns are for the gospel, some are for edification, some are for the praise of the Lord, and some are for the worship of the Father. Second, we may classify hymns not only by subject but also by subdivision. For example, there are many hymns on the praise of the Lord. In the new hymnal we are publishing, there are twenty-nine subdivisions under the subject "Praise of the Lord." These subdivisions cover matters such as the Lord's divinity and humanity, His love and grace, His human life and suffering, His death and resurrection, His glorification and ascension, and His sweetness and beauty. Likewise, there are a number of subdivisions under the main category of "Spiritual Warfare." There are hymns on fighting in the Lord's name, fighting in the Body, and fighting by the blood. Thus, when we come to a prayer meeting to fight the spiritual battle, we should not randomly pick a hymn under the category of "Spiritual Warfare." Instead, we should sense the atmosphere of the meeting and select the hymn that will best suit the atmosphere. If we sense that there is a need for the covering of the blood, we should choose a hymn on fighting by the blood, a hymn that speaks of how the blood covers us, cleanses us, answers all the accusations of the enemy, and speaks before God for us (Hymns, #889).
