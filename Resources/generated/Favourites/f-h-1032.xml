Perhaps, however, and hopefully so, following his conversion he was an "audacious apostle." :-) [Audacious, adjective 1.showing a willingness to take surprisingly bold risks]</article>

Saints and angels joined in concert,
 Sing the praises of the Lamb;
 While the blissful seats of Heaven
 Sweetly echo with His name.
 Hallelujah, hallelujah!
 Sinners here may sing the same.</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="8" day="20" year="2013">London-born Joseph Hart struggled against God for years. When he attended church, he went to find fault. He responded to a sermon by John Wesley by writing a tract, "The Unreasonableness of Religion." He was (in his own words) a "loose backslider, an audacious apostle, and a bold-faced rebel." Then he came under conviction. At times he was afraid to sleep, fearing he would "awake in hell." He went from church to church, but as he said, "everything served only to condemn me."
Finally at the age of 45 he wandered into a Moravian chapel in London and heard words of hope. On returning home he knelt in prayer.
Three years later he became a minister and began writing hymns to touch the hearts of others who had experienced similar spiritual struggles. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>
	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="26" year="2008">In experience, are we full? Many saints would probably say, "We are truly empty; we are not in the least bit full." We need to know that without the fullness, there is no Body. Though we are the church, we do not manifest much of the Body because the fullness has not been manifested in us. Though we have received of this fullness, we do not allow this fullness to be manifested; this fullness cannot be seen in us. Though we partake of this fullness, it is as if we have not received of this fullness; we feel that we are still empty and void. It seems as if we have nothing within us, and we are too poor.

This is not a matter merely of feeling; this is our actual situation. We need to look at our condition. We can say that our services, our prayers, and all our spiritual conditions are in utter destitution and that we are weak and poor. This is similar to Hymns, #1032, which says: "Poor and wretched, / Weak and wounded, sick and sore." This is our condition. Where is the Body? Is the church manifested? Can God's authority and glory be seen? We see poverty and weakness, we see emptiness and weariness, and we see that the saints do not rise up. This means that we suppress and push aside the fullness that is in us. We are people who have the source, the fullness, yet we live as if we do not have this fullness.
