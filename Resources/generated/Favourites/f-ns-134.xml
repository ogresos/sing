Любляча рука Твоя
Хай веде мене, бо я
Лишити мушу згубний шлях,
Та дух мертвить душа моя,
Це виллє на мене гнів Твій.
Тож дай мені вузький шлях Свій,
І хоч цей шлях крізь терен іде,
Та в взаємну він оселю нас веде.

Тож міцною рукою Ти
Мене над землею здійми.
Згори подивлюсь, мені
Дати може що цей світ.
Я побачу марноту з вишини,
Бажанням скажу: прощавай, земним
І дивлюсь лиш на Тебе.</article>
