    <article author="Bridge" country="Marianas" month="2" day="7" year="2007">This song reminds me to be watchful of how I live every moment of each day.  We were chosen by God in ages past and we are assured of our salvation. However, we must not confuse reward with eternal life! Our Lord gives us a word of warning that we must be ready when He comes. Certainly there is "worst punishment" and not "reward" Line#4 says "reward is not eternal life, It's based on how we run the race, It all depends on what we build, It's not a matter, here, or grace" We need to lose our soul life here. Saints, let Christ be worked into our souls now! We will enjoy the reward and avoid the next age discipline!!!!Hallelujah we press on toward God's kingdom!</article>
