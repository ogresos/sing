I just wish that God's people could see each other through the eyes of our Master and Lord, as being all equal in His sight. What a glorious day that would be!
....still be my vision oh Ruler of all!</article>
	<article author="Linda Brown" email="lrecinos@infinitycare.org" city="Long Beach" provst="California" country="United States" month="5" day="25" year="2016">Bamminer, I understand where you are coming from &amp; can appreciate your perspective. I am Mexican-American &amp; love/embrace my heritage as well. This song IS special because of its ethnic tone &amp; authentic old Irish culture embedded into it....to change it in any way would be a death to the Irish essence that this song is based on. The Irish were persecuted beyond belief in history &amp; have now risen to so much, but their language was stolen from them &amp; they were forced to speak an English version of it....these people have suffered! To change such a historic &amp; cultural song would be a tragedy &amp; a shame....just like we would never want to change black cultural songs &amp; "whiten" them up just for white people to "accept" them. We miss the point of cultural acceptance &amp; cultural appreciation if we start altering things just to suit our own tastes.....doesnt that defeat the purpose (God's purpose) of us all being different? I think our duty is to learn, appreciate, &amp; respect cultural differences &amp; thereby we can honor one another :)</article>
	<article author="Bamminer" email="marsmitchell79@gmail.com" city="Louisville" provst="MS" country="United States" month="5" day="6" year="2016">The song could be even more popular than it already is by taking the Irish-old English out for black Americans. Amazingly, it still works, even still rhymes. Even if you did that, I feel white Americans would still love it, because it means the same thing and it sounds the same, too! Europeans could keep the old version, if they liked; still, it would be so exact that it probably wouldn't even matter to them, either. If you changed the naught to nothing, the thou/thy to you/your where appropriate (sometimes the thou would omitted, as thou/thy can be awfully redundant), and art to are. It just comes off as being corny to most black Americans. That simple change puts this incredibly beautiful song in the running for greatest gospel song ever (probably top twenty all time when you consider how relevant the song is to living a Christian lifestyle and how beautiful it is). I know it's a prayer, but it's basically (in song terms) a love song to God with God [and Jesus] being married to a personal relationship with Him! When I first heard/saw it, I thought (even as a black man) that the song had potential to be one the greatest gospel songs of all time; it prompted me to do some research. I found the lyrics and I felt as if the song was incredibly beautiful, but seemed initially as if thrown to together for the sake of rhyming like bad poetry. I read the lyrics and said the song could be better for American audiences with some simple meaningless tweaks. Some black Americans can't get past the corniness and those words "say" that blacks are not included (far more white European people language than black American) and that the words are not American so they must have been thrown together like bad poetry with lack of real relevance and TRUE feeling (it forms opinions that don't seem to be true about this song anyway). Why have such an incredibly beautiful, relevant song tarnished because many--if not most--black Americans are going to look at it as if were rocks or dirt? Everybody should listen to this and understand, but sadly many won't get past those initial psychological barriers. All I'm proposing is that--since it could be done very easily without changing much or any effect--why not make it American for American audiences and Irish for European audiences?</article>

by Mary Byrne, 1905
Be Thou my vision O Lord of my heart
None other is aught but the King of the seven heavens.
Be Thou my meditation by day and night.
May it be thou that I behold even in my sleep.
Be Thou my speech, be Thou my understanding.
Be Thou with me, be I with Thee
Be Thou my Father, be I Thy son.
Mayst Thou be mine, may I be Thine.
Be Thou my battle-shield, be Thou my sword.
Be Thou my dignity, be Thou my delight.
Be Thou my shelter, be Thou my stronghold.
Mayst Thou raise me up to the company of the angels.
Be Thou every good to my body and soul.
Be Thou my kingdom in heaven and on earth.
Be Thou solely chief love of my heart.
Let there be none other, O high King of Heaven.
Till I am able to pass into Thy hands,
My treasure, my Beloved through the greatness of Thy love
Be Thou alone my noble and wondrous estate.
I seek not men nor lifeless wealth.
Be Thou the constant guardian of every possession and every life.
For our corrupt desires are dead at the mere sight of Thee.
Thy love in my soul and in my heart --
Grant this to me, O King of the seven heavens.
O King of the seven heavens grant me this --
Thy love to be in my heart and in my soul.
With the King of all, with Him after victory won by piety,
May I be in the kingdom of heaven O brightness of the Son.
Beloved Father, hear, hear my lamentations.
Timely is the cry of woe of this miserable wretch.
O heart of my heart, whatever befall me,
O Ruler of all, be Thou my vision.</article>
