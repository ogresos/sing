	<article author="Samuel Bibby" email="sbibby@cox.net" city="Phx" provst="Arizona" country="United States" month="11" day="15" year="2015">I am so glad there is a someone like this someone. It seems so hard to stay connected with people. Either they move on in life to a new place or you move on in life to a new place like school or a job. it just seems like they liked you just because you were in their class or you were their co worker ,but when that is done you just get the feeling they really don't care about you anymore. You call them they don't answer because you don't see them a lot. I have experienced this Going from feeling really importamt to feeling like nothing. I'm just like is there anyone who likes me for just who I am and not what I am? Is there some one who will answer me when I call? My answer is Jesus. He doesn't care about what you are. He just wants you to open up to Him because He cares and loves you so much that one can not understand half of His love towards you and others. Just remember this it matters to Him concerning You 1 Peter 5 :7 How can't we love such a one. If you can love the Lord, You can't love anyone. The Lord is always there wherever and whenever because He is the Spirit. You just have to call His Name Acts 2:21 and Romans 10:9</article>

	<article author="A Sister" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="31" year="2010">This is a wonderful hymn. I love it very much. Every line carries life in it. Whenever I'm struck in a very complicated situation especially times when others cannot understand even if you detail them I find it very difficult to go on. But there is this blessed Redeemer reminding this song in me. Sometimes there is no love in me for Him, yet right in my spirit there is this wonderful "someone who can love me When there's no love in me". I JUST FALL IN LOVE WITH HIM AGAIN.</article>

	<article author="William Chua" email="" city="National City" provst="CA" country="United States" month="4" day="13" year="2009">On Lord's Day, 3 saints who came from the Philippines and a couple fromt the church in Longbeach join a Love-feast in Chula Vista. After the lunch they gathered together and sang this song. The couple from Longbeach, gave the background of this song. It was written for the daugther of the composer, who was in her teen. She said, that there was no one in this world that can understand her. With all the question as it was written in the song, the father composed this song and sang it to her and she was touched and shed in tears. The saints in Chula Vista were also touched with the story behind the song. Thank the Lord, the Christ is this Someone who knows all our need. Praise the Lord.</article>
