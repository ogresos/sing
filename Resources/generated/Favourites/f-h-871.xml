	<article author="Clive Salisbury" email="clive.salisbury@gmail.com" city="Auckland" provst="" country="New Zealand" month="5" day="30" year="2016">The Redemption Hymnal changes line three and chorus to "looking unto Jesus, who is gone before" which is okay but the mention and the understanding of the cross of Christ are very significant. Please read what Paul says regarding God's means of salvation. 1 Corinthians 1; 18-24 "The preaching of Christ crucified is the power of God to change all," Thanks.</article>

Praise be to GOD our almighty Father that even though I was denying Him, He knew me well and in the middle of some of the heights of my fallen existence, it was the songs of the Lord I that were on my lips.

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="9" day="8" year="2013">Sabine Baring-Gould wrote 85 books in areas as diverse as religion, travel, folklore, mythology, history, fiction, biography, sermons, and popular theology. He wrote a 15-volume "Lives of the Saints". He edited a quarterly review of ecclesiastical art and literature. But he loved children, and we remember him best for his children's hymns: "Onward Christian Soldiers" and "Now the Day is Over". 
After graduating from Cambridge, Baring-Gould started a church in his tiny 2-floor apartment. Soon, he said, "the congregation filled the room and the stairs and the kitchen. ... The singing had to bump down the stairs, fill the kitchen, and one strain of the tune after another came up irregularly through the chinks of the floor." - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>

Onward Christian soldiers!
 Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus
 Going on before.
Christ, the royal Master,
 Leads against the foe;
Forward into battle,
 See, His banners go!</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="6" day="6" year="2013">This hymn was sung at the fun­er­al of Amer­i­can pre­si­dent Dwight Ei­sen­how­er at the Na­tion­al Ca­thed­ral, Wash­ing­ton, DC, March 1969.

"Whit-Mon­day is a great day for school fes­tiv­als in York­shire. One Whit-Mon­day, thir­ty years ago, it was ar­ranged that our school should join forc­es with that of a neigh­bor­ing vil­lage. I want­ed the child­ren to sing when march­ing from one vil­lage to another, but couldn’t think of any­thing quite suit­a­ble; so I sat up at night, re­solved that I would write some­thing myself. “Onward, Christ­ian Sol­diers” was the re­sult. It was writ­ten in great haste, and I am afraid some of the rhymes are faulty. Cer­tain­ly no­thing has sur­prised me more than its pop­u­lar­i­ty. I don’t re­mem­ber how it got print­ed first, but I know that very soon it found its way into sev­er­al col­lect­ions. I have writ­ten a few other hymns since then, but only two or three have be­come at all well-known." - Sabine Baring-Gould
-------------
The 2nd stanza, 1st line was improved from "at the sign of triumph" to "at the name of Jesus". 
3rd stanza, last 2 lines, originally said, "One in hope and doctrine, one in charity."
4th stanza originally said "'gainst that church" instead of "'gainst the church". I prefer the original in this instance. Same meaning, but more emphatic.</article>

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="26" year="2008">Paul continues, "To walk worthily of the calling with which you were called, with all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, bearing one another in love, being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace" (vv. 1b-3). Whenever we talk about the practice of the church life, we must remember that the first thing needed is to keep the oneness of the Spirit. This requires that we forget about everything else. The third stanza of the traditional hymn "Onward Christian Soldiers" says, "One in hope and doctrine, one in charity." This is not an accurate concept. Christians can never be one in doctrine. If someone has a certain understanding about a particular portion of the Bible, he may hold to that portion without caring for the oneness. Many Christians insist on baptism by sprinkling, some insist on a single immersion, and some insist on three immersions. Some immerse in warm water, others immerse in cold water, and still others baptize in other ways. In this one matter alone there are many opinions. In order to realize the church life we need to forget about doctrine. If we pay attention to doctrine, we may become a "three-immersions" church. Praise the Lord, the Spirit is in you and in me, so we all are one in the Spirit. Therefore, it is better to sing the above line as, "One in faith and Spirit, / One eternally" (Hymns, #871).
