We may not know what's ahead of us, but no matter how miserable and dark the future seems, He is walking with us. It doesn't matter anymore what our path may be. As long as we have Him, everything's okay :) . Many things have passed, time has passed, and people passed us by, but after all these years He is still there, the dearest and nearest to our hearts. How we love You, Lord Jesus. You are so precious to us.</article>

Glory be to God.</article>
	<article author="Elise" email="" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="3" day="3" year="2013">This hymn truly expresses my experience over the last almost 9 years. I had no idea what my life would turn out to be all those years ago. Lord thank You that even though I still don't know my future, you know! Hallelujah saints that we don't need to know and that He kindly veils our eye's, all we must keep our eyes on is this dear priceless, precious Person! "Lord Jesus, I would rather walk in the dark with You than be without You in the light!".</article>

	<article author="SCD" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="10" day="1" year="2012">This morning I was looking for a hymn to sing in church and I started reading all of your comments. It really lifted me up. Thanks for all of you posting on the internet proclaiming and testifying the name of Jesus Christ.</article>
	<article author="RR" email="" city="" provst="New Jersey" country="United States" month="6" day="21" year="2012">I have to say this is by far my favorite hymn. Some of my brethren find it a bit depressing, but I find it uplighting. To know that I am His, my life is in His hands, and that I lack nothing, fear nothing, because He is in control ... complete control.</article>
	<article author="Dengxz" email="" city="Singapore" provst="" country="Singapore" month="3" day="21" year="2012">I am so heartened by this hymn…He knows my everything! There is no need to worry and anxious but to simply trust in His sovereign arrangements. I confess to the Lord that I often exercise my own will. Exactly, I know not what awaits me at this point of time. I'm confused of what the future holds for me but I know all I need to do is just to depend on Him. I pray to Him to always stay in His loving presence and to follow His leading. May He be gracious to us, be the light of heaven that shines in our darkest time. 
Heb. 11:1 "Now faith is the substantiation of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen." It is such a great blessing to live and walk by faith, not by sight!</article>
	<article author="Anonymous" email="" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="3" day="19" year="2010">Philippians 2:11 "And every tongue should openly confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father." (RCV)

As I am going through a tough trial, which has been ordered by the Father's hand, this hymn came to me. I do believe that "the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the coming glory that is to be revealed upon us." The more suffering, the more glory. Confessing Jesus is Lord not only brought salvation to me but as I call, O Lord Jesus, it is still saving me today and brings me to this thought..."He knows, He knows"...for He is in full control. ALL authority has been given to Him in heaven and on earth and under the earth. The coming of the Lord is nearer today than before...let's prepare by simply growing in life to reach maturity to become joint heirs with Christ of God. And our preparing will hasten His return!!!

Philippians 4:5a "...The Lord is near."(RCV)</article>

	<article author="Mae" email="" city="Chicago" provst="Il" country="United States" month="2" day="20" year="2010">We're going through a very difficult time right now. This hymn is comforting in that it reminds us the Lord is with us through everything and even though the situation seems dark, He know, He loves and He cares!</article>
	<article author="Marilu Veale" email="" city="Long Beach" provst="CA" country="United States" month="1" day="19" year="2010">I always wondered what the words "I'd rather walk in the dark with God than go alone in the light" meant. After all, God is light and in Him is no darkness at all. Yet now, I find myself in a situation where there is no clear path that I can see. I have no light from my current knowledge to know how to go forward. And at this point, I don't even want such light of knowledge. I only want my God. I'd rather walk in the dark with God, than go alone in the light; I'd rather walk by faith with Him than go alone by sight.

How precious are the experiences of those who have gone before us and help us by their walking through the dark with the Lord to turn our hearts and our eyes to Him.</article>
	<article author="L.C." email="" city="San Juan" provst="M.M." country="Philippines" month="11" day="16" year="2009">I love this hymn because it tells me how sweet the Lord is. In my every situation or environment, He is holding me in His own right hand and will never never never let me go.

...and sweetly through the silence comes, His loving, "TRUST IN ME!"</article>
	<article author="madelene camacam" email="" city="Santiago City" provst="Isabela" country="Philippines" month="7" day="20" year="2009">This has been my prayer "Lord hold me tight" I know not what awaits me..but one thing I know the Lord is there leading me because He knows...He knows the best for me. This hymn strengthens and encourages me to go on positively in the church life.</article>
	<article author="Bob Carbrey" email="" city="Buffalo" provst="NY" country="United States" month="6" day="4" year="2009">Brothers, Rejoice! Rejoice! What a mercy that Our Lord is so priceless that he would allow us to Walk with Him in the dark, to walk by faith, to know the realm of faith, where He is so real and dear, and day by day, not asking our consent, seeking what is best for us, to allow us the privilege to know something  of His pricelessness.</article>
	<article author="Ralph Varner" email="" city="Selinsgrove" provst="PA" country="United States" month="11" day="18" year="2008">There are songs that reach out and touch our hearts in comfort and assurance. Then there are songs that surround us, hug us, hold us in love that will never let us go. This is indeed one of these songs that blesses us whether we walk in times of sunshine or times of rain. God loves us always and forever.</article>
	<article author="ruby" email="" city="" provst="" country="India" month="9" day="17" year="2008">It is actually tough to learn the lesson of trusting in the Lord. But this is what the Lord desires from us. That is why He never shows us what is ahead of us. Because what we really need is not what is ahead of us but the LORD HIMSELF. As a young person I always want to know my future. But the Lord is so loving to hide it from so that I would trust in HIM. It is a blessing to follow Him wherever HE goes, to walk with HIM in the dark than without HIM even in the brightest light. Let this be our prayer to our Beloved. Lord keep us always by Your side.</article>
	<article author="Sarah Kihuguru" email="" city="Kampala" provst="Kampala" country="Uganda" month="7" day="22" year="2008">Amen! How sweet this walk of faith is. I keep wanting to know what is ahead, but the Lord would only show me one step before me. Really this is all I need to see because I'd rather walk by faith with Him than go alone by sight. Lord, I consecrate myself to You that where You may lead I will follow. Amen!</article>
	<article author="Sarah" email="" city="Auckland" provst="" country="New Zealand" month="8" day="16" year="2007">is song is so sweet. I especially like the lines "And sweetly through the silence comes His loving 'trust in Me'" as well as "He holds me with His own right hand and will not let me go, and lulls my troubled soul to rest In Him who loves me so." What a wonderful saviour and shepherd we have. We can just trust in the Lord, because although we do not know, He knows! and He will give us rest in the night. Praise the Lord!</article>
	<article author="Joseph" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="2" day="10" year="2007">Thank You Lord for loving us and never letting us go.</article>
	<article author="" email="" city="Hamilton" provst="" country="New Zealand" month="1" day="12" year="2004">This hymn set me free today. Sometimes when we consider our future, we can become anxious and confused and at the same time reason with God. We do not know what is best for us. He knows, He always does. All I need to see is one step before me and all I need to hear is His voice...His loving, "Trust in Me!" Lord Jesus I love You.</article>
	<article author="Judith A. Barrett" email="" city="Lancaster" provst="" country="U.K." month="11" day="1" year="2002">I heard this song this past spring, and the Lord touched my heart to memorize it for a friend who has been imprisoned as an innocent man. Not having understanding why the Lord would allow one of His own to experience such a suffering, the words brought such light and comfort, especially verse 3, "Oh, blissful lack of wisdom, 'tis blessed not to know" and verse 4, "I'd rather walk in the dark with God than go alone in the light". Our trust finds its repose in Him.</article>
	<article author="Anna West" email="" city="Irving" provst="TX" country="U.S.A." month="10" day="19" year="2002">Recently I was having a hard day at school and the Lord reminded me of this song:

"I know not what awaits me, God kindly veils my eyes, and o'er each step on my onward way He makes new scenes to rise; And every joy He sends me comes a sweet and glad surprise. ... And every hour in perfect peace, I'll sing 'He knows, He knows'".

It is so sweet that we don't know what lies ahead. He is the best Shepherd and all we need to do is to trust and follow this wonderful One.</article>
