Many times we fail the Lord and we tend to forget that His grace is sufficient to hold and keep us...To His own master, He stands or falls...Our standing is by the Lord! Maybe we are forgetful...but He keeps repeating the promise....Lord Your Grace is sufficient for me!</article>

His grace is sufficient for me! I appreciate this hymn so much. We need our Savior to tell us over and over and over that He NEEDS our weaknesses! Amen for sufficient grace.</article>

I especially like verse 3, "His grace is sufficient for service, it sets us from selfishness free, and sends us to tell to the tried ones, 'His grace is sufficient for thee.'"</article>
