	<article author="Roselyn u.u" email="" city="Lagos" provst="" country="Nigeria" month="9" day="18" year="2015">Last night while half asleep, I kept hearing the first and last line "Christian seek ye not repose, watch and pray". I didn't understand at first but it kept ringing in my ears. And then I was fully awake and paid attention. I realised I was being alerted by the Holy Spirit of God. 
It's been a very long time I heard that song, over 10 years ago. And all of a sudden, hear it was resounding in my ear...</article>

	<article author="Onah Clement" email="aupirionahklem@gmail.com" city="Jos" provst="Plateau" country="Nigeria" month="7" day="10" year="2014">Blessed be the writer of this hymn. Seemingly, gone are the days when hymns were a meaningful part of Christian worship and lives are transformed. These days, we hear more noise in churches which obviously lacks the power to change lives. Please take me back to the times of refreshing when there's no room to slumbering. God bless you.</article>
	<article author="Julius Oyinloye" email="juliusoyinloye@yahoo.co.uk" city="Port Harcourt" provst="Rivers State" country="Nigeria" month="6" day="4" year="2014">This hymn blesses my soul, putting me on guard at all time, knowing that ambushed lie the evil ones. Reminding me of the need to watch and pray. It's a timely warning, an encouraging hymn for every Christian to have and sing.
God Bless you richly.</article>

	<article author="Disciple Samuel Georgewill" email="" city="London" provst="New Cross" country="United Kingdom" month="1" day="3" year="2014">Greetings Hymnal Net,

Blessed happy new year 2014 to you and all listening and learning this vital hymn as in Matthew 26 verse 41. 
At our local resident London CFT Churches in New Cross and Woolwich Cathedral we have been taught this very important hymn by our Spiritual Father, Apostle Alfred Williams. This comes at a time when songs or hymns rather like this are rarely sung enough with full understanding and he [our Father in the Lord, Apostle Williams] has even said, 'Any hymn book without this hymn is not a hymn book'.
I can see and understand fully why.
Please make full words always available plus people or someone singing it.
As even youtube does not have these words which shows, the world don't want us Christians 'to seek not yet repose'.

All glory be to the Lord God Almighty JESUS Christ of Nazareth!

Agape Love;

Disciple Samuel Georgewill

	<article author="Romaine Peters" email="" city="Washington" provst="D.C." country="United States" month="2" day="4" year="2010">I'd like the exact words to Watch and Pray as it is sung on WFSI, Annapolis, station 107.9. Also where can I get the actual music as it sounds on that same station?

You have the best radio station bar none on the airwaves. Please keep it going. It means so much to me all the time.
Thank You!</article>
