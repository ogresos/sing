	<article author="Anon." email="eunicegarcia76@gmail.com" city="" provst="" country="" month="7" day="27" year="2013">O Lord Jesus! I'm re-reading the book "The Experience of Life" by brother Witness Lee.  The 3rd ch. touches the matter of consecration. There are 5 points listed, the first being the BASIS which is that God purchased us... we are not our own; the second is the MOTIVE - God's love; the third is the MEANING, which is to be a sacrifice... having a change in position and usage, separated to God for His purpose and His satisfaction; fourth the PURPOSE is to work for God... in which we must allow God to work first... we must allow Him to work on us first! for if we try to work for Him directly this would be terrible and is in the principle of offering "strange fire" to the Lord as did Nadab and Abihu in the Old Testament; Lastly, the fifth point is the RESULT of our consecration, to abandon our future both earthly and the so-called Christian world.

Lord I give myself to You afresh this new day! Strengthen and supply us with Yourself so that we may meet Your need. Pray for a strong and solid consecration...to be a sacrifice, to remain on the altar to be burned to ashes for Your satisfaction! Have Your own way Lord... We love You! You loved us first! Amen!!!</article>

Lord, walk on the face of this earth again through us. Lord, gain us to such an extent till what's natural eventually dies. Lord, we give ourselves to You again today.
