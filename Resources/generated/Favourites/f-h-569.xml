	<article author="Stuart Churchill" email="scchurchill84@gmail.com" city="Kenai" provst="Alaska" country="United States" month="7" day="5" year="2015">As a very young boy my father pastored a small assembly in Cochrane, Ws. U.S.A. That was sixty-four years ago. Today as I sat in my devotions I remembered sitting in that congregation listening as they sang this grand old hymn. It certainly brought tears to my eyes. I had to google it and sat here singing along with the music. Oh how sweet to simply trust Him!</article>
	<article author="Appiah Agyeman Jnr" email="appiah.agyeman@techmahindra.com" city="Tema New Town" provst="" country="Ghana" month="5" day="26" year="2015">This song first made so much meaning to me when a sister sung it during a leadership seminar organised by the DYO for the young leaders in the church (The Tema
 Diocese of the Methodist Church) on Monday May 25, 2015.
The song has repeatedly been ringing in my mind that I could not help than to wake up at 12:30 midnight to search for the full version.
Indeed, trusting Jesus, that is ALL
I HAVE LEARNT TO TRUST HIM EVERYDAY ....</article>

	<article author="Peter" email="jbandpjc@onetel.com" city="Towcester" provst="Northamptonshire" country="United Kingdom" month="3" day="24" year="2015">I was prompted to search for this hymn after reading the Our Daily Bread devotional, published by Radio Bible Class, of today, 24 March 2015, written by Joe Stowell.

Many times I have faltered.

	<article author="Eunice" email="eunicegarcia76@gmail.com" city="" provst="NY" country="United States" month="4" day="5" year="2014">I'm beginning to understand that the Christian life is a life of suffering. However, within all the trials and testing there is a sure supply of grace. God went through tremendous process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection and He ascended as a man! Now He lives in me, in us! And He desires for us to enjoy Him, to depend on Him, and to know Him...by opening up to Him and letting Him in -saturating every part of our being. I thank the Lord Jesus Christ for all things as we know that all things work together for good. The good here is that we would be conformed to His image! So I declare I'm not here to have a "good" life but to gain Christ! Thank You dear Lord Jesus! We love You Lord!</article>
	<article author="Fanny" email="" city="Accra" provst="" country="Ghana" month="11" day="23" year="2013">This song first came through to me at a friend's funeral where her dad sang it as part of his tribute to her.

	<article author="Esther" email="" city="Atlanta" provst="Georgia" country="United States" month="11" day="6" year="2013">One of my favorite. I learnt it way back in school (Wesley Girls' high school, Ghana m) from the Methodist hymn book. I've grown to understand and appreciate the words more. I think, every Christian should know this song. The words are simply awesome. Simply trusting God, everyday!</article>
	<article author="Elvis Nonome" email="payforall2007@gmail.com" city="Accra" provst="Tesano" country="Ghana" month="4" day="22" year="2013">This is a marvelous hymn. In fact, it is one of my favourite hymns. As the three Hebrew young men Shadrack, Meshack and Abednego said to the king Nebuchadnezzar that the Lord is able to deliver them inspite the the challenge they were going through, they were simply reaffirming their trust in the Lord in Daniel 3:1-23. Let us also simply trust in the Lord, whatever befall. May the He that is able to save and bring victory, guide us all as we continue trusting Him even when we go through the valley of death. I also thank those who thought of a site like this and are operating it. God bless you.</article>
	<article author="Stella" email="axellestella@gmail.com" city="Frankfurt" provst="Hesse" country="Germany" month="3" day="8" year="2013">Trusting the Lord everyday is just the best thing to do in whatever situation. The Lord is faithful and trusting Him just brings peace to the body and soul. Praise be to the Lord through His Son Jesus Christ! Keep the faith up my brothers and sisters. It shall be well with us. :)</article>
	<article author="Richard Sedafor" email="" city="Aberdeen" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="11" day="19" year="2012">Jesus is true, Jesus answers prayers! Jesus is faithful. Just Simply trust Him. In July, the road to the future was dark. The only light I held unto was the word of the Lord Assuring me that "...see, I have set before you an open door which No Man can shut..." Rev. 3:8.
Here I am in November, celebrating God's goodness in Jesus name. All I wanted come to pass. All He promised He gave. And indeed, I had more than I wanted. Yes, it was tough, but that made it a miracle because I saw the power of God making a way where there was simply no way. I testify of His goodness today and say to anyone who is going through tough times, Simply trust Jesus.</article>
	<article author="Vivipeter" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="10" day="31" year="2012">A sister once told me: if you're depressed, be depressed. A brother recently told me: if you're anxious, then be anxious. but the solution is: do not undergo it alone. Is He in your boat in this storm?

It is very normal to have to go through these feelings, this is the storm you must go through because the Lord ordained it. The Lord never promised skies always blue, in fact He never promised much because the road with the Lord is full of storms, however, it is worth it. He only gives enough for you to handle. We walk not by the outward circumstance but by faith, by the spirit. Don't let the enemy -- the demons in the wind and the water -- to wear you out! Look at Him. Be still with Him. HOWEVER SMALL OUR FAITH, He is the calm within the storm.</article>
	<article author="Richard Sedafor" email="" city="Accra" provst="" country="Ghana" month="7" day="11" year="2012">I am believing God for a breakthrough that will change the course of my life for good. I have previously had an assurance in the Words of Jesus in Rev. 3:8 "See, I have set before you an open door, and no one can shut it." So here I am simply trusting Jesus through the process for He is faithful.</article>
	<article author="Evelyn" email="" city="Accra" provst="" country="Ghana" month="5" day="17" year="2012">As I sat behind my computer and thought of some proceedings in the court room God gave me an assurance in this song: 'Simply trusting every day'. I googled it and here I am with many many testimonies of how God came through for some people through this song. Indeed God will come through for us if only we will trust. As little as our faith is let us simply trust. To you all who are in this with me I say simply trust. Trusting Jesus that is all.</article>

Our unemployment has just run out and there is no sign of work out there. Mortgage is behind and bills are looming...six children to care for ages 4 to 16.

	<article author="MacDonald Chaava" email="" city="Alexandria" provst="Virginia" country="United States" month="3" day="17" year="2010">Words in this song remind me about strength in the presence of the Lord. Friday next week I become unemployed. So much hangs on my employment it is hard to imagine life after that. This song came fresh to my heart during our Sunday morning service. we sang "trusting till the danger be past." Humanly speaking I don't see how but I serve a faithful God who will come through. I stay in the places where I can hear His voice and I know He will yet come through.</article>

	<article author="Rivkah" email="" city="Seattle" provst="" country="" month="11" day="9" year="2009">It was great to read all the other comments, a real encouragement. Today I was reading Mark 4 about Jesus calming the storm, I asked myself the same question He asked the disciples, "Why are you afraid? How can you have no faith?"
Our circumstances constantly change, I realized that my lack of faith= an unbelieving heart towards the Lord, and His person and promises. I love it in this song how it says, even if your faith is small, that is enough. Just trusting Jesus.
I was actually thinking of this song last night out of the blue, I had heard it in college a few months ago but had forgotten it, I started crying as I sang it. I surely needed to hear it. Okay, better cut this short! Grace to my brethren out there! :)</article>

	<article author="JERRYLOU SALZMANN" email="" city="Yakima" provst="Wa" country="United States" month="12" day="6" year="2008">How I love this song. I do not like the situations that have taught me to trust the Lord, and are teaching me still, but it has taken each one to work trust into my being. I find that truly I do sing, pray, and call daily, and when it seems that there is never again to be the light of day, BRIGHTLY DOES HIS SPIRIT SHINE, yet again, INTO THIS HEART OF MINE. PRAISE THE LORD.</article>
