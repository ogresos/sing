His window overlooked the cemetery. There were sometimes as many as 30 burials in a single day. It seemed that every home in the town was mourning for a stricken family member. It was a difficult time to be a pastor. How did he get through it?
"There seemed to me nothing more sweet, delightful, and agreeable," Nicolai wrote, "than the contemplation of the noble sublime doctrine of Eternal Life obtained through the Blood of Christ. This I allowed to dwell in my heart day and night." - Great Songs of Faith by Brown and Norton</article>
