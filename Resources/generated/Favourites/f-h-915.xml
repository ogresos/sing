    <article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="7" day="6" year="2013">In 1819 a royal letter was sent to all parishes of the Church of England authorizing a collection to be taken to aid "The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Lands." Reginald Heber's father-in-law had asked him to preach at his Sunday evening service. When the royal letter came, Heber was also asked to write a hymn that would be appropriate for the special collection. Heber went into a corner of the room for 20 minutes and then returned to show 3 stanzas to his father-in-law. Heber then insisted on writing a 4th stanza to give a more triumphant ending to the hymn.
When he wrote the hymn, Heber didn't know that India did not have coral strands, nor did he realize he would soon be appointed bishop of Calcutta, India, where he would later die. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>
    <article author="Frank Pytel" email="" city="Chicago" provst="Illinois" country="United States" month="6" day="23" year="2010">The writer of this hymn echoes the command of the resurrected Christ to "go to all the world, to all the nations." In a similar way, I have lately desired that the kingdom of the Father would come to all the earth from heaven. I used a book, sort of an atlas, that lists all the countries on earth. I pray five to ten minutes daily for each place around the globe that the kingdom would be there. Although I cannot go there physically, I can go to the Father and ask His kingdom would come to these places. One other thing that can be done, is to replace all the places from pole to pole in this hymn, with different street names in our neighborhoods. Pray street by street, then go and pass out tracts! Go with the One we know!</article>
