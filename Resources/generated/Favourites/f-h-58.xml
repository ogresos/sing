John 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The Word is not separate from God. It is not that the Word is the Word and God is God, and that they are thus separate from each other. Rather, the two are one; hence, the next clause says that the Word was God. Here, we have a very clear indication of His divinity. Oh, praise the Lord for the Son of Man, who is both divinity and humanity, and is the center for the communication between heaven and earth and for the union of God and man in eternity.</article>
