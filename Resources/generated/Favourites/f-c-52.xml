I was a new Christian and loved this song. It has brought me much comfort. This morning the Lord sang it over me (Zephaniah 3:17). I had to find it again and meditate on it. I will be singing it all day long today. Thank You, Jesus, for this precious sweet song!</article>

I remember the lyrics from my childhood, and wanted to bring it to my Sunday School class where we are studying Genesis. 
Genesis 3:8 "And they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day.... "Of course this song is about our relationship after we have confessed our sins and saved by His Grace. To me it's a picture of what heaven will be like. Thank you.</article>

I was working in the yard and this melody came to me. My daughter and I sing together and we are going to sing it for our church services. I do not think of it as a children's song at all. It is a wonderful thought. I like the additonal verses I have found also. It makes it like a full length song. Thanks for letting me find it here.

	<article author="Linda C Gorby (Johnson)" email="" city="Temple City" provst="CA" country="United States" month="1" day="10" year="2011">What a wonderful site tonight as I see my Uncle Orien G Johnson's song is still being a blessing all over the world. He wrote it in 1956. The additional verses are NOT part of the original song. Thank you for your prayers for the family as Uncle Orien, my dad's oldest brother, just went to be with the Lord yesterday, January 9th, on the same day my father, his brother, Claude, passed 27 years ago to the day. I'm thankful that God is our Shepherd and we are His sheep. I cherish my many fun memories of him singing this with me. I love you Uncle Orien. You were and are such a blessing. He worked many years in Christian service and did this while working for Young Life in it's early founding years.</article>
