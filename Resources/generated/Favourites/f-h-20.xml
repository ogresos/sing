    <article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="1" day="28" year="2009">The proof of God's justification is the resurrected Christ (4:22-25). I like the hymn which says,

Father God, Thou hast accepted
Jesus as our Substitute;
Judged the Just One for the unjust,
Couldst Thou change Thy attitude?
As a proof of perfect justice,
At Thine own right hand He sits;
He, as Thy full satisfaction,
Righteously Thy need befits.

Thus, the resurrected Christ who sits at the right hand of God is the evidence that we have been justified. The redeeming death of Christ as the ground for God to justify us has been fully accepted by God, and Christ has been resurrected from the dead as a proof of this. This is the proof of the justification God has given us.

The death of Christ has fully fulfilled and satisfied God's righteous requirements, so that we are justified by God through His death (3:24). His resurrection is a proof that God is satisfied with His death for us and that we are justified by God because of His death and in Him, the resurrected One, we are accepted before God. Not only so, but, as the resurrected One, He is also in us to live for us a life that can be justified by God and is always acceptable to God. Therefore, Romans 4:25 says that He was raised because of our justification.

Christ's ascension to the Father in heaven after He was resurrected is also a proof of our justification, even as the third stanza of Hymns, #20 says:

Father God, Thou hast accepted
Jesus as our Substitute;
Judged the Just One for the unjust,
Couldst Thou change Thy attitude?
As a proof of perfect justice,
At Thine own right hand He sits;
He, as Thy full satisfaction,
Righteously Thy need befits.

Christ's resurrection, ascension, and being seated at the right hand of God are a proof of our justification by God, confirming that God has justified us because of Christ's death, which satisfied God's righteous requirements.
