	<article author="Jean" email="janemontinola@yahoo.com" city="Canberra" provst="ACT" country="Australia" month="5" day="21" year="2016">When I decided to stay in Australia, many trials have come my way. I shed so much tears..the agony of being so alone and so lonely stroked me. For months I was on counselling. My grief was beyond compare, but I never complain. I cry, I pray, I talk to God about my desires, and many times He has answered my prayers. Now I worry less. I know that everything under the sun is in His control. Why should I worry? God made me closer to Him. His name I always call. Today I attended church and this song came out. My tears just keep on falling. God is good And His love is everlasting. I love You my Lord.</article>

This song was and is such a blessing and encouraged my heart! Will keep it near and commit it to memory. Next to Scripture Itself, nothing is sweeter for the saints than solid and biblically accurate hymns. This song was written 100 years ago and we find much encouragement in it.</article>

I was stranded in a strange country, without money or accommodation. I sat by the pool in Sandton of Johannesburg and wrote this song in my book. Then asked God what did the writer of this song mean God? Alleluia! God keeps His word. He provided in ways unimaginable.</article>

	<article author="Sis LC" email="" city="Auckland" provst="" country="New Zealand" month="2" day="23" year="2011">Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go! How encouraging to know that in Jesus we can say "Lord, anywhere!". He may lead us to a way that is hard to follow, but there is no safer way than a way in which He leads. "He may lead us over dreary way", but we know that this dreary way is a way that ends in ceaseless praise. There is no mistake when we follow the Lord. Saints, we can have the confidence in Christ to say "Lord, anywhere!" This song is deep. It's been through death and has risen out in resurrection! Let's experience Him in this way!</article>
