In 1825, while he was secretary, he came in contact with Anthony Norris Groves who had a financially rewarding dental practice. Groves considered 2 ways of offering himself - either his money or his time. Bickersteth responded to him, "If you are called of the Lord to the work, money cannot be set against it; it is men whom the Lord sends and He stands in need of men more than money." (Groves, "Memoir, p. 28). A few years later, Groves sailed for Baghdad as a missionary and stayed there for 3 years. He then labored in India for another 19 years. Groves was influential among the Brethren and was the brother-in-law of George Mueller.
"Bickersteth's Christian Psalmody" (1833) comprised over 700 hymns , to which he subsequently added another 200. "Christian Psalmody" went through 59 editions in 7 years. Some have attributed this hymn to Horatius Bonar. - Songs of the Spirit by Martin</article>
