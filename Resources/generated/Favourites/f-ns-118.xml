	<article author="William Jeng" email="willjeng@gmail.com" city="Irvine" provst="CA" country="United States" month="12" day="3" year="2014">Today during the Bible study I really enjoyed that we need to give Him our first love daily! Lord Jesus, I still love You. Save me from my own "working" for You; instead, I want to "labor" in You and with You! Labor is doing things for The Lord out of love! If we love The Lord Jesus, we won't have to try to do things for Him out of duty. We will love Him so much we will just labor for Him out of love!</article>

But now we turn our heart back—how it sings! We repent of loving other things—Jesus, Lord, You’re our first, best, and everlasting love! Fill us with Your sweet, eternal rest! Lord Jesus we love you!

P.S. Never lose your first love ♡ (Romans 2:1-7)</article>

Nothing can replace Him! We love Him even more each day! We can't compare Him to any other thing here on earth for He is so Great as our very God who is everything to us and our all and in all! Hallelujah! To love and enjoy Him fully is such the bountiful ways to feel His fragrance and preciousness! Let us boldly declare, "Lord Jesus, we love You and we are Yours alone! Constrain us more with Your love! Cause us to be the loving seekers of Yours today and forever!" Amen.

Praise the Lord! :)</article>

It is only the Lord that our hearts love the best. It's the Lord's person that has attracted us, not what He gives and does to us...May the Lord reveal more of Himself that our hearts would repent on loving things less than Him. Oh, Lord, You're our first love!</article>
