	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="Michigan" country="United States" month="6" day="25" year="2016">The conductor, T. P. Ratcliffe, was asked to conduct at Wembley Stadium in intervals during a football (soccer) game. He thought it would be interesting to try having the great audience sing together. Some had trepidations. However, he first suggested "Pack Up Your Troubles," which was sung with enthusiasm. Then, on a venture, he suggested that the crowd of almost 100,000 rise and sing "Abide with Me." King George V was there and rose and bared his head. The great crowd seemed transformed as they sang this hymn so well known to many of them. For one man it meant a miracle. Here is how it happened:
A man from the North of England had gone down to the game. He had been drinking heavily, as was his custom. He went to a football game to get drunk rather than to see the game. When the hymn was announced, he stood with the others, though with difficulty. He said that the first verse brought back memories of his Christian parents. Then something snapped. He could not explain it differently. The verse that begins:
I need Thy presence every passing hour.
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power?
seemed like a prayer suited to his need. He said that he bowed his head, and tried to be reverent as he had at his mother's knee, as a lad saying his prayers.
Bill's wife could not stand going to football games with him; he was such a "boozer." She was expecting his return home, thinking that he would be in his usual state. When he turned the corner, he was singing and running. He entered the house and kissed her, and between sobs told her he was a new man. However, he did not himself realize that he had been converted. Never did he take another drink. Truly, God works in mysterious ways. Who would have thought that a hymn sung at a football game between 2 exciting halves would have resulted in the conversion and radical change of a man who was stoned drunk at the time? The hymn has been sung at Wembly as a regular feature since that time.
The author of this hymn, Henry Lyte, was born in Kelso, Scotland. He attended Trinity College in Dublin, a protestant university. He was ordained in the Church of England. As a young curate (assistant to a parish priest) he was called to the bedside of an elderly saint of the church who was dying. He gripped the young curate's hand, and prayed, "Oh, Lord, abide with me; abide with me!" In prayer, he slipped away to abide with Him forever. The young curate never forgot the incident.
In 1823 he was appointed perpetual curate at Lower Brixham in Devonshire. On one occasion, in company with Rev. Edward Frenkiel, I sat on the stone ledge overlooking the bay, where Henry F. Lyte was said to have sat and watched the setting sun. Thinking of his own life, which seemed to be ebbing to a close, he thought back to his experience as a young curate in Dublin. Soon, too soon, he would have to leave his wife and loved ones. He wrote this hymn that evening, and read it to his wife and guests. They wept. They knew he was ill; little did they realize at the time how fast the "eventide" was falling for him, their beloved curate.
Doctors suggested that he go to a dry, warm climate to preserve his life. He went to the French Riviera, where he passed away 6 months later. Ne died at Nice, France, November 20, 1847. 
Times change, people and governments deteriorate and become demoralized and decayed, but the Savior, who does not change, is there where you are, when you need Him most, to abide with you. - Hymn Stories by Wilbur Konkel</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="11" day="27" year="2014">Of Lyte's hymns, "Abide With Me" is the best known. According to the traditional story given in the "Remains", Lyte wrote it a few hours after conducting the final service at his church, which was probably 5 September 1847. More likely the hymn was actually written in July or August of that year. Lyte himself created for the hymn what his biographer has disparaged as "a dull tune." When "Hymns Ancient and Modern" was published in 1861, the editor, William H. Monk—whose three-year-old daughter had just died—composed his own tune, "Eventide," for Lyte's poem. The hymn became a favorite of Kings George V and George VI and was sung at the former's funeral. The hymn also inspired Field Marshal Herbert Kitchener and General Charles "Chinese" Gordon, and it was said to have been on the lips of Edith Cavell as she faced a German firing squad. "Abide with Me" has been sung at the Football Association Cup finals since 1927 when the association secretary substituted the hymn for the playing of "Alexander's Ragtime Band." In Rugby League, the hymn has been sung before the Challenge Cup final since 1929, the first year the match was staged at Wembley Stadium. The hymn is the also the Portora Royal School (where Lyte went to school as a boy) victory song and is sung its remembrance service.
Leon Litvack has written in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography that although Lyte's "poetic energies were directed at scripturally and evangelically minded audiences, his lyric gift was universally appreciated. The example of ‘Abide with me’ is instructive: intensely personal and contemplative, yet nationally popular—even being sung (always, after its publication in 1861, to W. H. Monk's tune, ‘Eventide’) on secular occasions such as at football matches, and especially, since 1927, at the English cup final." The 20th-century hymnologist Erik Routley referred to the "much-loved H. R. Lyte" who "though scriptural and evangelical in his emphases, always writes good literature and is rarely deserted by an exquisite lyric gift. Perhaps the centrally 'romantic' hymn of all hymns is the intensely personal yet, as it has proved, wholly universal hymn, 'Abide with me.' - Wikipedia

As others have pointed out, this hymn was sung by Emeli Sande at the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony in London.</article>

Henry Lyte coined the phrase, "It is better to wear out than to rust out." And Henry Lyte wore out when he was 54 years old, an obscure pastor who labored for 23 years in a poor church in a fishing village in Devonshire, England. This hymn written shortly before his death, was inspired by the words of the 2 disciples met by Jesus on the road to Emmaus: "Stay the night with us, since it is getting late." (Luke 24:29)

As Lyte wrote this hymn, he knew he was dying of tuberculosis and asthma (see 5th stanza). It was "eventide" for him, darkness was deepening, and he felt very much alone. - Great Songs of faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>

I took a photograph of it.

There are three more verses to the original hymn, as follows:

Not a brief glance I beg, a passing word,
But as Thou dwellest with Thy disciples Lord,
Familiar, condescending, patient, free,
Come not to sojourn, but abide with me.

Thou on my head in early youth did smile,
And though rebellious and perverse meanwhile,
Thou hast not left me, oft as I left Thee,
On to the close, O Lord, abide with me.

Hold then Thy cross before my closing eyes,
Speak through the gloom, and point me to the skies,
Heaven's morning breaks and earth's vain shadows flee!
In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me!

	<article author="Hymnal.net" city="" provst="" country="" month="5" day="9" year="2014">The fourth step in escaping the fall is to know the frailty of man. Enosh is another interesting name in Genesis 4. Enosh means "frail, mortal man." This implies that to escape from walking on the path of the fall, we need to know the frailty of man. We need to know that man is nothing and can break, just as a glass cup breaks easily. This is frailty. Man is frail. Some people do not know themselves. They think that they are smart, wise, and strong, when in fact they have nothing of which to boast. When a car hits a man, he is as fragile as a glass cup. When he is infected with tuberculosis, he must lie down. He may even die from tuberculosis. Man's life is frail. Man's name is Abel, but man's name is also Enosh. Abel means that man is vain, but Enosh means that man is frail. People who dream about their life should wake up. Man is not strong. Man will collapse when he is sick, and he will die if a car hits him. A wife can collapse when she is mad at her husband. She can even get ulcers because of her anger. A person can live to be one hundred years at most. The Chinese say that few can live to the age of seventy. Being fifty years old is not yet the twilight hour, but it is already four o'clock in the afternoon. Some people are at eight or nine o'clock in the evening. There is a hymn that says, "Swift to its close ebbs our life's little day" (Hymns, #370, stanza 2). People must wake up from their dreams, because human life is vain and frail. In order to escape the fall, we must realize the meaning of human life. Those who continue in the fall do not know their own human life. In chapter 4 those who were delivered out of the fall knew that human life is vain and frail.
