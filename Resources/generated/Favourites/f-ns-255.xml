    <article author="ViviPeter" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="4" day="9" year="2014">I remember this song was introduced to my Espinosa's home meeting through trainees Bobby and Justin when I was only a year into the church life (2011!?). Odd to see this added just now! The song can be split in half and sung at the same time; very harmonious and uplifting when we did this. I'll always remember. . . :-)</article>
