	<article author="Lorrain Burnett" email="lorrain1053@gmail.com" city="Brooklyn" provst="New York" country="United States" month="1" day="29" year="2016">This hymn has so much meaning to me. It was sung in our home growing up. My mother's favorite hymn and became the family's favorite. It was sung at my sister's funeral who died exactly 7 months ago today. I woke up this morning singing this hymn not even realizing it was the seven month anniversary of her death until I started writing the comment. This song is so comforting. Let us bask in the blessings of the Lord.</article>

	<article author="Anestasie Danie-Dupre" email="" city="La Porte" provst="TX" country="United States" month="7" day="24" year="2012">As a child growing up in the Caribbean Islands my churh choir sang this song so beautifully. The tune was so soothing even though I did not understand the meaning of the lyrics. I woke up one morning and the Lord just laid this song on my heart. As I listened to it over and over again it brought tears of joy to my heart knowing that the Lord was our Shepherd then and is still our Shepherd now, and His voice has never changed.</article>

 "And bask in the smiles of His face."

The Merriam-Webster's definition for "Bask" is "to lie or relax in a pleasant warmth or atmosphere, to take pleasure or derive enjoyment." 
O Our Lord Jesus is our pleasant warmth and our pleasant atmosphere, we take pleasure in the smiles of His face, we derive enjoyment from this Most Precious Person!

Other synonyms are rest, kick back, loll, lounge, relax, repose.</article>
	<article author="Annie" email="" city="Miami" provst="Florida" country="United States" month="5" day="8" year="2011">I've been going through lately; and all I could remember was the very first stanza. I learned over 50 years ago as a youth choir member and a very active child in the church. It speaks peace to my soul and spirit. I love all the old hymns; they are soothing. Some may say we need something different; but, I tend not to agree.</article>
	<article author="Arthur Brodie" email="" city="Sterling" provst="MA" country="United States" month="11" day="27" year="2009">This is one of my all time favorites. There are other stanzas to this song equally beautiful and rich in the love of Christ.
1) His voice, as the sound of the dulcimer sweet
Is heard through the shadows of death;
The cedars of Lebanon bow at His feet,
The air is perfumed with His breath.
2) His lips, as a fountain of righteousness flow,
To water the gardens of grace; 
From which their salvation the Gentiles shall know,
And bask in the smiles of His face.
3) He looks and ten thousands of angels rejoice,
And myriads wait for His word;
He speaks and eternity, filled with His voice,
Reechoes the praise of the Lord.

All the verses that would fill all the books ever written, couldn't do justice or describe the love and of God.</article>

I love this particular score with the minor notes adding to its beauty.</article>
	<article author="Charlotte Phelps" email="" city="Orange" provst="N.J." country="United States" month="3" day="6" year="2009">I learned this hymn in childhood. I sing it all the time for comfort. One verse I know is not on this sheet.  "He looks and ten thousands of angels rejoice.  And myriads wait for His voice.  He speaks and eternity filled with His word, Reechoes the sound of His love."</article>
