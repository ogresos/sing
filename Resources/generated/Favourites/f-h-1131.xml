	<article author="A sister in the Lord" email="wkmanu@gmail.com" city="Tema" provst="" country="Ghana" month="8" day="5" year="2015">1st John 2:1 "My little children, these things write I to you, that you sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:"
"In a low dungeon, hope we had none;
Tried to believe, but faith didn’t come;
God, our sky clearing, Jesus appearing,
We by God were transfused!
We by God were transfused!
Propitiation made by the blood,
Jesus’ redemption bought us for God!
No condemnation, justification!
We have peace toward God!
We have peace toward God!"
Praise God for our Lord Jesus Christ. In Him we have peace toward God, even the forgiveness of our sins. Thank You Lord Jesus. we Love You Lord. Amen.</article>
