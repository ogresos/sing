I would be so glad to find the complete music sheet to play and sing in my class. How can you help me? I would like to know the name of the author to congratulate him for this special lyrics and music. God bless you for sharing this hymn in the site.</article>
    <article author="Chris Shyy" email="" city="College Park" provst="MD" country="United States" month="12" day="15" year="2009">This hymn made me appreciate the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ so much more. God became man to make man God, in life and nature, but not in the Godhead. The only way was for the Word to become flesh and tabernacle among us. To Him be the Praise and Glory forever and ever! Amen!</article>
