SUBJECT: PRAISE OF THE LORD-HIS HUMANITY
METER: 8.7.8.7.D. with chorus.
AUTHOR: Witness Lee
COMPOSER: Herbert H. Booth

1	Dear Lord Jesus, we adore Thee,
 	 	”Seed of woman” Thou became;
 	Of the virgin wast begotten,
 	 	Called e’en with a human name.
 	Taking thus the human nature,
 	 	Thou as man the serpent trod;
 	By the Cross his head Thou bruised
 	 	And fulfilled the plan of God.
Chorus 
 	 	Lord, we see Thy glory,
 	 	Shown in human beauty,
 	 	Full of splendor, manifested
 	 	 	In humanity.
2	As a man, by incarnation,
 	 	Flesh and blood didst Thou partake
 	To destroy the devil, Satan,
 	 	In our stead and for our sake.
 	With the name of Jesus given
 	 	And Emmanuel called too,
 	Thou becam’st our precious Savior,
 	 	Bringing us salvation true.
3	Thou, “Last Adam” wast entitled,
 	 	And wast called the “second man”,
 	Head of all the new creation,
 	 	Better than the first man.
 	On this earth in life and conduct
 	 	Thou indeed wast Son of man;
 	Now in heaven with this nature
 	 	Thou dost still appear as man.
4	In the time which God appointed
 	 	Thou wilt come, dear Lord, again,
 	With the glory of the Father,
 	 	Still appearing as a man.
 	Even on the throne of judgment
 	 	Son of man Thou still wilt be;
 	And with this, our human nature,
 	 	Thou forevermore wilt be.</article>
