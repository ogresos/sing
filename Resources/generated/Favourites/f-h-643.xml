	<article author="Henrich Brockhaus" email="henrich.brockhaus@wwu.edu" city="Bellingham" provst="WA" country="United States" month="4" day="4" year="2016">I always thought it was "Take time to be holy." I like "behold Him" much better. To be holy is nothing to be measured in minutes or hours. As His redeemed we are Saints and we are to be holy, like He is holy, all the time. This is a matter of our existence, our very being! But to look at Him with full attention is different. We have to set time aside for this (devotion, or a quick look up during the time), because many things and responsibilities take our full attention, as they should.
Lord, help me look at You in the Spirit with all my heart and all my soul and all mind in order to love You more, to understand You more and to become more like You.</article>

Help me to make sacrifices in my time to really, deeply behold Your majesty. Lord, thank You that we are able to redeem the time to You. Lord Jesus, You are the most lovely one...Amen.</article>
	<article author="William Jeng" email="willjeng@gmail.com" city="Irvine" provst="CA" country="United States" month="3" day="6" year="2016">In college, so many things take up our time. Too many things occupy our hearts. Things precious to us: our grades, our jobs, our free time, our sleep... But every single day is a new beginning, and it's another chance to call His name and sing Him a love song. If we are serious with the Lord, we would spend our energy and time, even finances, for the church while we are still in school. Redeem the time by spending time with the Lord our BEST love! Day by day we can come to Christ to offer up our precious time for this precious one.</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="3" day="3" year="2016">"Here's a real Sunday morning hymn. Perhaps its used on Sunday mornings because that's a time of the big temptation to roll over and grab a little more of that shuteye, instead of getting up and going to church. Sleep isn't the only thing that takes time, however. You know how it is - you're so busy that you wind up with no time for the important things. Well, this song is just a reminder that everything you are, everything you have, comes from Someone else, not yourself. And while you're busy taking time for everything else, it would be a good idea to heed the song: 'Take time to be holy, speak oft with thy Lord, abide with Him always, and feed on His word.'"- Tennessee Ernie Ford's Favorite Hymns</article>

	<article author="Victor Olusegun Solomon" email="otolosnr@gmail.com" city="London" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="1" day="3" year="2016">Take time to behold Him. In our practise of beholding Him we also learn to know and walk in His presence, having many conversation with Him in secrecy.</article>

	<article author="NVK" email="nvk258@gmail.com" city="Evanston" provst="Illinois" country="United States" month="7" day="3" year="2015">This hymn has been playing inside me for almost 2 weeksâ€”fragmented in remembering the words!!
A sister asked that we sing this as prayer after a message that included II Corinthians 3:17.  Lord, If I neglect making time then time is wasted. I just want to behold You, gaze on You. 
I like the change from "be holy" to 'behold Him." If you understand that "be holy" is not an act or trained behavior; but a Person, a key quality of Him, the the original is better.  But so many have warped the understanding of "Holy".
Lord, in this darkening age keep the eyes of your people fixed on YOU, trusting Your unchanging Word.
Thank you for the short history of this hymn.</article>

But brothers and sister take at least 3-5 a day to behold Him. Some little duration of time is better than no duration of time at all. AMEN</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="5" day="31" year="2013">As Albert, 3/16/2009, said, the original says, "Take time to be holy". Both are good, but I think "take time to be holy" is more meaningful. We need to take time to be holy, and a big part of that is to take time to behold Him.

In stanza 1, lines 5-6 in the original are more down to earth:
Make friends of God's children;
Help those who are weak;
-----------------------------------------
The son of a wealthy ship merchant, William Longstaff was treasurer of his church and gave liberally to Christian causes. When evangelists D. L. Moody and Ira Sankey came to England, he assisted them financially, and he also wrote reports of the meetings for the Christian press.
A few years later Longstaff heard a sermon on the text "Be ye holy, for I am holy" and wrote down what holiness meant to him. A businessman at heart, Longstaff wrote no flowery or pious-sounding verses, but these down-to-earth thoughts.
The hymn appeared in a Christian newspaper in 1882 and was promptly forgotten. But years later composer George Stebbins, who was leading music in India in connection with evangelistic services there, remembered the poem when he was asked if there was a good hymn on living a holy life. Retrieving the newspaper clipping he had saved, he set the poem to music. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>

	<article author="Albert Meyer" email="" city="Plano" provst="TX" country="United States" month="3" day="16" year="2009">I know this hymn as: Take time to be holy, but I must admit that it is fixing our eyes on Jesus that the world fades away. Take time to behold Him is an excellent derivation of the original. Oh, I want to see Him, look upon His face!</article>
