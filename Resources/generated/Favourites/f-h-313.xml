	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="2" day="17" year="2015">The words that John Newton composed for his tombstone were publicized by George Beverly Shea:
"A most moving experience was visiting John Newton's gravesite in the churchyard. Don Hustad, long-time organist and musician on our team, was with me, and together we found the tombstone in a corner of the cemetery, very close to a centuries-old stone wall. Pushing aside some of the tall grass, I discovered some engraved words on the back of the stone. As I read them aloud, Don pulled an envelope from his pocket and quickly wrote them down. Standing there we rejoiced over John Newton's powerful testimony. These are the words:
John Newton, clerk, once an infidel and libertine,
a servant of slaves in Africa, was by the rich mercy
of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, preserved,
restored, pardoned, and appointed to preach the
faith he had long labored to destroy. 
Back in the US, in an RCA recording studio, when the red light went on and the orchestra began the opening of this beautiful hymn, I quoted John Newton's declaration of a life transformed. Words could scarcely better express the "amazing" part of grace." - 'How sweet the Sound' by George Beverly Shea
---------------
The last stanza was not written by Newton. It was first recorded in Harriet Beecher Stowe's immensely influential 1852 anti-slavery novel "Uncle Tom's Cabin". Three stanzas were emblematically sung by Tom in his hour of deepest crisis. He sings the 6th and 5th stanzas in that order [see Hannah's 9/9/2012 post for those stanzas], and Stowe included the now popular last stanza not written by Newton but that had been passed down orally in African American communities for at least 50 years. It was originally one of between 50 to 70 stanzas of a song titled "Jerusalem, My Happy Home" that first appeared in a 1790 book called "A Collection of Sacred Ballads". - Wikipedia</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="Mi" country="United States" month="1" day="18" year="2014">Around 1970 Christian Herald magazine polled its readers for their favorite hymns. Amazing grace was 9th on their all time favorite list. Here is their top 10:
1. The Old Rugged Cross
2. What a Friend We Have in Jesus
3. In the Garden
4. How Great Thou Art!
5. Sweet Hour of Prayer
6. Abide with Me
7. Rock of Ages
8. Nearer, My God, to Thee
9. Amazing Grace
10. Jesus, Lover of My Soul</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="Mi" country="United States" month="1" day="18" year="2014">"It helps me to interpret the words when I know that John Newton, the author, was the son of a sea captain, who, after his mother's death joined his father at age 11 on his ship.
I'm interested to know that he and his father apparently had a generation gap and they came to a parting of the ways, and that John's life turned into one of degradation - fighting, drinking, jail. Serving on a slave ship, he so infuriated the captain that he was made a slave of the slaves - another chapter in the Prodigal Son story. But then, somehow, John Newton came upon a copy of Thomas a Kempis' book, Imitation of Christ, and his heart responded. I can see him pondering those all-surrendering prayers of the author.
But it took a storm at sea in which Newton almost lost his life for him to turn everything over to God. He became a minister at age 39 and during his 15 year pastorate at Olney, England, he wrote the words to many hymns. The great composer William Cowper, also of Olney, set many of them to music and they collaborated on a famous hymnal. So with that background, I know what Newton is talking about when he writes about an amazing grace:
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found,
Was blind, but now I see."
- George Beverly Shea in "Songs that Lift the Heart"</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="3" day="17" year="2013">John Newton's tombstone, written by himself, says, "John Newton, clerk, once an infidel and Libertine, a servant of slavers in Africa, was, by the rich mercy of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, preserved, restored, pardoned, and appointed to preach the faith he had so long labored to destroy."

When it was suggested that Newton retire (at age 82!) due to poor health and a failing memory, he responded, "My memory is nearly gone, but I remember 2 things: that I am a great sinner, and that Christ is a great Savior!"

	<article author="Hannah" email="" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="9" day="9" year="2012">This song has three more verses:
Verse 3
Through many dangers, toils, and snares
I have already come;
'Twas grace that brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

Verse 5
Yes, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease
I shall possess within the veil
A life of joy and peace!

Verse 6
The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,
The sun forebear to shine;
But God, who called me here below
Will be forever mine.</article>

	<article author="Vicki" email="" city="Cleveland" provst="OH" country="United States" month="1" day="23" year="2012">Thank you I. Acosta for sharing the story of Captain/Pastor Newton. I truly enjoyed reading what you wrote of how Newton's faith had changed in the 1700's and wrote this song. He truly had the amazing grace experienced. Last August 2011, I too had this amazing grace experienced through listening to this Amazing Grace song after sometime my one cochlear implant was turned on. Gospel music is becoming more beautiful everyday as I practice listening to gospel music to both ears now. My right ear got activated today. I'm humbled.</article>
	<article author="Isaac Acosta" email="" city="Irvine" provst="CA" country="United States" month="10" day="18" year="2011">Imagine with me back to the year 1746. A ship is docking on the coast of West Africa. Its purpose is to snatch unsuspecting people and sell them as slaves in the far off countries. The captain of this ship is known far and wide for his debauchery, vulgarity and blasphemy. But one day in 1748, while reading the book "The Imitation of Christ" by Thomas a Kempis, our captain comes face to face with his sin and turns his life over to Jesus, the Savior of sinners. Our captain is John Newton. After his conversion and dedication to Christ, he became a pastor and hymn writer. His most famous of hymns, "Amazing Grace", is a testimonial of his conversion to Christ.

This is probably the most popular hymn in the English language. A television documentary was even made about it. Perhaps it is because its words so well describe the author: John Newton was a slave trader before coming to Christ. It was sung at the funeral of American president Ronald Reagan.</article>

	<article author="hymnal.net" city="" provst="" country="" month="8" day="25" year="2014">We are familiar with the hymn "Amazing Grace." Although this is a good hymn, it does not speak of the Triune God as our portion for our enjoyment. When this hymn was written, the experiential knowledge of God among the Lord's people had not come to this point. Even as recent as fifty years ago, Christians did not have the understanding of grace as the Triune God experienced and enjoyed by us. But standing on the shoulders of those who have gone before us, we have come to know that grace is far more than merely unmerited favor. Grace is the Triune God‚Äîthe Father, the Son, and the Spirit‚Äîprocessed for our experience and enjoyment.
