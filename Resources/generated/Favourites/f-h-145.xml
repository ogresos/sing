	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="6" day="1" year="2013">Isaac Watts once said that his aim was to see "David converted into a Christian." He meant singing the psalms was good but it would be better if they were infused with the gospel. He felt some psalms were unsuitable for Christian worship because they were written before the Cross of Christ and the completion of God's redemption and revelation.
This great missionary hymn is based on Psalm 72. There was no great mission effort when Watts wrote these words. Not until 60 years later did William Carey - the father of the modern missionary movement - sail for India. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>
