I recommend spending time (do not rush or hurry) to pray over each line and word, opening and confessing and conversing with your Lord.
There are seven stanzas.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="1" day="27" year="2009">If we want to be fully consecrated to the Lord, we must not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of our mind (v. 2b), which is the leading part of our soul. In other words, our body must be presented, and our soul must be transformed.

A human being is composed of a body, a soul, and a spirit (1 Thes. 5:23). Therefore, first we need to present our body, and then our soul needs to be transformed. We need to allow the Lord to work Himself into and throughout our soul. We have presented our body, but our person, our soul, may still be raw. Our mind may be old and worldly, our emotion may need to be renewed, and our will may be wild. Our entire soul may be raw, and raw material can never be used for the building. Thus, we need the Lord to be wrought into our soul. We must allow the Lord to transform all the inward parts of our soul, including our mind, emotion, and will.

Stanza 6 of Hymns, #439 says, "Waiting for the filling / Of the Host divine, / Who my inward parts shall / Perfectly refine." To refine is to renew, or transform. The phrase inward parts is a biblical term from Jeremiah 31:33, which says that the Lord will put His law in our inward parts. Our inward parts — our mind, emotion, and will — need to be refined, renewed, and transformed by the Lord. Then we will be not raw material but material good for the building.
