When we look away unto Him, not only He will infuse Himself into us, but also perfect our faith. "For thus says Jehovah, you will not see wind, nor will you see rain; but the valley will be filled with water, and you will drink, as your cattle and your animals." - II King 3:17. We know not what awaits us, but the Lord always takes care of us in a best way according to His plan. Just simply enjoy the Lord as grace, and looking unto Him, the Author and Perfecter of our faith. :)</article>
