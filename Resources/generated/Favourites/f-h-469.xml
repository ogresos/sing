	<article author="Evelyn Abotsi" email="evelynabotsi@yahoo.com" city="Accra" provst="Greater Accra" country="Ghana" month="1" day="11" year="2016">This is an old song. We sang it every where growing up. In church, at funerals, doing your chores at home etc.  I understood it, the meaning was clear but in a carnal way. Now in Christ Jesus, it touches my spirit, brings to my spirit an urgency that I'm here for a purpose, for a calling and to fulfill that calling, the mandate for which we in the world. Thank you! It's a great gift. God bless.</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="7" day="9" year="2013">For someone who struggled with illness much of her life, Frances Ridley Havergal wrote a remarkable number of vigorous, robust hymns. The last manuscript she worked on was "Starlight through the Shadows", a book for invalids. She died before she could complete the book, but her sister added the final chapter from Havergal's unpublished papers. That chapter is entitled "Marching Orders" and concludes with the words of this hymn. 
The hymn is based on 1 Chronicles 12:1-18. In the biblical text, the early followers of David are listed: archers and slingers, experts in running and swimming. David asked them whose side they were on, and they responded: "We are yours, David! We are on your side" (1 Chronicles 12:18). - Great Songs of Faith by Brown and Norton

In the original, there is no chorus, but there are 4 extra lines on the end of each stanza. The last 4 lines of each stanza have the same last 3 lines except for the final stanza 5. Here are the last 4 lines of each stanza:
1. By Thy call of mercy,
by Thy grace divine,
We are on the Lord's side -
Savior, we are Thine.

2. By Thy love constraining,
by Thy grace divine,
We are on the Lord's side -
Savior, we are Thine.

3. By Thy grand redemption
by Thy grace divine,
We are on the Lord's side -
Savior, we are Thine.

4. Joyfully enlisting,
by Thy grace divine,
We are on the Lord's side -
Savior, we are Thine.

5. Master Thou wilt keep us,
by Thy grace divine,
Always on the Lord's side -
Savior, we are Thine.</article>

Whether your candidate won or not, I believe this election was a unique call for all Christians to make a choice about their stand for God and His divine plan for this country's future. Our hope is not in who won but Who is, Who was and Who will forever be. Jesus Christ is our hope and our eternal joy.</article>

2 Timothy 2:19 says "Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness". 1 Kings 18:21 says "How long will you go hopping between two opinions? If Jehovah is God, follow Him; but if Baal is, follow him."

This hymn is a call to those who name the Lord's name that they would consecrate themselves to follow the Lord Jesus. It is a call to cut the compromise of worldly ties, and to take our stand as ones belonging to Christ, fighting for Christ. And it is in the Lord's loving redemption and by His grace that we may find our motivation and strength to take this stand.

Praise the Lord! Lord, we love You, because You first loved us, and purchased us at the cost of Your own life. Make us ever, only, all for You Lord Jesus!</article>

"Let us be right loyal
Noble, true, and bold."</article>
