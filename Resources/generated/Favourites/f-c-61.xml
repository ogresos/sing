	<article author="Han Eom" email="" city="Hamilton" provst="" country="New Zealand" month="8" day="5" year="2015">I was recently enlightened very much that only God is light.
Many times, I condemned myself with the doctrines I've heard but not with the real light of God. I thought I was in light, but I was in the greater darkness. 
Praise the Lord that only He is light!
Psalm 36:9 says this, " For with You is the fountain of life;/ In Your light we see light." The first light is the enlightening light from God, and the second light denotes the true nature of things. This means that we can only see the true nature of anything when we are in the light of God. Only sees the true nature of something when he lives in God's light.</article>
