One of the results is, without my hearing aids, I hear "streams of living water, which then makes me feel more at peace.</article>

This remains a remarkable experience for me and a testimony of the beauty of praise.
Thank you for making this song available on this platform.</article>

He was especially gifted as a hymn-mender. Many of the hymns submitted for this compilation were altered and improved by him. In spite of the fact that these were improvements, some people accused him of mutilating their hymns. His hymns have a freshness, simplicity, and rhythmic ease, the best-known being "The King of love my Shepherd is". - Songs of the Spirit by Martin</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="9" day="26" year="2013">When Henry Baker, an Anglican clergyman, was asked to compile a new hymnal for his church, he added this hymn, a paraphrase of Psalm 23, to the appendix of the hymnal. The fact that this hymnal sold more than 60 million copies indicates that he did his job well.
As Baker was dying, his last words came from the 3rd stanza of this hymn: "Perverse and foolish, oft I strayed, but yet in love He sought me." - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>

We moderns seem to be consumed with WANTING!
Evidently we do not know the Shepherd.</article>
