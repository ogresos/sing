He truly was imbued with love for God. His poem/prayer is inspiring, sublime and uplifting. Does he have other poems/prayers? I found a beautiful prayer in a Missalette for a Sunday Mass at St Joseph Church, Hawthorne California in August 1979. I will share it:   KNIT MY SOUL TO THEE, Let Your Love possess my whole being - my senses, my affections, my very life. Let It rule my work, my rest, my going and my staying. Let It comfort or afflict me, humble or exalt me, consuming my imperfections. God of Love, draw me into Thyself. Nothing shall terrify me! Confidently do I ask since Your longing to give is greater than mine to receive. Transform me into Thyself; that I may no longer know myself nor find myself but in Thee. Amen.</article>

It is interesting that Paul Gerhardt wrote this hymn near the time of his marriage to a woman he had long loved. He was a theologian with strong convictions, a student and teacher whose plans had long been frustrated by the 30 Years' War. As a young man he had passionately argued the finer points of Lutheran theology, but with age he had mellowed. His passion turned to the overwhelming love of God. At 45, he found a steady job in a small village, married his sweetheart, and began publishing his hymns. 
Nearly a century later, John Wesley heard Moravians singing this song in German as he sailed with them to America. Impressed by the rich hymns of the Moravians and by their deep personal devotion, Wesley translated many of their hymns [including this one] into English. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown and Norton
----------------------
The original first line starts with "Jesus" instead of "O Lord".
Another version of the song has the last 2 lines of the 1st stanza as:
To Thee alone, dear Lord, I live;
 Myself to Thee, dear Lord, I give.
---------------------------------------
There are additional stanzas after the 1st 3 above:
4. This love unwearied I pursue
 And dauntlessly to Thee aspire.
 Oh, may Thy love my hope renew
 Burn in my soul like heavenly fire!
 And day and night be all my care
 To guard this sacred treasure there.
--------------------------------------------------
5. My Savior, Thou Thy love to me
 In shame, in want, in pain, hast showed;
 For me, on the accursed tree,
 Thou pourest forth Thy guiltless blood;
 Thy wounds upon my heart impress,
 Nor aught shall the loved stamp efface.
--------------------------------------
6. More hard than marble is my heart,
 And foul with sins of deepest stain;
 But Thou the mighty Savior art,
 Nor flowed thy cleansing blood in vain;
 Ah soften, melt this rock, and may
 Thy blood wash all these stains away!
-----------------------------------
7. O that I, as a little child,
 May follow Thee, and never rest
 Till sweetly Thou hast breathed Thy mild
 And lowly mind into my breast!
 Nor ever may we parted be,
 Till I become as one with Thee.
--------------------------------------
8. Still let Thy love point out my way;
 How wondrous things Thy love hath wrought!
 Still lead me, lest I go astray;
 Direct my word, inspire my thought;
 And if I fall, soon may I hear
 Thy voice, and know that love is near.
---------------------------------------
9. In suffering be Thy love my peace,
 In weakness be Thy love my power;
 And when the storms of life shall cease,
 Jesus, in that important hour,
 In death as life be Thou my guide,
 And save me, who for me hast died.</article>
