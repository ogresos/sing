	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="9" day="23" year="2013">At the age of 80, John Newton was quite deaf and almost blind, but he still continued to preach. For his final messages, Newton brought an aide to the pulpit. The aide would read the next point of Newton's sermon outline, and Newton would then expound on that point.
On one particular Sunday, not long before Newton's death, the assistant read the first point and Newton said to the congregation, "Jesus Christ is precious." He paused and waited until the aide read the second point. Newton said again, "Jesus Christ is precious."
The aide reminded Newton that he had already said that. "Yes, I said it twice," the aged pastor replied, "and I'll say it again! Jesus Christ is precious." Then he asked the congregation to sing the hymn he had written many years before, "How Sweet the Name of Jesus Sounds." - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton
---------------------------------
In the original, this hymn is written with the singular personal pronoun throughout.
The original stanza 4 starts: "Jesus, my Shepherd, Husband, Friend"
The original last stanza ends:
And may the music of Thy name
Refresh my soul in death.
------------------------------
There is an additional stanza, which is usually omitted, between stanzas 3 &amp; 4:
By Thee my prayers acceptance gain,
Although with sin defiled;
Satan accuses me in vain,
And I am owned a child.</article>
