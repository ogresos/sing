It's such a reminder to me that it is nothing of ourselves that can help others, but only Christ! It doesn't matter what we say, but as long as we flow out the Christ that we've been enjoying, others surely will be shepherded by us! It's just the Christ lived out through us! Praise the Lord!!!</article>
    <article author="Elizabeth" city="Spokane" provst="WA" country="United States" month="5" day="30" year="2011">You and this song taught me something this morning, David. Even the precious gospel message is worth nothing unless the love of Christ, and the love for Christ that comes with it is accepted! Praise God! Praise Father, Son, and Holy Spirit with song and zeal for His coming Kingdom!</article>
    <article author="David" city="" provst="" country="Singapore" month="5" day="16" year="2010">Very true! We cannot despise prophecies, but even prophecies and knowledge will be rendered useless, for in part we know and in part we prophesy, but when that which is complete has come, then that which is in part will be rendered useless. But love will not ever fall away, the love of Christ, indeed the love of the Son of God who loved us and gave Himself up for us. For if we have prophecies and know all the mysteries and all the knowledge, and if we have all the faith so also to remove mountains, but do not have love, we are nothing. May the Lord enlarge our heart to love all our brethren in the Lord, to cherish every one of them, to pray for each one of them, even as the Lord Himself also loves us, we who are absolutely unworthy of His love.</article>
