Most of them are on the themes of trust and obedience. You can Google him for more info. As with all writers, time has a way of sifting out the poorer hymns and leaving the best and this is definitely his best. We still sing it regularly in our Methodist Church.</article>

	<article author="Michael Patrick King" email="micking1953@gmail.com" city="Bostonia" provst="California" country="United States" month="5" day="23" year="2016">This is the very essence of Faith: Trust and Obey. In Hebrews, the eleventh chapter, we are shown some factual statements about faith but not its actual definition. True, it is the substance of things hoped for, and it is the evidence of things not seen. However, neither of these things nor the sum of them together equals the nature of Faith. Faith is doing your part in a relationship whether or not you see your partner doing his. In the salvific relationship a Christian enjoys with his Lord, it consists of trusting God and obeying Him, even when the fruits of such trust and obedience are not evident. Only then does the Author of Hebrews' words' meaning become clear: Faith is the substance of the heavenly reward that you hope for; it is the assurance of the fruits of your faith that you cannot yet see.</article>

I personally love to sing and want to give you a few verses in the Bible that talk about singing, Psalm 30:4 Sing praise to the LORD you Godly ones and give thanks to His Holy name. Psalm 47:6 Sing praises to God, sing praises; Sing praises to our King, sing praises. These are just a few but the Psalms have lots more. I would encourage you to read the psalms and to hylight every time it says sing. GOD BLESS and I hope I was of some help.</article>

	<article author="Emmanuel Hammond" email="ek.hammond@yahoo.com" city="Accra" provst="Greater Accra" country="Ghana" month="5" day="24" year="2015">‚ÄúIf you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father‚Äôs commandments and abide in his love‚Äù John 15:10 ESV
The ‚Äòcommandment‚Äô as used in this context is ‚Äòentol√©‚Äô (in Greek) and refers to ‚Äúorder, command, law, injunction, precept,‚Äù The ‚Äòlove‚Äô is ‚Äòagap√©‚Äô (in Greek) and refers to ‚Äúlove, goodwill‚Äù.
This clearly tells us that when we live by the Lords precepts (instruction/teaching), we remain in His love and goodwill (kindness). I personally believe that although the Lord loves everyone, He has some ‚Äòspecial attention/kindness‚Äù for those who obey Him. Abraham trusted and obeyed God, becoming the friend of God and being blessed abundantly.
May God give us the grace to obey Him, to live by His precepts as His Spirit leads us.</article>

To be completely devoted to Him, no matter what! 
A man I so deeply respect for His knowledge of God once said, it's not that I have had any unusual revelation but one thing I learn early in my walk with God is to obey Him in small dealings of the day.
Lord, help me to grow more and more in this life of obedience.</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="10" day="11" year="2013">This song was written after a D. L. Moody evangelistic meeting in Brockton, Massachusetts. Daniel Towner was the song leader that night in 1886, and he asked the people to share how they had been saved. Several stood and spoke of how certain they felt of their salvation. But then a young man rose and said, "I am not quite sure, but I am going to trust, and I am going to obey."
Towner couldn't forget that testimony. He jotted it down and sent it to John Sammis, who had recently left a career in business to enter the ministry, with the hope that Sammis would find in it the inspiration for a hymn text. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown and Norton

I love this hymn because, as do many parts of the Bible, it expresses the wonderful working together of faith and works. It is hard to define, but it is not hard to experience.</article>

	<article author="Theophilus Ojuola (awojuola)" email="yemojuola@aol.com" city="New York City" provst="New York" country="United States" month="6" day="15" year="2013">God bless the composer(s) of this timeless Hymnal. It reminds me of my early childhood in the 1960's and fills my heart with nostalgia of the elementary school days. An era of Christian Mission schools in Nigeria, when children were taught early to fear God through obedience to parents, pastors, teachers, elders and government officials. Unfortunately, the legacy of this era was not preserved for succeeding generations and what we have today is a society where majority of children lack obedience and trust only in their own ability. They are children of disobedience being nurtured by the prince of the air.
This song should become a "Revival Song" which can take us back to the basics of trusting (faith) God and obeying his word. Jesus tells us in the Gospel, that the Father loves Him because He always does what pleases Him (the Father). Jesus attained His
preeminence through faith in the Father and obedience to His Will: "Then said I, lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God." (Heb. 10:7)

So, as Scripture points out, Jesus, the Son of God points the way out through faith (trust) and obedience (doing) God's will. God bless us all at all times in Jesus' name - Amen!</article>

	<article author="Anna Soh" email="annasoh18@gmail.com" city="Sydney" provst="New South Wales" country="Australia" month="3" day="7" year="2013">Trust and Obey is not talking about obeying the law but the direction of the Holy Spirit. If you truly trust in Jesus you would have handed all your past hurts, hang ups and habits to His tender loving care.
In it's place the Holy Spirit will come to live in you and in so doing you have to listen to the whisper of His ever so gentle voice and you will obey what you are being told as it will be personal and in your best interest to obey, otherwise saying you trust (have faith) is meaningless. Once you trust (believe) Jesus you will obey your Lord and Saviour.
I am sure the song is not referring to the rituals but like Abraham by faith he lived and in so doing was able to hear the voice and personal instructions from God and obeyed. There is no commandment that asks you to kill your own child. In fact, killing Isaac would have caused Abraham to break the law "Thou shall not kill" which also wasn't around during Abraham's time.
God also knew David killed and still called him a "Man after My Own Heart".
What Jesus wants us to do is to let go everything into His loving care and the Holy Spirit will come to live in you. I know as I live by trusting (believing) in Jesus and in so doing He even helps me to keep my faith and helps me to obey God's word by the power of the Holy Spirit.
That is why when I do the right thing I cannot boast as I have not achieved this ability to do the right thing on my own strength and sinful nature. However, by the power of the Holy Spirit, I am helped in all things and He protects me and will bring me home to God.
I will be able to stand before the throne of God not because of what I have done but purely by the righteousness of Jesus and because I have trusted and obeyed the instructions of the Holy Spirit to live my life according to God's Will.
As you can see I do not refer to any particular verse in the Bible but if you know the Bible you will know that I am referring to all that is taught in the Bible just like the young man who stood up at that meeting all those years ago without any scriptural learning. He definitely had the Holy Spirit guiding him to say those words that although I don't understand I will trust and obey and he is definitely speaking of the whispers he is hearing ever since he handed his life over to Christ Jesus our Lord and Saviour.
Do you seriously believe the Holy Spirit did not have a hand in guiding all concerned for this hymn to be written?
To try and do the works on your own strength is to set yourself up for a fall and if you do it by your own strength than you are boasting that you are able to obey God on your own strength. If it is by the power of the Holy Spirit then you have nothing to boast about just like me and that young man who spoke up at that meeting so long ago!</article>

	<article author="Gary" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="1" day="21" year="2013">To David and Elaine,

Paul was addressing the Jews who were trying to get the Gentiles to be circumcised in order to be saved. The Jews were trying to gain righteousness and justify themselves through their own circumcision rather than faith through Jesus Christ (Rom 2:24-2:29). This is the context with which Romans 3:19-20 is stated, declaring that whether Jew or Gentile, we cannot gain righteousness through our own "circumcision" and works (Romans 3:29-30). However, the law is not nullified because of faith, but we through faith establish the Law. (Romans 3:31) Therefore 1 Samuel 15:22 ("...to obey is better than sacrifice...") is not nullified because of faith through Jesus Christ (Matthew 5:17).

Obedience is essential to develop a healthy relationship with God. Faith establishes the relationship, but obedience (not religious rituals) maintains it. Jesus Himself spoke about the importance of obedience:

"Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven." - Matthew 7:21

Many who do things in Jesus' name are cast away; He does not even know them! Why? Because they were not doing the will of the Father (Matthew 7:22-23). It is important to note that the difference between the wise and foolish builder is not the one who hears the Word of God, but rather the one who does according to the Word of God (Matthew 7:24-27). Why would Jesus command us if we are not expected to obey? (John 13:34-35) Did not Jesus Himself obey the Father, even to death on the cross? (Luke 22:42; Philippians 2:8) We are not above Jesus, but rather we should be like Him (Luke 6:40).

Obedience is the fruit of faith (Luke 6:43-49). Faith comes from hearing the Word; obedience perfects that faith. James 2 states that even the demons believe in God (James 2:19), but our faith is useless without the works to show that faith (James 2:20). Abraham, who trusted in God, obeyed His command to sacrifice his son Issac (Genesis 22:1-22; note v22). Romans 4:3 states that Abraham was justified by faith, but James 2:21 states that Abraham was justified by works in his obedience to God (when he offered up Issac per God's command). How can this be? Abraham's faith allowed him to trust and therefore obey God (Hebrews 11:17-19), and it was through obedience that Abraham's faith was perfected (James 2:22-23). We cannot be justified by faith alone, for faith that does not bear the fruit of obedience is dead (James 2:24,26).

Sorry for the very lengthy explanation, but Scripture does show that obedience allows us to be "happy in Jesus" (in our continued relationship with God the Father) per the writer's lyrics. David, I hope this clarifies Scripture for you (I mean no offense), and Elaine, I hope that this can encourage you and your acquaintance to sing this hymn in faith and in truth.

Hope this helps.</article>
	<article author="David Buckwitz" email="buck3486@sbcglobal.net" city="Hazel Park" provst="Michigan" country="United States" month="1" day="6" year="2013">I am directing my comment to: "Elaine" of Miami Florida and this is my response to her questions dated 9/18/12. Your Pastor, aquaintance is absolutely correct! The only obedience the Father accepts from us is "perfect" obedience. The hymn "Trust and Obey" does not line up with God's Word. Trust is another word for "Faith" and of itself is "Wonderous" but when mixed with "obey", then the hymn is not singing about Grace but speaks of law, flesh and death. When you placed your faith in Christ to save you from sin, God the Father replaced your inability to "obey" God's laws with His Son's ability. By faith and nothing else you became the "Righteousness of God in him." There is no longer room for the efforts of man to please God by obedience. The Law was fulfilled by Jesus, not by man and his "religious effort to obey" (2 Cor. 5:21) "For he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him." (Romans 3:19-20) "Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. Therefore, by the deeds of the law (or man's attempts to obey it) there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin." A better verse for the hymn should read: Trust and BELIEVE! Elaine, The Lord Bless you and you loved ones in this new year.
Your brother In Christ.</article>

	<article author="John Emilimor" email="" city="Lagos" provst="" country="Nigeria" month="10" day="27" year="2012">What a blessed soul stirring hymn, from as far back as my elementary school days when we did this hymn during the morning assembly, it has always blessed my soul and inclined me to a life of more consecration and strong desire to walk in obedience to the Master. Trust (faith) and obedience remain the surest key to a happy life in Christ Jesus, our Lord and Saviour. I do hope that more congregations will restore the art of hymn singing in thier worship services and help the on-coming generation to tap into the depths of spirituality that hymns like this deliver to the church environment. God bless you all.</article>
	<article author="Elaine" email="" city="Miami" provst="Fla" country="United States" month="9" day="18" year="2012">This song speaks to ME. However, I have an aquaintance who would refuse to have his congregation sing this wonderful hymn. He is stuck on the refrain "Trust and Obey, for there is no other way, to be happy in Jesus...". Are there other ways to be happy in Jesus...I mean to be truly happy in Jesus. Isn't Obedience better than sacrifice, and did He not tell us to Go!!

	<article author="Francis Orji" email="" city="Toronto" provst="Ontario" country="Canada" month="7" day="16" year="2011">The Lord asked me a question during week. Why do men lie? As I thought about it, it occurred to me that because most times they do not have the power or resources to bring to pass what they promised. God is not a man that should lie or the son of man that should repent. All powers in heaven and on earth are with Him. All resources are at His disposal. That includes men. So be rest assured. What He said He will do He will do.</article>

Heb 11:8 By faith - believing what God had said unto him expressing confidence in the person who had promised
 Abraham, the individual whom God had called (when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; - this was Abraham's heart response to God's call and he went out, - this was Abraham's physical response to what his heart had already responded to not knowing whither he went. - he had never been in the place before. He believed that God was going to provide what He promised.</article>
