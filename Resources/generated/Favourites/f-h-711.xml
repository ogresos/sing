Amen...Lord I trust and believe in You.</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="4" day="4" year="2014">Mr. Bliss lost his life in the terrible railroad wreck at Ashtabula, Ohio. His trunk, however, reached Chicago safely, as it had gone before by another train. In his trunk was discovered this hymn.
Mr. Bliss had rearranged the words of the poem to some extent, and had composed the tune. Sentence by sentence, the words are full of pathetic [archaic use meaning "sorrowful"] interest in connection with the authorâ€™s sudden death so soon afterward. - Story of Gospel Hymns by Ira Sankey</article>

Many times throughout the day (morning, noon and even 2 AM) I would come to this song and my heart, mind and soul would be refocused!! Praise God for the comfort He gives us in times of trials!!</article>
	<article author="Huyen Nguyen" email="" city="Garden Grove" provst="CA" country="United States" month="8" day="21" year="2010">I was also really touched by this song, "And o'er each step of my onward way, He makes new scenes to rise; and every joy He sends me comes a sweet and glad surprise. So on I go not knowing; I would not if I might; I'd rather walk in the dark with God than go alone in the light; I'd rather walk by faith with Him than go alone by sight." - I Corinthians 2:9 But as it is written,"Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard and which have not come up in man's heart; things which God has prepared for those who love Him." Amen! :)</article>

O Lord may this hymn govern the rest of my life. I know not what awaits me but the Lord always takes care of us in the best way!</article>
