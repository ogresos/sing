	<article author="Elizabeth Clark" email="" city="Mansfield" provst="OH" country="United States" month="4" day="7" year="2011">We have a women's retreat coming up in Nov 2011 here at Spruce Hill, Mansfield, OH. We invited several women from all walks of life to join this retreat. The General Subject is: The All-Inclusive Christ and the Omniscient Father. This song will be our theme song! It's really a very very good one! Women have different situations, different needs with all differences from one another--that is why our Lord is all-inclusive to meet all our needs and situations--and our heavenly Father is omniscient knowing us better that we know ourselves. He knows us, loves us and would never give up on us because we are His child. The Lord cherishes us, nourishes us until we grow in His divine life! I always sing this song many times everyday, And I read one section of the book: "The All-Inclusive Christ" each day. Oh, what a supply to my spirit, and what a release when I sing this song! Amen, Lord, thank You, I love You so much!</article>
	<article author="L.C." email="" city="San Juan" provst="M.M." country="Philippines" month="1" day="29" year="2011">This hymn is very encouraging. The Lord's gift of righteousness, the depth of His love and how far His mercy goes for us is just so marvelous and wonderful!

In our small group meeting a while ago, we enjoyed Hebrews 4. The Lord knows our every situation. He knows our history. He is also able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart. And there is no creature that is not manifest before Him. (Heb. 4:12-13). And verse 15 says, "For we do not have a High Priest who cannot be touched with the feeling of our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all respects like us, yet without sin." 

So whatever our condition maybe, the Lord knows. The Lord Jesus is so faithful to us. He is just waiting for our wandering heart to come back to Him. Lord Jesus, we love You! Lord, cause us to be desperately in love with You.</article>
	<article author="Rebecca" email="" city="Tokyo" provst="" country="Japan" month="10" day="23" year="2010">The Lord is always waiting for us to turn to Him.

	<article author="Manilyn" email="" city="Oroquieta City" provst="Misamis Occidental" country="Philippines" month="9" day="16" year="2010">Oh Lord Jesus, I love You.

Lord, day by day cause us to call Your name, taste Your grace and also we can exercise our spirit. AMEN.</article>
	<article author="Armand Tongo" email="" city="Caloocan City" provst="" country="Philippines" month="7" day="7" year="2010">This song reminds us that God really loves us, even we are in a far place, His love still reaches us.

Once I was singing this hymn, I suddenly realized that my Lord Jesus is the very person that really knew everything about me, He knew my deepest thought and all my history, and He and I are in such a close and intimate relationship! He must be the One I can turn to all the time, for He has really known what I am going through. Praise the Lord!!!</article>
