I really enjoyed that God can be joy and peace, God can be blessing, God can be all these things. BUT - without Christ as the center of all these items, they are just mere things. Praise the Lord that in the church life we are not following something or someone, we are simply following Christ!!! 
So to see this vision is to see our Lord as the CENTER and REALITY of everything we enjoyed. We can see justification in Romans, by do we see that God IS justification? That God IS joy? We really need to see Christ as the reality of everything. The Bible is just Christ Himself! And as witnesses of this vision, we must speak forth what we have seen! The vision demands a response!</article>

Are we content with God alone or our we as His people for ever seeing experances and the Feel good factor? In Him we have everything of any real value. There is a constant drawing to God Himself provided by The Holy Spirit. Martha. said Jesus Mary has chosen the better part, so may we. Glory!</article>

	<article author="Salem Long" email="salemlong@utexas.edu" city="Austin" provst="Texas" country="United States" month="11" day="16" year="2014">I always thought that there was a typo in this song.
"The way that leads to Him must needs be strait."
But actually, the word strait here was used intentionally—it doesn't mean that our path to the Lord is "straight". In dear brother Frances Brook's time, "strait" had the meaning of the word narrow, in addition to being the name of a channel of water.
This reflects Matthew 7:14, which says 
"Because narrow is the gate and constricted is the way that leads to life, and few are those who find it."</article>
	<article author="At" email="" city="Santa Ana" provst="California" country="United States" month="1" day="28" year="2014">This hymn conveys the experience of someone who despite the pain and loss, consider his supreme reward to be God Himself…willing to take "any road" by "any cost." Yet realizing that he cannot get himself there, he iterates, "Tis His to lead me there--not mine." 

Yet again, reiterates "But His" as if He is telling himself and us the readers "I cannot will myself to get to where I need to be because I have lost all my will power to do so, but it is 'His will' to get there." This is proven by the words in stanza 2 which state: "so faith bounds forward to its goal in God." Here the author is experiencing being "bound" by the faith which has been infused into the depths of his being. 

Unable to retract or regress from the Christian journey he has begun, he has no choice but to remain bound. However, although bound and unbeknownst to him, he is making progress. In like manner, we at times we may give up and retract from the course as if all hope is gone and our faith disappeared. It is precisely at this juncture that we find ourselves "bound" by the faith we have received. 

This precious faith, which is the very God Himself, cannot and will not let us go. Rather, this faith is personafied in such a way, that it is becomes a Person who upholds us and thus, our "soul follows hard." That is, hardships are hard, yet this Person in us follows harder. The pain is hard to bear, yet He is the inner strength that strives harder to carry us through. While there exists an inexplicable abyss that surrounds us outwardly coupled with perpetrating inner turmoil that besets us constantly; God still continues, unaffected, to carry out what He has willed to do by any means, at any cost, by any road "until [He] God hath full fulfilled [our] deepest prayer "to "reach the mark" where God is--in His glory. It is there where we truly find our "great Reward." That Reward my fellow sufferers in Christ is the very God who called us when we were once in darkness…Who is now leading us to "full" glory. It's all or nothing at all.</article>

I too have desired this, and still plod along the road which leads to Him Himself. Many tears, but I cannot turn from this road He has put me on and planted into my heart....</article>
	<article author="Maria Rodriguez" email="mariarodriguez7007@yahoo.com" city="Denton" provst="Texas" country="United States" month="5" day="26" year="2013">Lord Jesus, make this prayer a reality! Using this song in my wedding ceremony, Lord I want You to be the center and expression on our wedding day. All glory and praise to You, Lord.</article>
	<article author="Pearl" email="fastflowingriver@yahoo.co.uk" city="" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="2" day="10" year="2013">I was indulging in a little self pity this morning about a situation which has been perplexing me for some time now. As usual I had been enquiring of the Lord for the "solution" whilst at the same time feeling guilty at my own reactions which I know to be soulish. I told the Lord I needed to be comforted and He reminded me of this hymn.
 I wanted a situation to turn out joyful and peaceful and concerned because I did not understand. But He, this Precious, Marvellous, Wonderful One has led me to Himself. So once again He has me.</article>
	<article author="Vivipeter" email="peter@yahoo.com" city="Gardengrove" provst="CA" country="United States" month="2" day="2" year="2013">:-) Thoroughly enjoyed this hymn during the CSU Fullerton retreat before school started. Won't forget the pleasant memories when we sung this with Martin, Yeezy, Frank, CrystAllison, and Alissa after the home meeting.</article>
	<article author="Joshua Mallory" email="jrmallory2@verizon.net" city="Denton" provst="Texas" country="United States" month="11" day="28" year="2012">Amen....brother Alex...Amen...O Lord Jesus, help us. Lord have mercy on us...
May this prayer always be ours. The Lord needs us...Amen.</article>
	<article author="Alex" email="" city="Belfast" provst="Antrim" country="United Kingdom" month="3" day="24" year="2012">I reckon that this prayer is a 'dangerous' one as our dear Saviour takes us at our word.... just as we take Him at His. 

However - always well worth it. Our delight is to delight Him and I believe this prayer does give Him huge JOY.</article>
	<article author="T. Diyan" email="" city="London" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="2" day="15" year="2012">Lord please be my only love and my only desire. Lord Jesus please do it.

	<article author="Mariam" email="" city="Yerevan" provst="" country="Armenia" month="1" day="29" year="2011">I love this hymn very much. I enjoy it greatly any time I sing it. I just can't say which is my favourite stanza, because they all touch me very much. One thing I know, I cannot say to Him nay! Amen!</article>
	<article author="Lonnie Sessums" email="" city="Salem" provst="OR" country="United States" month="5" day="13" year="2010">My physician gave this hymn to me. When one gets so low in mind and spirit, all that really matters is God Himself. His Presence alone can lift one up from the pit of despair. My goal is to 'ask'...'seek'...and 'knock' that I might find God Himself in all His glory.
Jesus taught us to do that in Matthew 7:7. Awesome!</article>
	<article author="Theodore" email="" city="Gallatin" provst="Tn" country="United States" month="1" day="28" year="2010">This song comes again and again to my heart in the pursuit of this God of glory who loved us to death on the cross of Christ. Eternal life is knowing GOD and Jesus Christ (John 17:3). To taste of Him is to want more of this beautiful Jesus. Do you know Him?</article>
	<article author="Dora Yao" email="" city="Long Island" provst="NY" country="United States" month="9" day="15" year="2009">Oh Lord!  How enlightening to sing this hymn.

	<article author="Jose Zarate Jr." email="" city="Mexico city" provst="" country="Mexico" month="7" day="6" year="2009">God Himself is our only goal! By the faith that He has infused into us we know that everything else is vain. Oh, what a joy! He Himself is our everything!</article>
	<article author="nick sanchez" email="" city="dimond bar" provst="ca" country="United States" month="4" day="19" year="2009">O Lord Jesus. Our goal is God himself. Nothing else is worth living for. No words an express such love, but this hymn comes close.</article>
	<article author="Linda Crutchfield" email="" city="Houston" provst="Texas" country="United States" month="12" day="13" year="2008">God is so good to those who seek, but what to those who find? We press on to know carried in the arms of the Blessed Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ.</article>

	<article author="Clare Lin" email="" city="Cerritos" provst="CA" country="United States" month="11" day="1" year="2008">Praise the Lord! He has the best plan for us. His intentions are always good. No matter what may come up in our daily living, if we simply continue to trust and lean on Him, depending on Him as our only One, He will lead us on. Oh, how we just love You, Lord Jesus!</article>
	<article author="Jimena Johnson" email="" city="Santa Cruz de la Sierra" provst="" country="Bolivia" month="4" day="27" year="2008">Beloved, do not think that the fiery ordeal among you, coming to you for a trail, is strange, as if it were a strange thing happening to you; but inasmuch as you share in the sufferings of Christ, rejoice! for the God of all grace, he who has called you into His eternal glory in Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a little while, will Himself perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground you!!</article>
	<article author="Stephen Barber" email="" city="Los Angeles" provst="CA" country="U.S.A." month="4" day="21" year="2007">No matter at any cost, no matter at any price, we still pursue towards our goal, God. We are becoming this lovely one, and it is not by any of our trying, but it is through the Lord's boundless love. We exercise our will to choose Him, and He does the rest.

May we pursue God Himself in all situations in glory to glory.</article>
