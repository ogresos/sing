Tremendously powerful, especially since it is so true that Jesus is going to "keep us from the hour of temptation", as long as we "hold fast to which thou hast, that no man take thy crown." I have been given six warnings in 2012 alone that Jesus will rapture us, His Church, very, very soon. (and I know I am not the only person within the Body of Christ who is being warned!) This event draws closer and closer to us with each passing day. May we each be willing to do the work the Lord has called and ordained us to do before this moment arrives, and may we-each of us, hold fast to our reward. Maranatha; Come, Lord Jesus!</article>
