----------------------------------------------------------------------
 " There are many things that are old that are very good and do bind us. For example 1 John 2:7 &amp; 2 John 1:6 say we need to keep the old commandment. "
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Now in this song you say "turn from tradition" is a better line. This inconsistency makes me wonder if you are just hunting for things in these songs to object to.</article>

	<article author="Ed" email="edsiew@hotmail.com" city="Hong Kong" provst="" country="" month="12" day="16" year="2013">Whoever wrote this song KNOWS of the plan of God. It cannot be obtained by learning, only by divine revelation. By 'turning from the prophets', Jews are exhorted to turn from relying on their lineage from Abraham. This is the dispensation of grace, no longer under the dispensation of law, which has been found to be wanting in reconciling men to God.

The point of it all IS TO BECOME OVERCOMERS. Only overcomers are the Man-Child in revelation: Christians who are fully grown, fathers in Christ, and at the same time is childlike because only a child can enter into the kingdom. 

The Man-Child represents the perfected overcoming church. The left behind church after the Man-Child has been raptured is the woman who were given two wings to flee into the wilderness: praise and prayers are her wings. 

This remaining church is represented by the ten virgins who were friends of the Bride but not the Bride. Five were found to lack in grace and did not make it, the other five entered to partake in the wedding supper.

We do have to make a final crossing, hallelujah! The Spirit and the Bride say Come!</article>
	<article author="Kevin Lee" email="brotherkevinlee_poracanministrys@yahoo.com" city="Dipolog City" provst="" country="Philippines" month="11" day="22" year="2013">Acts 3:22 says Moses said, "A Prophet will the Lord your God braise up unto you from your brothers, like me; Him shall you hear in whatever things He speaks to you.

According to the Matthew 17:8 (RcV) footnote 1 says: "Peter proposed to keep Moses and Elijah, i.e., the law and the prophets, with Christ, but God took Moses and Elijah away, leaving no one except Jesus Himself. The law and the prophets were shadows and prophecies, not the reality; the reality is Christ. Now that Christ, the reality, is here, the shadows and prophecies are no longer needed. No one except Jesus Himself should remain in the New Testament. Jesus is today's Moses; as such, He imparts the law of life into His believers. Jesus is also today's Elijah; as such, He speaks for God and speaks forth God within His believers. This is God's New Testament economy."

Of course we come to Christ not only through our human spirit to contact Him but as well as the Word. But coming to Word is only by means of exercising our spirit to touch Christ and found life. The writer of this hymn was not assuming or saying to separate Christ and the Word. He was mainly referring to the shadows and prophecies spoken by the prophets. If you have the shadows and prophecies of the law of the prophets without Christ even though they had foretold concerning Christ. It is meaningless, just a dead letter. I believe the writer of this hymn was to trying to say that the Pharisees and the scribes care only the written Word of the Old Testament spoken by the prophets, yet they did come to seek Him as life. So, they separate Christ and the Word. You cannot have reality spoke by the prophets of keeping the commandments of God without Christ Himself. "This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I have found My delight. Hear Him!"</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="8" day="25" year="2013">We do not separate Christ from the Word. We do not turn away from God's Word to turn to Christ. We turn to Christ through the word, and we read the word with Christ and coming to Christ. 

2 Peter 1:19 We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:
20 Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
21 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</article>

When the Lord was transfigured in the mount, Moses and Elijah appeared with Him, but then a voice from heaven said,"This is my Son the Beloved, hear Him!" We need to be absolutely turned not just from the law but even from the prophets unto Christ HImself....He is our portion. We just have to enjoy Him....</article>
	<article author="Elizabeth" email="" city="Spokane" provst="WA" country="United States" month="12" day="4" year="2011">Thank you, Steve. You are exactly right! It should say, "Turn from tradition." The prophets spoke only the words that Christ, as God, gave them. He is the Word, and the Word is always in agreement with Him. To turn from the true word is to turn from the True Word, Christ Himself.</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="12" day="3" year="2011">Elizabeth is correct. It is a mistake in the song to say "turn from the prophets" (Acts 13:27 &amp; many others). It could say, "Turn from tradition" instead.</article>
	<article author="Ben" email="" city="Amherst" provst="NY" country="United States" month="11" day="30" year="2011">The reason that this song says turn from the prophet, is because we have the Son! As we saw on the Mount of Transfiguration, Christ was in contrasted with the Son. In the OT they should have listened to the prophets, but in the NT praise the Lord we have the Son Himself, the Real Prophet!</article>
	<article author="Elizabeth" email="" city="Spokane" provst="WA" country="United States" month="4" day="22" year="2011">I love this song and sing it often-as well as the "virgins must be wise and pure," but why does it say, "turn FROM the prophets"? If the Jews had truly turned TO the prophets in Christ's day, they would have recognized who He was. They had turned from the prophets and that was the problem. The Pharisees had won them over to their worldly way of thinking-just as the churches today have been won over to the world. Christ is the Word and His Word is not to be turned from but turned to!</article>
