We're not waiting to go to a physical place--heaven. We're day by day becoming what we will be for eternity--the corporate mingling of divinity with humanity. We simply need to cooperate with the Lord, day by day--to live out and work out the New Jerusalem. We live in the reality of this holy city to become it. We work out such a consummation, dispensing the divine reality to others to build up the New Jerusalem. Thank the Lord for such a song.</article>
