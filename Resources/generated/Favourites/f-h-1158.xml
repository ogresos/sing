 Yet I would not change my standing;
All I long for is the peace Thy love would bring.
All I yearn for is Thy coming
 And Thy presence’ sweet embrace.
Dear Lord Jesus,thou are my love and satisfaction,
 Thou are my everlasting portion,
 Nothing else would I pursue.
 Who like Thee—so sweet and lovely?
 None can e’er compete with Thee!</article>

We have this precious, matchless One inside of us! From withing our heart we can enjoy His voice, calling us again and again away from all the other loves, casting away all our hard feelings and causing us to rejoice in Him and be at peace with Him and ourselves. We become His eternal pleasure, and He becomes our satisfying portion for ever. Hallelujah!</article>
