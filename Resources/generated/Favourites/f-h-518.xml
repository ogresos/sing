The original says "winepress" instead of "serpent" in stanza 1. The Lord already destroyed the serpent, Satan, for us by His death (Heb 2:14). When He comes back, the Lord will tread in the winepress of the wrath of God those who oppose Him (Rev 19:15). So, I think "serpent" is an improvement over "winepress" because destroying the serpent is a much greater benefit to us, the Lord paid His life to do it, and He already did it.

hymnary.org wrongly attributes this hymn to Thomas R. Birks. Apparently, Birks wrote a different hymn with the same first line also based on Psalm 73:25.</article>
