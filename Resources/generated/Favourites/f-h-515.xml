He does not desire our posessions. He wants our being. In like manner, He has given all that He is to us, holding nothing of Himself back. He has given Himself to us so that we would take Him and enjoy Him to the uttermost. In like manner, He desires that we open our entire being to Him that He may have and enjoy us as well. How sweet and precious our dear Lord Jesus is. Amen Lord, we give ourselves to you unreservedly. Enjoy us as we enjoy You.</article>
