	<article author="Lisa Chiang" email="clisa928@gmail.com" city="Los Angeles" provst="California" country="United States" month="3" day="4" year="2016">Although I know Christ is life and peace and all these things that I desire, yet often I still miss the mark because I'm yearning for these things apart from Christ. But none other than a PERSON can satisfy. Lord I want to seek You first - not as an antidote or solution to this and that situation, but even just to enjoy You and be satisfied by You.</article>

	<article author="John" email="boycelondon44@gmail.com" city="Lancing" provst="West Sussex" country="" month="7" day="14" year="2014">“Broken cisterns” are spoken of in Jeremiah 2:13, where the Lord berates His people for committing two sins, (i) forsaking Him, the Fountain of Living Waters, and (ii) digging their own cisterns which leaked, so any water in them was lost. Water is (as we all know from experience) essential to life. Water satisfies. Living Water, Water of Life, is also seen in John 4:14; 7:37-39; Ezekiel 47:1-12 and Revelation 22:1, 2. “He that is athirst, let him come: he that will, let him take the water of life freely” (v 17 RV; Isaiah 55:1). I hope meditating on these verses blesses you.</article>
	<article author="Tom" email="" city="Milwaukee" provst="" country="" month="5" day="30" year="2014">An empty cistern is not only a worldly pleasure. It is also my unhealed vessel (soul) that is full of holes and lets water leak out. Instead of leaning on my own soul, on my own understanding, I am learning to trust fully in Jesus. When I do trust fully (meaning looking only at Jesus + nothing else), instead of a leaky cistern within, there is a bubbling river. When I trust partially, the cistern begins to leak and I am empty. This is so well captured by the song "On Christ the solid rock I stand" in the line that says: "When all around my soul gives way, he then is all my hope and stay". That empty cistern, that soul, was never meant to be our rock. It is meant to drink deeply and be enlivened by the waters of life that flow from our true rock, Christ.</article>

But, ah, the waters failed;
We try to enjoy the pleasures and the things of this world and the prestige and power and the possession of the world and we discover that It doesn’t satisfy. If we cling to the waters that the world provide, we discover that they fail every time. Come to Him, the Lord Jesus Christ.</article>

Brings back memories of Sunday School days and is of enormous encouragement in a sinful world.</article>

We need to turn 180 degrees and look upon into our Lord Saviour Jesus Christ, as our all-inclusive One, His dispensing into us as His vessels of mercy shall be for His increase, and will last for eternity....</article>
