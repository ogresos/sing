"Dear Lord, bring many other little ones to hear this song and lead them to know what it is to be 'proper'. Furthermore, what it means to have such a friend in Jesus! Praise You dear Lord for being such a friend to us".</article>

It is a reminder to us not only to the children that we need an ear to hear so we can obey, a heart that is simple and forgiving. May the Lord gain more children for His economy.</article>

As well of course the old time gospel.</article>
