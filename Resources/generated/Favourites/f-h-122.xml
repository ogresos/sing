He met death and vanquished the power of death forever and now He holds death's key. Most clearly seen in stanza 3 is that through His death a "living throng" was brought forth. This "living throng" is the church brought forth in Christ's resurrection. May He be Chief to us all when we declare His death on the Lord's Day enjoying His pneumatic presence in resurrection.</article>
