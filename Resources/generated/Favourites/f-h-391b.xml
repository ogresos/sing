Guide me, O thou great Jehovah, 
Pilgrim through this barren land; 
I am weak, but thou art mighty; 
Hold me with thy powerful hand; 
Bread of heaven, bread of heaven, 
Feed me till I want no more.

Open now the crystal fountain, 
Whence the healing stream doth flow; 
Let the fire and cloudy pillar 
Lead me all my journey through; 
Strong Deliv'rer, strong Deliv'rer, 
Be thou still my strength and shield

When I tread the verge of Jordan 
Bid my anxious fears subside; 
Death of death, and hell's destruction, 
Land me safe on Canaan's side; 
Songs of praises, songs of praises, 
I will ever give to thee.

Musing on my habitation, 
Musing on my heaven'ly home, 
Fills my soul with holy longings: 
Come, my Jesus, quickly come; 
Vanity is all I see; 
Lord, I long to be with Thee!</article>
