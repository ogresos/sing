Yet they struggle with the anti believers. The atheist have their grasp on the world and even Christianʻs education. Christianʻs main Spirit that is a must is BELIEF. It is how we get to heaven, and get reconciled to GOD. How is it we let these people rob Godʻs fold. We want to save that one atheist. Yet he is robbing peopleʻs attention to no effect. He has nothing to live for, no heaven, no purpose. His leader is that of confusion, so his father is.. Let us return to be children of GOD, and realize these people should keep their hands off of GODʻS people. May this song sing, and the atheist be silenced. AMEN.</article>
