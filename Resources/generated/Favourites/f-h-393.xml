He was one of the more respected and influential leaders of the revolt against the established state church of Scotland and associated himself with the Free Church Movement. He was a noted evangelical preacher and author as well as a hymn writer. One of his tracts, "Believe and Live," reached a circulation of 1 million copies and was a favorite with Queen Victoria. He began to write hymns to inspire the young people out of their complacency. Up until this time the Scottish Presbyterian Church only sang psalms. He wrote more than 600 hymns of which 100 are still in common use. His hymns cover a wide spectrum including truth, praise, service, consecration, and experience. Bonar lived a life of service, suffering and humility. He bore the loss of 5 children. He desired the Lord to be exalted, and he requested that no biography be written about him. - Songs of the Spirit by Martin

There is an additional stanza following stanza #3 above:
The kingdom that I seek
 is Thine; so let the way
 that leads to it be Thine,
 else I must surely stray.</article>
    <article author="Steve Miller" email="" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="5" day="26" year="2009">This hymn is sweetly comforting. It reminds me that everything I pass through, great or small, is ordered by the Father's hand, and I wouldn't have it any other way. It reminds me of Psalm 16:6 "The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places, a goodly heritage."</article>
