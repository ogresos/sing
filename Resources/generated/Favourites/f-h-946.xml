And this One will rule for all to see."

It is not the seemingly comfortable times that we joy in, Lord live out your life within us to joy in the face of persecution, rejection and mistreatment because we have you within our being. Praise you you are able to stand the test. You O Lord will rule for all to see. Lord Jesus we say we love You Lord. Amen. Lord increase Yourself within our being today and in all saints the world over. Amen.</article>

Daily I live in oneness with Him, fighting and claiming the victory from the enemy! Moving on with His sovereign reign, and Christ be magnified in me, His kingdom be manifested on earth!

The tune applied to this hymn matches the seriousness of the words. You know we really have to pay a price. Our gaining Christ so that His Kingdom will be manifested in us is not easy or cheap. You have to really go through a lot to gain the true strength of His life. So count it all joy when you face persecution, rejection and mistreatment because you have within you Someone who can stand the test. And this One will rule for all to see.</article>
