    <article author="Matt" city="LB" provst="CA" country="" month="4" day="6" year="2010">When Christ was the Son of God before His incarnation, He had no human nature. After His resurrection He is the Son of God with humanity Uplifted, Sanctified, and Transformed out of resurrection. He is now both of humanity and divinity. He is both the seed of David and the Son of GOd. He is a wonderful person! (Life-study of Romans, pp. 19-20)</article>
