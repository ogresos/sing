	<article author="William Jeng" email="willjeng@gmail.com" city="Irvine" provst="CA" country="United States" month="1" day="17" year="2016">I enjoyed seeing that our Christian life is a life and goes from level to level, from strength to strength, little by little. Don't be discouraged for where you are in life! It is not an instant transformation - we will not become overcomers overnight. We have seen something of the Lord, and we will get there! The Lord will gain His House, His Dwelling Place! It is our destiny to go on enjoying Christ by living ordinary days in His divine dispensing, from glory to glory!</article>

It is our destiny in Christ to be satisfied with ordinary days, and I wouldn't have it any other way :) The Lord's not looking for spiritual giants in the church life but simply normal functioning Christians that faithfully love Him, little by little, morning by morning, from strength to strength, grace upon grace! Hallelujah!</article>
