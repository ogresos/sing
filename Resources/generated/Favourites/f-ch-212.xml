If we read this hymn thoughtfully, we can see that the revival we are speaking of is not the shallow revival of which most of today's Christianity speaks, much less is it a revival of excitement referred to by the Christians in China. The second half of the third stanza of hymn #212 says, "Burn out filthiness, / Burn up common things, / Making man correspond to God, / Holy without blemish." The revival we are speaking of causes man to correspond to God by making man holy and without blemish. The second half of the fourth stanza says, "Divinity mingled with humanity, / Man's spirit joined with God's Spirit, / Causing God's life / To be manifested in man." This is the revival that we are referring to, and I believe this is also the revival that God desires. It is not an outward, so-called revival work, much less a revival of excitement; rather, it is "divinity mingled with humanity, / Man's spirit joined with God's Spirit, / Causing God's life / To be manifested in man."

    <article author="Hymnal.Net" month="3" day="27" year="2008">Hymns, #212 in the Chinese hymnal was written based on the spiritual vision in Ezekiel 1 concerning four thingsâ€”the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum. If you read The Visions of Ezekiel, you will understand the meaning of this hymn.
