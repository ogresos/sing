Today I was reminded once again how much I need to go back to Him day after day. Our God is the only worthy one. Lord Jesus, You're lovely!</article>

	<article author="madelene Camacam" email="" city="santiago City" provst="Isabela" country="Philippines" month="8" day="14" year="2009">My husband and I sang this hymn in our wedding meeting (1998) as our consecration before the Lord. This really preserves us in  our service to the Lord and to the church because this hymn reminds us always that nothing on earth compares to Him, and we should not desire anything other than Him. In our eleven years of marriage life this has been our longing and prayer "May all our days be Yours Lord, our heart be given to love you, to treasure and to serve You, by Your sufficient grace". What a blessing to serve the Lord...What a glorious church life we have when we abide in Him!!!</article>

	<article author="frinny" email="" city="singapore" provst="singapore" country="Singapore" month="5" day="25" year="2009">This hymn touches me very much. These few days a sister came to visit me to ask me whether I know about this hymn. That reminded me again, this hymn touched me before. When she went back home, I found this song here, sang it again... tears drop. Oh Lord Jesus You're lovely. When I behold You Jesus, You draw my heart completely. I cannot turn away Lord, I rest in Your embrace; And time is gone there's only Your holy, matchless presence
Abiding in You, gazing Upon Your glorious face.
Look at myself is so full of weakness. I can't do anything, oh Lord. May all my days be Yours, Lord,
My heart be given to love You, to treasure and to serve You by Your sufficient grace. Lord I need You!</article>
