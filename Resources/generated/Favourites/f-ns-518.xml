Peter, are you so sure? What a bold, presumptuous thing to tell your Lord! Of course He "knows", but do you?
This is why He had to ask you three times. He knows your love toward Him, but in His asking, you are grieved the third time. Perhaps as a gentle reminder of the love you claimed to have that will follow Him to the end. But now you realise that it is natural, unreliable; so much so that the issue was denial! 
Your natural confidence in your love toward the Lord must be dealt with by this failure; yet you may have been disappointed and have given up.
The Lord came to restore your love toward Him, to charge you with the shepherding of His church, and to prepare you for your martyrdom so that you would not follow Him with any confidence in your natural strength.
So Peter, I ask you,
Do you love Me?</article>

But as soon as the morning broke, the Lord appeared to them on the shore, and immediately they caught many fish, to the point that they actually couldn't even haul it in anymore due to the abundance of fish! Once they dragged the net of fish to shore, the Lord made them breakfast, then asked Peter 3 times, "Simon, son of John, do you love Me?" Peter responded "yes" every single time, and the Lord simply answered with "Feed my lambs", "Shepherd my sheep", and "Feed my sheep" all three times. 

The Lord is so sweet to Peter. He made him breakfast, then asked him to feed the others. Before we serve the Lord, He wants us to simply enjoy Him first before anything else. Christ shepherded us, so that we can shepherd others. He is our big brother and our pattern. Lord, teach me how to serve You. I don't really know how to.. but you know that I love You. I will shepherd Your sheep.

The Lord touched me with this song very much. I love singing this song to the Lord every morning. He is so sweet to me.</article>
