	<article author="Betty Jane Bonn" email="" city="Dunlap" provst="Illinois" country="United States" month="7" day="9" year="2012">Lately, in my prayers for someone's soul, I have been using Leviticus 17:11: 
"For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul."
This Old Testament type is, of course, a foreshadowing of the precious blood of Jesus. I Peter 1:18a, 19, 20 says:
"Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold...But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot: Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you."
There truly is Power in the Blood of the Lamb to save the human soul! Thank You, dear Lord Jesus!</article>
