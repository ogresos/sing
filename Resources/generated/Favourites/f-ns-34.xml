Life’s still unwritten letter.

He sees which turn is better;
At the right time
He’ll open up your eyes!</article>

	<article author="Mj" email="" city="Tuguegarao" provst="Cagayan" country="Philippines" month="2" day="6" year="2011">We fear of many things because we are not absolute to the Lord. If we just give Him the ground to work in every room in our heart, we give Him the preeminence in all things, then we could say to Him, Lord, You know best for me. I just want to trust in You.</article>

	<article author="Gloria Liu" email="" city="Hamilton" provst="" country="New Zealand" month="7" day="16" year="2009">I've really been enjoying this song lately.
Many times, we may be so weak with our situations and may find ourselves wondering where the Lord is when we need Him. But this song just reminds me that the Lord KNOWS EVERYTHING that we are going through and the best way for us to turn to Him. He knows our stubbornness and what will make us turn~ He knows us even better than we know ourselves! Will not the Creator who arranged the WHOLE UNIVERSE be able to arrange even our little situations in the best way for us to turn back to Him?
This song has really strengthened my faith and really comforted me in the times of my trials :) Praise the Lord that He is faithful! (1 Thes. 5:24) and that all things work together for good! (Rom. 8:28)^^</article>
	<article author="Yahosca Martnez" email="" city="Managua" provst="" country="Nicaragua" month="8" day="25" year="2008">I found this song because I was looking for a song that could give force. I received a bad notice... but, when I heard this song...Oh! I just give thank to the Lord, because HE KNOWS!! He knows every part of my life and He has everything so planned!! Even bad times are a way for we can come back to Him, come back to His recovery!!... We dont have to be worry about "what if", He sees which turn is better!! Hallelujah!!</article>
	<article author="Grace Lee" email="" city="Hong Kong" provst="" country="" month="7" day="12" year="2006">In the afternoon, about two o'clock something, I fight with my sister who age smaller than me (just one year), but her body and power are much powerful than me. I found that I was unable to fight against her, and finally lost. I noticed that I might not see Lord's face since I have quarreled between Lord and myself. In this case, I was unable to turn to Lord and confess my sins, but in my spirit's deepest part there is a voice sounded "Fear not, I knows; your life is in my Hands." This is a thought so joyous that what I have to fear? Amen. Hallelujah!</article>
	<article author="Mandy Ang" email="" city="Calgary" provst="AB" country="Canada" month="1" day="15" year="2003">This song is absolutely amazing. Whenever we're in a hard situation, it seems like God's nowhere to be found. He knows our every situation! There's no need for us to worry about anything because God knows and He cares about what happens to us. All we need to do is seek Christ in every situation, so that we can experience Him! Don't worry about your problems - Christ will take care of it - as long as you seek Christ!</article>
