    <article author="Hymnal.Net" month="3" day="28" year="2008">In the church life, whether in the brothers' houses or the sisters' houses, if we live by the divine and resurrected life, this life will put to death our natural affection. In this way, we will have the same love toward all the brothers and sisters and will not be close to some and distant from others. If we daily die to our self, to our natural affection and opinions, the power of the resurrection life within will operate, and the divine life and nature will be manifested from within us. As elders, co-workers, and brothers or sisters, when we come among the saints, the first thing we need to do is to die to ourselves, not having our own choice, taste, or desire. Only then will the power of the resurrection life be able to operate within us, and only then will the resurrection life be able to be dispensed into others through us. This was the life that the Lord lived on the earth: dying to the self and living out the Father's life. Today, if we believers are to live Him and follow Him, we need to have the same kind of living.

    <article author="Hymnal.Net" month="3" day="28" year="2008">The various kinds of situations and circumstances in our daily life are all for us to know the power of Christ's resurrection. We are not trying to be a Christian. Rather, we are living out a Christian life. To be a Christian is not a matter of trying, but a matter of living. Trying depends on human effort; living depends on resurrection. Hymns, #362 says, "He died for me that I might live," and "He lives for me that I may live." The Lord did not only die for me, but He also lives for me so that I can live. Instead of trying by myself, I am living by Him.

    <article author="Hymnal.Net" month="3" day="26" year="2008">If we have seen that spiritual reality is Christ Himself, when we go out to visit the saints, to shepherd the saints, or to teach the saints, we will hold on firmly to the principle that we are ministering Christ to them. This is not merely to comfort them in their suffering but to transmit and supply Christ into them through fellowship. For this reason, we need to gain and experience more of Christ, because if we have not received the supply from Christ, it will be difficult for us to supply others, and if we have not experienced Christ, it will be difficult for us to nourish others. There is a hymn which says, "He lives for me that I may give / His love to hearts that pine" (Hymns, #362). May we all be this kind of people, giving His love to the hearts that pine.
