	<article author="Jason Au" email="" city="Toronto" provst="ON" country="Canada" month="9" day="22" year="2003">Right now, I'm feeling hard times, and I really need the lord. This song is really soothing and reminds me that Jesus can be our friend.

He can be the One who cares for us, One who we can share the burden of life with. The new tune has a nice ring to it, but when I get into the lyrics, it just touches the heart on how Jesus can really be personal. One that we can everything too. Whether in good times or bad.</article>
