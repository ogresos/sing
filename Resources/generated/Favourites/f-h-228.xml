Nearly the whole town of Tra­lee be­longed to him. He had an op­por­tun­i­ty twen­ty years ago, when his leas­es fell in, of rais­ing his rents to fig­ures that, in some cas­es, would not have been con­sid­ered ex­tor­tion­ate had they been quad­ru­pled. He, how­ev­er, de­cid­ed to ac­cept the old rents. The re­sult was that he was al­most alone in es­cap­ing any re­duct­ion in the hands of the Land Com­miss­ion. So far as he was him­self con­cerned, a lit­tle mon­ey went a long way, but he gave lib­er­al­ly to poor rela­tions and to the de­vel­op­ment of re­li­gious work in con­nect­ion with the “Brethren.” Liv­ing in a qui­et way in a cot­tage in Is­ling­ton, he de­vot­ed his time to the stu­dy of the pro­phet­ic books. His rent­al in­come from Ire­land was about £13,000 a year. - Leeds Mercury (newspaper), June 19, 1889</article>

It's not just partaking the bread and wine, it's the sweet feast of love divine! How intimate and how glorious to be in the Lord's Table! Amen.</article>
