3. Weary of selfishness and pride,
False pleasures gone, vain hopes denied,
Deep in Thy wounds my shame to hide,
Christ crucified, I come.

4. Thou knowest all my griefs and fears,
Thy grace abused, my misspent years;
Yet now to Thee, for cleansing tears,
Christ crucified, I come.

These two verses have really been my experience. I was raised in the Lord's recovery but still, after I was saved abused the Lord's grace and mispent a lot of time. Then I began to get weary of living in the world and just started to say "Christ crucified, I come!" This turning to Him has been the most enjoyable time of my life. I am the happiest I have ever been. The Lord just keeps working in me. I always enjoy the ministry and all of the new songs that are posted on this website. Praise the Lord! His work on the earth is moving!</article>
