It is not enough to just know the blood of Jesus. We need to know the precious, substituting, efficacious, covenanting, cleansing, purging, separating, preserving, propitiating, redeeming, reconciling, defending, overcoming, covering blood. Truly, as stanza 7 says, we will need eternity to declare its boundless good.</article>
