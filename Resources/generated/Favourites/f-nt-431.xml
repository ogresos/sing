This is my prayer for the rest of my life; Lord, don't let me go. Constrain my whole being with Yourself. I love my master and I will not go out free. Give me the willingness to be trained and equipped, to hold a feast unto You to serve You. Lord my future is for You. Lord don't let me go!</article>

Clear every avenue of thought and brain
Flood my affections purify my will
Let nothing but thine own pure life remain
Amen.</article>

	<article author="Resell Quidet" email="" city="Vienna" provst="" country="Austria" month="10" day="28" year="2007">I really missed the days mingling with all the believers. When I heard this song it's really remembered the days when I attend the young people's meeting, home meeting and other meeting I attended in philippines last 5 years ago. I really forgot the lyrics. So please post it here..btw, I was touched the message of our brother David Li..it is very refreshing! Hallelujah! Even though we're apart but we are one in His Body. Amen!</article>
	<article author="Ariel" email="" city="Stony Brook" provst="NY" country="U.S.A." month="2" day="21" year="2007">I love this song because it reaches deep into my soul and washes like a wave of forgiveness over me. God truly is wholly mastering me. The intermingling chords along with the lyrics tells me of the glories of God, the wonders of His name, and makes me yearn for a deeper understanding of Him. When listening or singing this song, I feel that all should take a moment of silence afterwards, or a Selah, to fully enjoy the prescence of God. Amen, Hallelujah!</article>
	<article author="David Li" email="" city="Irving" provst="TX" country="U.S.A." month="11" day="20" year="2006">The past is usually a pretty bad and grotesque thing to look back upon. If it is not right now, then it should be forgotten. A lot of people have experienced this. We believe in Christ, and we need to just terminate the past and our past life. It is just full of sins, regrets, and many other horrible things.
If we don't forget the past then we will be stuck in it. I know a lot of people who knew people like this. They were always stuck in themselves. "People who dwell in the past don't know how to live in the present. It is important to let the past go and get on with your life."
Life is only so short. The best way to avoid this is to to start over. If you're in your past your whole life, then you will not have accomplished anything, and this is the only life you will ever get. Enjoy Christ, preach the gospel, exercise your spirit, go to the meetings, and do many other things in this life. Get out of your dark past, and get on with your life.
Christ will come one day, you will have to show Him the people you saved and what you've accomplished in your life. He knows if you're an overcomer or not right now. Life's too short to waste a single day, so use every single day, especially if you're a teenager, which I am right now. After your teenage years, it will be too late.
Witness Lee once said that the teenage years are the golden years of a human being's life. If you want to do something, do it now! Watchman treated every week as a year! He set a goal to read the New Testament 52 times in a year! We should not only not live in the past, but also live in the future by extending every day.
Praise the Lord for this wonderful salvation and the grace and mercy He gave us. I hope you will all see this. Hallelujah for this wonderful vision!
We just need to let the Lord bind and lead us His way our whole lives! Amen!</article>
