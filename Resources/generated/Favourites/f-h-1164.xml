Teach us to labor constantly upon this vast reality. Oh how we need these genuine daily experiences of Christ as the good land for You to have your purpose—Your built up dwelling place on earth!</article>

During Abrham's time, the land is a place where Abraham couls defeat all his enemies that God might have a kingdom on earth. Today, our land is Christ, so vast, immense and extensive...so we can live in and live on, then we can defeat our own enemies...the vicious and destructive self! Hallelujah for thisi Chist...the Land!</article>

Oh, Christ my life supply! Oh, Christ my life!</article>
