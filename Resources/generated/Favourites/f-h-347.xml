It is very wonderful for me to know that all my sins have been washed by the blood of Jesus Christ. This is the greatest gift I can think of. This hymn was playing in my mind this morning. This was an answer to prayer, because last week was a difficult one at work. I thank God that in about 55 years time (May be sooner) all that will be on my mind is to praise Him and glorify Him forever.</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="1" day="3" year="2014">Philip Doddridge was the youngest of 20 children! He was considered too sickly to live. His parents died when he was only a teenager, but he was taken in by a minister who nurtured him in spiritual matters. Doddridge became a pastor, an educator, a hymnwriter, and an author. He wrote his hymns to illustrate his sermons and taught them to his congregation after he finished preaching.
---------------------------
The original last line of stanza #2 above says:
Charmed to confess the voice divine.
----------------------------------
There is an additional stanza following stanza #1:
O happy bond, that seals my vows
 To Him Who merits all my love!
 Let cheerful anthems fill His house,
 While to that sacred shrine I move.</article>

	<article author="Joan" email="" city="Orangeville" provst="Ontario" country="Canada" month="11" day="12" year="2012">I never grew up with my father. Now I do understand what it means to have a father as God has been the utmost Father to me. He made provision for my sins to be erased long before I was born so that I could be reconciled to Him. Today the song came to my mind and later on in the day a total stranger came up to me and sang it. My heart is no longer divided but at peace, total rest, knowing that I am His and He is mine.</article>
