Let others have everything in the world Lord, l don't need any of those things. I have nothing if I don't have You Lord Jesus. You are my God, my Portion, my Love, my everlasting all. I'll be satisfied just to be with You because in You, I have no lack. 
I love You Lord.</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="2" day="8" year="2013">Isaac Watts was only 5 feet tall, and his big head made his body look even smaller. He had a long, hooked nose. And he was sickly from his teenage years, when smallpox nearly killed Him.
One woman fell in love with his poetry and wanted to marry him. Watts proposed to her, but his physical appearance caused her to reject him. He remained a bachelor all his life.
For his last 36 years he was an invalid, preaching only occasionally as his health would permit. But he wrote hymns continually. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>
	<article author="Billy Miranda" email="" city="" provst="" country="Colombia" month="11" day="29" year="2012">My God, my Portion, my supply, my dwelling place.... My everlasting All.
I really enjoy the second verse, since it is true that our Lord really suplies all our needs, but even so, Our hearts ara not satisfied with all those things, as for they are not God Himself. Only God can satisfy man. nothing compares to Him, nothing can take His place. Nevermind if there's something we lack, it is in Him, where we can be really satisfied.
Thank You Lord, I need nothing, anymore. You are everything! Jesus I really love You.</article>

	<article author="Nikki" email="" city="Austin" provst="" country="United States" month="3" day="27" year="2011">God loves us so much that when we turn away from Him, it breaks His heart to million pieces... Sometimes, despite our varying conditions, there's nothing that pleases God the most when we say, Lord, we love You, despite our condition... Lord, you love us soooo much, Yes, we love You too... we don't like to see You grieve over us... Oh Lord, we love You too... forgive us for sometimes forsaking You... help us to keep turning back to You... through faith in our Christ Jesus, we say... all we wanna do is love You... oh, my God, my Portion and my Love... my everlasting Love... There's nothing like You, my God...</article>

	<article author="Enoch" email="" city="Lexington" provst="Kentucky" country="United States" month="5" day="15" year="2010">When we struggle, sometimes, we just need to remember that there's nothing here that deserves our joys. What's my safety, or my health, or all my friends to me? For there is nothing like our God.

In these tough times, I always reach into my spirit, and remember-
My God,
My Portion,
and my Love,
My everlasting All.</article>
	<article author="B Liu" email="" city="Toronto" provst="Ontario" country="Canada" month="10" day="4" year="2009">Were I possessor of the earth,
 And called the stars my own,
Without Thy graces and Thyself,
 I were a wretch undone.

Oh Lord, You are my God, my Portion, my Love and everlasting All. Only in You, I find rest, satisfaction, joy and enjoyment. All things are vain, only Christ is gain. 

God's goal in His economy is not merely to redeem His people and save them from the world, typified by Egypt, but to bring them into Christ, typified by the good land, so that they may possess Him and enjoy His unsearchable riches. By enjoying His unsearchable riches, we are built up to be His Body, the church, which is Christ fullness, His expression, and which is also the habitation of God and the kingdom of God. And ultimately, this will consummate in the New Jerusalem in eternity for the fulfillment of God's eternal economy.
Amen!!!</article>

You are my GOD and everything.  I love you Lord.</article>
	<article author="Cristina Flores" email="" city="Calgary" provst="AB" country="Canada" month="10" day="7" year="2002">Oh I enjoyed this song so much. In the last verse it says, "let others stretch their arms like seas, and grasp in all the shore." That we should not be like others, to care and want the world. We are peculiar Christians, we are nothing like the rest of the world. I just enjoyed that how we need to desire no more! That the only reason we're here on this earth is for the Lord, this realization became more clear to me this year. We're not here to be a famous athlete, or to watch TV or waste our time on needless things. The Lord did not create us to play sports, He created us for Him. For a purpose. He's OUR GOD!!!! We were made specially by Him. When you have something that you created, even if it starts to crack, it's your own, you treasure it soooo much. This is the same way with the Lord, He created us and treasures us the way we are, sinful men, the Lord loves us regardless and unconditionally. We need to realize that He IS OUR GOD, we may leave Him, but OH LORD JESUS!!! He will never abandon His treasures.</article>
	<article author="Filip S. Syrek" email="" city="Reading" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="9" day="30" year="2002">With much regret I must admit that there not always has been a time where I could say: Lord, You are the only One I desire... There was a time when my heart was not ready to confess it. But as the time went by and I have been drawn by the Lord more and more, slowly, gradually I began to realise the uniqueness and pre-eminence of this all-inclusive Christ. Praise Him! It is not of me but solely because of His work and mercy that now I can say with the deep confidence within: Lord, I love You and there is nothing and no one in the heavens or on the earth that I desire but You... He is the only future of mine. What empty things are all the skies if once compared to Him! There's nothing here deserves my joys. There's nothing like MY GOD!</article>
	<article author="Hymnal.net" city="" provst="" country="" month="2" day="6" year="2013">Since we have been justified, we have entered into another realm—the realm of grace. In this realm of grace our enjoyment is God Himself. Romans 5:11 says, "Boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation." Our boast is not in our reputation, education, home, possessions, or situation, all of which are worthless when compared to God. Our boast is in our God, and our glory is in Him. Recently, my wife and I moved into a new apartment. After everything in it had been arranged, I looked at it and was very pleased. However, as I was admiring it, the Spirit reminded me that these things are worthless compared to God. Then I opened to Hymns, #600: "My God, my Portion, and my Love, / My everlasting All." God is our eternal portion. Outward things may be good in a shallow sense, but they cannot compare with God. We have peace toward God, we are glorying and boasting in Him, and we are enjoying Him.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="27" year="2008">God called Paul and said to him, "I send you, to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith in Me" (Acts 26:17b-18). This inheritance is God as our possession, that is, God as our land with its rich produce. Today man needs land to provide food for his living and a lodging for his rest. As we have seen, Psalm 16:5 says, "Jehovah is the portion of My inheritance," and Psalm 90:1 says, "O Lord, You have been our dwelling place / In all generations." Hymns, #600 is written based on these two psalms. The general idea of the hymn is that God is our eternal portion, our everlasting all, and our safe abode. God is our land and our dwelling place. It is no wonder that when the Lord Jesus came, He said, "Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest" (Matt. 11:28). Moreover, in John 15:4 He said, "Abide in Me." Today all men have lost God as their possession, and they have no real dwelling place. Fallen people are all drifting about and wandering without a home. Although they may live in high-rise buildings or large mansions, within them there is no rest, no dwelling place. Man is wandering because he has lost God. God is man's real dwelling place and real possession.
