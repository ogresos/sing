I felt it will help if we use the tune of Hymn 1276. 
Amen.</article>
	<article author="Sue-Ellen Cox" email="walk.in_gods_grace@yahoo.com" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="7" day="29" year="2014">(For the saints in Africa) Perhaps you could find another tune which would fit and break it up; singing one verse and then another. The words are rich and full and beautiful. Praise to our All-Mighty God! Halleleujah! We love You Lord Jesus!!!</article>
	<article author="Kitty Joubert" email="kitty@kiepersolacc.co.za" city="Bloemfontein" provst="Free State" country="South Africa" month="2" day="15" year="2013">Isn't it a little bit confusing for young people to sing? We wanted to enjoy the song, but the music is just ONE verse long and the words very difficult to understand for youngsters. The words are rich and full. Please arrange it so that the young ones can go on and on singing for the 26 verses?</article>
	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="4" day="28" year="2008">Hymns, #187 has twenty-six stanzas that speak of the fullness in the Lord Jesus. When we read through this hymn, we sense the fullness of the Lord Jesus. Whatever we need He is; He is neither poor nor empty. The Lord Jesus possesses life, but He does not merely have a great measure of life; He has the fullness of life like a waterfall. He does not merely have love; He has the fullness of love. John 3:16 says, "God so loved the world." However, the verse does not end here; it continues: "That He gave His only begotten Son." The words so and that show that the love which was in God entered into the Son. The love of God was rich in God. When the love of God entered into the Son, it became the fullness of love. The love of God with which He loves the world is rich, but when the only begotten Son came, God's love became the fullness. When we receive God's love, we are receiving what is in the Son, not what is in the Father. Hence, the love we receive is the fullness of love.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="26" year="2008">Hymns, #187 has twenty-six stanzas which speak of all the items of Christ as our enjoyment in the Gospel of John. The twenty-one chapters of the Gospel of John are full of the riches of Christ for our enjoyment. Christ is the tabernacle (1:14), the Lamb (v. 29), the ladder (v. 51), the living water (4:14), the bread of life (6:35), the light (8:12), the way, the reality, the life (14:6), the door (10:9), and the Shepherd (v. 11). One of the first items of Christ in John is that Christ came as the Lamb. This was the first testimony given to Him by John the Baptist who said, "Behold, the Lamb of God" (John 1:29). Eventually, John testified in the book of Revelation that this One will be the Lamb of God on the throne for eternity (Rev. 22:1). The Lamb is the opener for us to enter into the enjoyment of God. If fallen man wants to enjoy God, he needs to pass through the entrance of redemption. He needs the redeeming Lamb as the entrance into the enjoyment of God.

In John the Lord tells us that He is the great I Am. The Lord referred to Himself in this way three times in John 8. In verse 24 He said, "Unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins." In verse 28 He said, "When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am." Finally, in verse 58 He said, "Before Abraham came into being, I am." As the great I Am, He is what we need. It is as if the Lord were saying, "I am what you need." We can fill in the blank after the phrase I am for whatever we need. The Lord says, "I am the light, I am the way, I am the life, I am the truth, I am the door, I am the Shepherd, I am the ladder, I am the bread of life, I am the living water, etc." The Gospel of John reveals the wonderful fact that Christ is the great I Am. This means that He is everything to us for our enjoyment. The message of the Gospel of John is that God in Christ through the Holy Spirit is our enjoyment.
