    <article author="crizalde m. las" city="philippines" provst="manila" country="Philippines" month="11" day="1" year="2008">Romans chapter 6 says, shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? certainly not, how shall we who died to sin, live any longer in it. Or do you not know, that he who dies in Christ, crucified with him. Therefore we were buried with him, through the baptism of dead. And as Christ was risen from the dead by the glory of the Father, we also shall walk in the newness of life. For our old man was crucified with him, that the body of sin may be done away with, that we should no longer slaves of sin. For he who die, has been freed from sin. And if we died in Christ, we believe we also shall live with him. Knowing that Christ having been raised from the dead, dies no more, death no longer has dominion over him. For the death the he dies, he dies to sin, and the life that he lives, he lives to God. Amen, Amen, Amen.</article>
