Querido y cerca a mí;
Más cada día a mi;
Su persona dentro en mí
Se hace realidad,
Esperanza y fe me da
Al salvarme y amar.
Mi todo en todo Tu,
Eres Señor!
Si esperanza no hay, 
Y corta es mi fe,
Oigo su voz decir,
"Confía y veras
Yo todo supliré
Si solo tú me crees.
Toda duda se irá 
Confiando en Mí!"</article>

날마다 가까이
날마다 가까이
내게더 사랑스럽게
내안에 계신주 내실재가 되시내.
날구원해 사랑해
믿음과 희망을 주내.
당신은 모든것 내 주예수.
믿음이 작을 때
희망이 없을 때
주 말씀하시네
날믿으면 알리라
너의 온 필요를
넘치게 공급함을
걱정이 없다내 주 믿는동안</article>

	<article author="Dora Nineth Yao" email="" city="Long Island" provst="NY" country="United States" month="11" day="4" year="2008">The Lord has brought me once again to this song. I recently went to a conference and the speaking was so high yet I feel so low, so disappointed, even faithless, so short of what the Lord is looking for. How can I possibly make it? The Lord reminds me today - "even when faith is small, when there is no hope at all... trust in Me and you'll see! that I'll supply all your needs, if only you will believe, all anxious doubts will cease, while trusting Me." What a salvation to hear this little song. Hallelujah! The Lord is not after an army of spiritual giants but He's after the ones who seek His purpose, who long to be overcomers, living a normal Christian life.</article>
