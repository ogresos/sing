   Keep me safe. Keep me close to Thee.
Let me see Your Love in each and every I meet this day.
Dear God keep me near to Thee in the midst of life's storms
The sunshine is always behind the cloudy day
Though the darkness hides my shame
I feel courage in Thy Holy name.</article>

	<article author="Rosita Enriquez" email="" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="5" day="28" year="2012">The Lord must gain His Bride but for this to happen He first must gain His Body. Brother Ron Kangas in the last message of the Memorial Day Feast in Bellevue, WA. encouraged us to pray "LORD GIVE ME TODAY'S GROWTH, GROW IN ME SO YOU CAN HAVE THE BUILT UP BODY OF CHRIST"

In the first stanza of this song Brother Higashi prays "Grant me, Lord, to be filled with You, Lord, every day. Dearest Lord, take me all the way." This is related to another prayer Brother Ron gave us "Cause me to reach maturity in life before I finish my course."
Lord give us today our daily growth, to match You, to become the Body, and for You to gain Your Bride, Beloved Bridegroom.</article>

	<article author="Eunice" email="" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="8" day="2" year="2011">Divine romance... I really appreciate this song. My consideration is on the one hand the Lord desires to come again to gain His Bride of peerless worth and on the other hand the church, His Bride needs to cooperate with Him in His yearning. This song was composed in such a way... Firstly, taking care of the Lord's interest in relation to His coming again and secondly, taking care of our heart. "To be filled" and "taken all the way". Not to "stray" but "be faithful all the way". Allowing Him to make His home in all our heart. Praying desperately to be saturated and soaked with Him every hour, expecting Him. Being willing to pay the price what ever it may be. And in His love pour our all on Him. "And the church, Your Bride to be, this my choice voluntarily." Amen Lord Jesus. We just look away from all other things unto YOU! Your great love has captured our hearts. We love You back. And may our love toward you and the saints grow till it eventually ushers in Your return! We love You dear lovely Bridegroom... Make this our reality daily... Amen Lord Jesus, come!</article>

The principle is we need to be matured before the Lord will come so that we will reign with Him in the millennial kingdom. We are His bride and He washes our wrinkles and spots so that we will be glorious in the wedding feast... Oh! COME LORD JESUS!
we are waiting for Your second coming!
Saints let us prepare! Amen! because of His love for us He will come to stay with us and in us eternally...mutual abode!!! Hallelujah!</article>
	<article author="Alvin Lo" email="" city="Hong Kong" provst="" country="Hong Kong" month="9" day="26" year="2008">One day right after I woke up, the Lord gave me this hymn, and I fell into tears at once. I realized I have not been thinking about the Lord's return in my life. I only cared for myself. I need to repent to the Lord for not yearning for His return!
Oh Lord Jesus, saturate me with You, and make home in my heart, all my deepest parts! Grant me a heart that always love You, and a mind that always think about You. I yearn for Your return!</article>
	<article author="Betty Co" email="" city="" provst="IL" country="United States" month="7" day="11" year="2008">Oh Lord, don't let me stray,

Lord, may I treasure You more today and faithfully await Your coming. I pray that my inward being would be One with You.</article>
	<article author="mercy bumohya" email="" city="dubai" provst="" country="United Arab Emirates" month="7" day="6" year="2008">Amen..come dear Bridegroom. Every time I listen to this song I come to realize that in everything we do, it must be to hasten the Lord's coming. We should not be the reason to delay the coming of our dearest Bridegroom. Oh Lord Jesus, I hope there will be a meeting here in UAE. Lord, I want to be mingled with Your chosen people as a part of Body.</article>
	<article author="Bridge" email="" city="Marianas" provst="" country="" month="12" day="26" year="2006">I confess my love to the Lord. I think it's easy to love the Lord. I also admit that I don't have the desperate prayer to be watchful for our dear Bridegoom's return. This song reassures me that I need not be reluctant to let the Lord come in to the rooms deep within me that needs cleaning. Tonight I am touched by the Lord's dear trusting presence. He is ever gentle and caring...loving us with His very Being. Like a child, I really can only trust HIM. Even if I try, He knows that only He is able!! So now I pray, "Lord, have all the ground to accomplish your work in me. Come even into all the rooms that I do not know are even there! Lord I love You! And come Lord Jesus!</article>
	<article author="Helen" email="" city="" provst="" country="Canada" month="1" day="21" year="2006">I fear that I am not yet prepared for the Lord to come back again. Yet I can no longer grieve the Lord but hope for His return. Now the Lord's interest &amp; desire is all I'm longing for. Saints let's all choose to pay the price for Him to be our destiny. That we may all hasten His coming and say "Amen. Come Lord Jesus."</article>
	<article author="Rebacca" email="" city="" provst="" country="Malaysia" month="9" day="13" year="2005">This hymn is a nice hymn and it makes me turn to the Lord when I listen to it! O Lord Jesus, please come to my heart. Make home in all my heart. Amen!</article>
	<article author="Eunice Garcia" email="" city="" provst="New York" country="U.S.A." month="8" day="31" year="2005">O Lord Jesus! Recently I have been so stirred up for the Lord's second coming, in fact nothing really seemed to matter but our Lord's return. (Of course we still have to "brush our teeth")

Going to the summer video training on I &amp; II Thess. and Song of Songs, serving for the summer school of truth, and my daily bible reading has impressed with the this matter of the Lord coming again a second time. In fact my prayer and my aim is to live in light of the Lord's coming. Oh dear Saint's, we really have to check ourselves. Remember why we are here and what God has called us into. "But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people acquired for a possesion, so that you may tell out the virtues of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light (I Peter 2:9."

Even though our God is Almighty, He has limited Himself to us. Oh saints, let's give ourselves to Him out of love for His purpose. When I say this, I speak to myself too. So let's be encouraged. May we be the generation to bring Him back! "Come Lord Jesus, Please come dear Bridegroom....."</article>
	<article author="Rene Vreeken" email="" city="Adelaide/Metcalfe" provst="ON" country="Canada" month="10" day="4" year="2002">As I grew up, church matters were only for Sunday. God and the church were not to be discussed throughout the week. However, after entering into the Lord's recovery, I came to realize that Christ is with us everyday!

The first time I heard and sang this song, my spirit cried out in the questions and calling of this song: Come Lord Jesus! Oh how my spirit yearns for the Lord's return!

We have to realize that for the Lord to return, He must have His purpose completed here on earth, and we have to be those who cooperate with Him in this matter. This song gives me the initiative and the desire to go on in the Lord's recovery. I want to be one of His overcomers who will see this song come to completion!</article>
