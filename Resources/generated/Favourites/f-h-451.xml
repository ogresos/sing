It wasn't clear to me what the wrestling meant until I read your comment! Praise the Lord that we can help each other come closer to our Lord by sharing our insights and our love for Him.</article>
    <article author="Isaiah Tor" city="Sydney" provst="NSW" country="Australia" month="9" day="22" year="2008">The writer of this hymn portrays oneness with Christ in terms of deep spiritual intimacy and dependence on Him in every single way. To "wrestle" here implies the energies of the flesh, as opposed to those of the mingled spirit. To "lean" is to resign all our efforts and resources to take Him as everything to us. Surely this requires us to yield to Him completely. But for this to happen we need to die to self, and have our natural energy, the strongest part of our natural being, made fundamentally "lame" so that we with our Jacobite nature may become the transformed and matured Israel where our very being so gained and saturated by the Lord is "victory".</article>
