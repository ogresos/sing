	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="3" day="28" year="2014">Jane Catharine Lundie wrote this hymn in 1843. She married famed Scottish preacher and hymn writer Horatius Bonar that same year. Though he was thirteen years her senior, they had a loving marriage, and fruitful ministry together for over four decades. She wrote other hymns, but Mrs. Bonar is chiefly remembered for this one, originally entitled “Jesus, All in All.” 
Many years ago, when a young pastor lay dying, he urged those gathered around his bed not to weep for him, but rather to sing a hymn. And this was the hymn he asked for. As he passed into eternity, and into the presence of his Saviour, the hymn was sung (though tearfully). - Wordwise Hymns - Robert Cottrill</article>

	<article author="S.ktorides" email="" city="London" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="5" day="22" year="2012">This song etches more than ever the story of my life after years of bearing the cross after Him who loved me and died for me and now lives evermore. It expresses everything the weather-beaten soul has to say. And when my exit from this world comes, whether caught up alive to meet Jesus in the clouds or whether by deperture from this mortal body I want to leave singing this song. Jesus alone can bless, Jesus has satisfied.</article>
