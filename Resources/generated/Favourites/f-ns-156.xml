He is the one who makes me glad, He is the one who defends, and vindicates. He is a person to be experienced, not a concept to apply. He is the One True God, the only worthy of being called Lord, the great Counselor and Father whom we call Poppa, our sweet protector and guide. He is above all, the self-existing One, the Name above all names, He puts His enemies beneath Him and His friends in the heavenlies, He is the Most High God and there is no other. To Him be the glory and the Power, forever and ever.</article>

	<article author="Fisherman's Daughter" email="" city="Dana Point" provst="Ca" country="Iceland" month="4" day="7" year="2011">He is my Creator and He's the only one that knows me and love me the most. In sadness and in joy, Him I love and give praises. He hears my cry at night and comfort me and protect me. The painful tears I cry, the sweeter His love for me... to Thee I give my love and life.</article>
	<article author="Rita" email="" city="Kampala" provst="" country="Uganda" month="9" day="27" year="2010">This is one of the sweetest songs...Lord whom have I, in heaven but You?

	<article author="Alicia" email="" city="Bath" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="8" day="7" year="2009">Today I read Philippians ch. 3, and I really appreciate Paul's pattern. He loves the Lord Jesus, on aacount of whom he has suffered the loss of all things. Sometimes our experience just stops here, and we will painful when we are deprived of what we desire. But for Paul, on account this most precious and lovly person in the whole universe, he not only suffered the loss AND count them as refuse so that he may gain Christ!
To be honest, sometimes there are still many things in the world that are very attractive to us. But everything that prevents us from gaining Christ is really refuse.  
Lord, I love You. Nothing on this earth can compare to You. :)</article>

	<article author="Rosita Enriquez" email="" city="Anaheim" provst="CA" country="U.S.A." month="4" day="13" year="2007">I like this song because it declares my love to The Lord. May we desire Him more and more. Without Him, what else there is!? NOTHING, O may we love Him more and more everyday and may we declare it to Him!!!!!! JESUS WE LOVE YOU, WE DESIRE YOU, YOU HAVE CONQUERED OUR HEARTS, WE CAN'T LET GO OF YOU, "LORD JESUS, I JUST LOVE YOU, I LOVE ONLY YOU"
Heb. 12:2 "Looking away unto Jesus..." and footnote "The wonderful Jesus, who is enthroned in heaven and crowned with glory and honor (2:9), is the greatest attraction in the universe. He is like an immense magnet, drawing all His seekers to Him. It is by being attracted by His charming beauty that we look away from all things other than Him. Without such a charming object, how could we look away from so many distracting things on this earth?" O LORD, DRAW US, WE WILL RUN AFTER YOU, RAISE A GENERATION OF "CRAZY LOVERS OF JESUS"</article>

Aún en medio de tribulación podemos experimentar a Cristo como un bálsamo todo inclusivo si abrimos nuestra boca y se lo decimos. Este himno en particular me ha ayudado a hacerlo y me ha traído a una experiencia muy personal y subjetiva con el Señor.</article>
	<article author="Henny Pangestu" email="" city="" provst="" country="Indonesia" month="1" day="28" year="2007">I love the tune. It's simple so I can easily remember and the lyrics also simple just to say and to express how we love the Lord.</article>

Too many times I wander in my mind and are attracted to other things in the world. Praise the Lord that He has loved us first. The Lord simply wants to gain our heart and for us to love Him as our first love. Oh Lord, how I long to love you more and more each day!</article>
	<article author="Mary Yong" email="" city="Penang" provst="" country="Malaysia" month="9" day="14" year="2006">Recently I'm aroused with worries &amp; started to ponder over my future &amp; prospects, but when I sang this hymn, I'm exposed to see that I should desire Him above all these &amp; give Him unreservedly my future &amp; my all.</article>
