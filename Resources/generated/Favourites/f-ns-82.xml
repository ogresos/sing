But GOD being so merciful... But that’s not all! I’m with the SAINTS!... Now in Christ He has become my PEACE; By the blood of Christ I am RELEASED... With all saints together, let us stand, SHOUT and SING and PRAISE the LORD! HALLELUJAH!!!</article>

I enjoyed the last stanza:

He has died creating one new man.
Thus fulfilling God's eternal plan. 
With all saints together let us stand, 
Shout and sing and praise the Lord!</article>
