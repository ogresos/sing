	<article author="Steven Miller" email="smille10@sbcglobal.net" city="Detroit" provst="Michigan" country="United States" month="7" day="2" year="2016">"It was on November 2, 1850, that I was gloriously converted while the congregation sang the grand old consecration hymn of Isaac Watts. When they reached the 3rd line of the last verse: 'Here, Lord, I give myself away,' I surrendered myself to my Savior, and my soul was flooded with celestial light. I sprang to my feet shouting, 'Hallelujah!' I gave my heart to Him, and what a Joy I received!" - Fanny Crosby
It was not until almost 100 years after the death of Watts that an American choir leader decided to make some of the old hymns easier for children to sing. "Tampering with the hymns," the old-timers called it. Ralph E. Hudson took the words of "Alas, and did my Savior bleed?", wrote an inspiring tune, and added a chorus that might have caused the author's hair to stand on end. ... I am glad Hudson added that chorus. Indeed, it heralds my own experience. It was while kneeling at the cross that I first saw the light. There the burdens of my heart rolled away. It was there by faith I received my sight. - Hymn Stories by Wilbur Konkel</article>
