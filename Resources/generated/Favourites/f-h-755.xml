	<article author="Abiodun Adeniyi" email="adejohnab@gmail.com" city="Ijebu Ode" provst="Ogun" country="Nigeria" month="7" day="11" year="2014">I was asked to preach to Medical practitioners on Sunday and as I was preparing my sermon this old song came up in my spirit as the congregation song for that message. I believe that God wants to do something special in the area of healing. I pray that all who are sick now wherever they are receive instant healing now in the name of Jesus. So shall it be.</article>

By singing it meditative lay, my faith has been strengthened. I have the assurance that many of those prayed for will be touched by the GREAT HEALER. Thanks for making the hymn available online.</article>
