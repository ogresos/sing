    <article author="Hudson" email="h.garratt@gmail.com" city="Wellington" provst="" country="New Zealand" month="3" day="1" year="2014">This hymn especially verse 2 reminded me of Song of Songs 2:5, "Sustain me with raisin cakes, Refresh me with apples, for I am sick with love." the footnote on verse 4 note 1 is lovely, "....sustained with Christ as the bread of life...refreshed with Him as the fruit of life...to heal her lovesickness in her longing for her Beloved..." Yes the Lord is here in our spirit, yet He is not; He is in heaven, hence we pine after Him longing to see Him face to face.</article>
