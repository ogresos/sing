Oh Lord only You! Your love constrains me and keeps me from the self, sin and the world. Thy love so great! Keep us loving You that we would express You! Thank You Lord for satisifying us! Oh Lord we pray for Your expression on the whole earth that You would be satisfied!</article>

He wrote many books and articles. And though he also wrote a number of hymns, he is better known for the tunes he contributed for hymns such as: Jesus I Am Resting, Resting; Like a River Glorious; and Loved With Everlasting Love. He was greatly influenced by the evangelistic ministry of Dwight L. Moody and Ira Sankey in Britain during the 1870â€™s. His music reflects what he learned from them. From 1882 to 1889 he made a seven-year evangelistic tour of the world. - wordwisehymns</article>
