	<article author="Galya Campano" email="gcamp2001@hotmail.com" city="Lakeland" provst="Florida" country="United States" month="4" day="18" year="2016">This hymn was played/sung by our music director this morning, immediately following an altar call by the pastor, including a call to saints who wanted to profess dedication and obedience. 
I had not sung it in decades, and the effect on me was electrifying. Some lyrics can never be substituted by those of newer songs; the words sound as fresh as if the Spirit had just dropped them in our hearts. THIS hymn is a perfect example of why The Church must continue to keep some old hymns in its repertoire. As far as some old songs go, new writers/composers "can NOT say it better."</article>

Recently I have been trying to recall some of the words. HIGHER GROUND has been on my top list of favorites since childhood. Then at an early age at mid-week prayer services when sometimes the selection of a song was requested, I would suggest Higher Ground.
How very moving it has been to note the comments of other striving Christians
around the world; for we are "called to be saints" and we pray for one another; I am further reminded of the message in the song:
"When we all get to heaven, what a day of rejoicing it will be; when we all see Jesus we'll sing and shout the victory."</article>

	<article author="Sally" email="" city="Christchurch" provst="" country="New Zealand" month="3" day="29" year="2010">The words to this hymn came into my mind this morning as I came before God. I lost my 43 year old husband 8 weeks ago, suddenly. We have 5 children ages 11 -18. God has been faithfully holding me through this terrible devastation, and the grief I am experiencing. He is teaching me that this life we live on earth is not about smoothness and ease, it is about becoming totally reliant on Him...that it is the spiritual life that is important, and the physical one, which seeks to be comfortable is secondary. A smooth and comfortable life is not a good life...there is no need for God, there is no growth in Him. It was the words "a higher plane..." that came to my mind, He wants us to live above the turmoil or pleasure we are experiencing here on earth right now, and to live spiritually in total reliance on Him...the One who knows the end from the beginning, the One who is all-wise and knows what is best for us (even though we can't see it sometimes). He won't relent until He has it all...  God bless you, whoever you are reading this, may you experience life on 'a higher plane' today.</article>

I asked myself, is this true of me? Am I pressing on EVERY day? Lately, though, I have been practicing to pray each morning, "Lord, lead me on to higher ground today." Surely, this is a prayer that will be answered! I don't need to take responsibility for placing myself on higher ground. In fact, I can do nothing of myself that will bring me to higher ground. But, how I love my Good Shepherd! I just want to rest in Him as day by day He leads me into Himself!</article>
	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="12" day="29" year="2008">To be in the spirit is the key, the secret. In the spirit we will experience many wonderful things of Christ because we have crossed the Jordan and entered into Canaan. When we are in the spirit, we are in the rest, and we are in the Holy of Holies. Therefore, we must always renounce the natural man, the outer man. For example, many times in the Lord's work I was tempted by the enemy to quarrel with others. On those occasions I felt that my reason was right, that the case was mine, and that I had the doctrine to support me. Yet while I was trying to speak, something deep within restricted me and stopped me. In order to go along with that deep feeling, I had to drop my quarreling. Consequently, it seemed that I had nothing to say. But I can testify that every time I went along with the spirit, there was victory. If we take care of our spirit, the mighty One in our spirit will be our strength. We will be transcendent and victorious over many things. When we come to the meetings, we will come with many items of Christ to contribute, either in prayer, singing, giving a testimony, or speaking a short word. Philippians 4:13 says, "I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me." But where does Christ empower us? He empowers us in our spirit. Our mind is the stronghold and the open gate for the enemy, but our spirit is the base for the Lord to do His work. Thus, when we go along with the mind, we are defeated, even though we may be doing something good. But if we go along with the spirit, we will be victorious. We will be on a high mountain, on higher ground, and, in the words of a hymn, "on Canaan's tableland" (Hymns, #396). We will be in the heavens and will be transcendent.
