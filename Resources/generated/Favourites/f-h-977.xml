------------------
In the original, stanza 1, 2nd line, "Holy city of our God" is "Zion, city of our God."
In stanza 2, 3rd line, "blessed members" is "sons and daughters".
-----------------------
There is an additional stanza 3 following stanza 2 above:
Round each habitation hovering,
See the cloud and fire appear!
For a glory and a covâ€™ring
Showing that the Lord is near.
Thus deriving from our banner
Light by night and shade by day;
Safe they feed upon the manna
Which He gives them when they pray.
---------------------------------
In hymnal.net stanza 3, "constituents" is originally "inhabitants".
In the last stanza, last line, "members" is originally "children".</article>

It reminds me of my sovereignty and superiority as a child of God. I so much rely on His blood which shed for my sake at the cross of Calvary. Dear God may Your grace continue to be abundant to me, Amen.</article>
