	<article author="李 菲 麗" email="ofelia2k@yahoo.com" city="" provst="NC" country="United States" month="12" day="24" year="2012">Praise the Lord! This hymn is practically and genuinely so refreshing and renewing! I am so impressed by bro. Witness Lee's testimony in line with this hymn. "Because God wants us to be a new creation, He must dispense Himself as the newness into our being to renew us. In the sixty-six books of the Bible, only one verse tells us that God is always new, like an evergreen. In Hosea 14:8 our God is likened to an evergreen tree, a green fir tree. Because He is evergreen, He Himself becomes the evergreen element. Now He is dispensing Himself into our being as such an element to renew us. I do have the sense that every day I am newer. I am not older; I am newer. I am not old, because I am being renewed. Something of God as the "evergreen tree" is being dispensed into my being. (The Central Line of the Divine Revelation, Chapter 26, Section 1)</article>
