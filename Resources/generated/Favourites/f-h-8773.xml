The 'New Jerusalem is a sign, a symbol signifying the glorious fulfilment of God's eternal purpose according to the desire of His heart to have a corporate expression of Himself in Christ as the Firstborn Son and the many believers in Christ as the many sons. The New Jerusalem is not a physical city as is often construed. The New Jerusalem is one of the two greatest signs in the Bible (Rev. 21:2).
It was for this God created us, redeemed us, regenerated us and is transforming us, conforming us to the glorious image of His son. By being one spirit with the Lord, loving Him intensely above all else. we will receive the revelation, vision and experience of the New Jerusalem as a foretaste in this age. May we keep dreaming of the New Jerusalem until we are ushered into the reality.  This song always ushers me into the foretaste of the divine reality. Hallelujah for the New Jerusalem.</article>

New Jerusalem! Looking to the Lord and opening up to Him to allow Him to shine on, in, and through me... This age is coming to a consummation and how I need to be delivered from every earthly entanglement. We see in Colossians how Christ is the reality of all positive things in the universe (Col. 1:-3:11). He is our real rest, food, drink, covering, life... We must pursue to know Christ by experiencing Him in a full way day by day.
May we not be defrauded into thinking that salvation is the goal. Even the church-life is not the goal... but the means to reach the goal. Praise the Lord for the New Jerusalem - a composition of all God's chosen, redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified people built up for His "satisfaction in love" and "utmost rest" for all eternity for His expression! What a blessing, what a privilege to be a part of it! Praise the Lord!!!  We have a glorious eternal future! Dear Lord Jesus, how I repent for allowing anything to come in to occupy my heart, even "good" things. Thank Your Lord Jesus!!! You are everything to me!!! We love You Lord!!!</article>
