	<article author="Eunice" email="eunicegarcia76@gmail.com" city="Elmont" provst="NY" country="" month="5" day="13" year="2014">Hebrews 11:6 "He who comes forward to God must believe that He is...." - that means that we are not. As I discover that all I can do for the Lord is considered filthy rags, I set my hope on the Christ in whom I have believed in and in whom I have received. One sister shared that we may want to work for the Lord but He would say "I want you to be My work." How encouraging!!! We are His masterpiece, an expression of our Maker. Lord Jesus!!! I love You!!! Continue to work Yourself into me until You see Yourself as a reflection... Refine... burn away all that does not match You. Do gain each one of us for Your wonderful plan to be fulfilled.</article>

kõige eest, kõige eest mis Ta on teinud minu jaoks?
Ma võtan pääste karika
ja kutsun, ja kutsun, ja kutsun Isanda nime.</article>

	<article author="Igor Savinkin" email="igor.savinkin@gmail.com" city="Kaliningrad" provst="" country="Russia" month="3" day="8" year="2013">This hymn lyrics is from the Psalm 116. David intended to build a house for eternal God Jehovah. But Jehovah Himself stopped this "offer" of David. What can we give or offer to the Lord Jesus? NOTHING can we. The only thing the Lord is after is Himself to enter into us and live out of us. The way is for us to call on the Lord. David did it, realizing that nothing of himself he shall offer. I like it. What does eternal God need from temporal man? ... I want to enjoy the eternal God to be full of Him - the simplest way is to call on Him. This constitute me with His riches.</article>

	<article author="Rita" email="" city="Kampala" provst="" country="Uganda" month="5" day="23" year="2011">I love this song because all I can do for the Lord is call on Him. He causes me to call on Him. Even on my own I don't like to open my mouth but the Lord gushes out of me in a cry-O Lord Jesus. O Lord, O Lord.</article>
	<article author="Stanley F. Sroka Jr." email="" city="Chicago" provst="Illinois" country="United States" month="11" day="14" year="2010">The emphasis is to avail to the privilege to call upon the Lord as those in the past. Our deliverance and need of help, even after we put on the whole armour of God, can be called for. Joseph, David, Samson, Daniel, Isaiah, Elijah, and Jesus followed by the Apostles for Peter and Paul for his thorn. What is your daily need and salvation? Call on the name of the Lord!</article>

Then, I'll call and I'll call
and yield my earthen vessel to His
filling and use according to His pleasure and purpose.</article>
