	<article author="Henrich Brockhaus" email="henrich.brockhaus@wwu.edu" city="Bellingham" provst="WA" country="United States" month="5" day="18" year="2016" hostInfoIp="73.83.100.197">The precious blood of Jesus can never be overemphasized, because it was enough to cover all the sins of the world and it is still effective in blotting out the sins of every person who comes to Christ repentantly. The power of the blood keeps Satan in check and through it Christ wants us to be victorious in all spheres of life. 
I do have some issue with the chorus. The blood is not "ever flowing free!" It only flowed once and Christ is not hanging on the cross any longer; the empty cross reminds us of a work completed. Christ Himself said "It is finished!" Ever since Christ's death we have free access to God our Father through the blood once shed. Praise God for the "PRECIOUS, PRECIOUS BLOOD OF JESUS, SHED [past time] ON CALVARY."</article>
