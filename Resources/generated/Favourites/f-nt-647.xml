	<article author="Teresa" email="" city="Lower Hutt" provst="" country="New Zealand" month="1" day="14" year="2009">I'm really touched by this hymn. Recently, I had been feeling slightly down, but I was fellowshipping with another member of the Body, and this song was mentioned! Praise the Lord! In everything, we just need to TRUST HIM - even if we're feeling uncertain about something, we just need to turn to Him and live according to faith, trusting Him! 
After listening to this song countless times, it still enlightens me and encourages me to keep on trusting Him no matter what goes on in our lives! Lord Jesus, keep us trusting in You through faith! :)</article>
