	<article author="William Jeng" email="willjeng@gmail.com" city="Irvine" provst="CA" country="United States" month="4" day="15" year="2016">We can come forward w/ boldness to the throne of grace AT ANY TIME!
The Christian life is filled with many beginnings, courses, and endings. 
God sovereignly arranged this so that, whenever we meet failures, darkness or discouragements (nights), we can always consecrate our life back to Him anew (mornings). This high priest desires our willingness to come forward.
So let us COME!</article>

Denn wir haben nicht ein'n
hoh'n Priester, der nicht kann
haben Mitgefühl mit unseren Schwachheiten.
Sondern einen, der
in jeder Hinsicht wurde versucht so wie wir, doch
ohne Sünde.
Lass uns, daher mit Freimut,
hinzutrett'n
zum Gnadethron.
Damit Gnade und Barmherzigkeit es
wird uns zugeteilt.
Lob Dem Herrn!</article>
	<article author="Victor Santamaria" email="vsantama@web.de" city="Bremen" provst="" country="Germany" month="2" day="29" year="2016">Last time the Saints in Lyon translated this song into French:
"Notre souverain sacrificateur, 
il peut être touché de nos faibleses;
Il a eté tenté comme nous à tous égards, 
il était sans pêché, oui sanch pêché.
Approchons nous hardîment du thrône de la grâce 
afin de recevoir misericorde et grâce
un secours opportun!"
Do we have spanisch Version? I cant stop singing this hymn today!
Amen</article>

Olla puudutatud meie nõrkuste tunnetega,
Vaid See, kes on olnud kõigiti kiusatud nagu me
Kuid patuta, kuid patuta.

Tulgem siis julgusega
Armu trooni ette, et me võiks
Võtta vastu halastust ja leida armu
Aegsaks abiks.</article>
