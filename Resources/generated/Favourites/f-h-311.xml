	<article author="Lungawiruol Khawbung" email="rpc.lawr@gmail.com" city="Churachandpur" provst="Manipur" country="India" month="9" day="8" year="2015">This classic hymn touches my soul in a very fresh way. It reminds me of the amazing love of Christ who humbled Himself and became obedient to deathâ€”even death on a cross! so that a sinner like me will be saved. This is an amazing story of the assurance and the joy of our salvation.</article>

I really like this hymn. It reminds me of home where we use to sing it in Swahili using the book of songs called "Nyimbo za Mungu" meaning songs for God.
Fortunately I took a book before leaving.
I've just discovered this website some minutes ago and I am really blessed. Thanks.
May Jesus bless you.</article>

	<article author="Lucia" email="lucialu@msn.com" city="Valdosta" provst="GA" country="United States" month="5" day="19" year="2013">I really enjoyed singing and listening to this hymn. Recently I read the note from the writings of John: John 8: 3, and 1 John 1:

The one who is without sin - the Lord
The one who is qualified to condemn sin - the Lord
The one who is qualified to forgive sin - the Lord
The one who is able to set people free from sin - the Lord 
The Lord is the self-existing, and ever-existing God, the great I AM, who was lifted up on the cross, to draw all man to Himself.
The eternal God, came into us to be life and light to deliver us from the bondage and darkness of sin (NT Recovery Version p. 403).

Amen, what can I say but saying, "I am only a sinner saved by Grace
This is my story, to God be the glory!".</article>

	<article author="Dr. David P. Wilson" email="" city="Pine Bush" provst="NY" country="U.S.A." month="12" day="3" year="2007">These classic hymns stir the soul, revitalize the inner man, inspire godliness and impart strength for the journey. We need to be singing hymns in our churches like this every week! They will produce changed lives.</article>
	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="12" day="3" year="2009">In the midst of the saints we should not be able to boast of anything. There is nothing special about elders and deacons. They are only brothers. The chorus of hymn #251 in Chinese says, "I am a sinner saved by grace!" We have no position to assume among the brothers and sisters. We are not a special class of people among them; we are sinners saved by grace. Although the elders and co-workers do not flaunt a difference among the saints, their attitude indicates that they are different from the brothers and that they are a little higher than the brothers. May the Lord have mercy on us. We need to remove such a situation from among us. If people who come to the church can tell who among us are the "bosses" and who are the "subordinates," it is to our shame. We must remove the concept of rank.
