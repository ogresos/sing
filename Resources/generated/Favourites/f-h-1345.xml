The moment our heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. This is far better than "shall be" taken away.</article>
	<article author="Jeremiah" email="" city="" provst="" country="Singapore" month="2" day="24" year="2012">I searched Youtube for this song but couldn't find it.. Finally when I google searched for it, google directed me to your site.. Thanks and praise the Lord.. This is such a beautiful hymn.. 

I'm a new believer.. got baptised 2011 Good Friday (April)

I've listened to this hymn during last year, year-end conference, it reminds me of the conference so much.. Missed those times with the Saints etc.. 

God bless you,
Jeremiah</article>
