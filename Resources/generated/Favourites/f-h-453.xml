	<article author="June Bell" email="" city="York" provst="North Yorkshire" country="" month="6" day="17" year="2014">This hymn means so much to me. My late Mum would sing this as a solo at her choir concerts and when she was too frail the choir's conductor would not allow anyone else sing 'For Me'. Her rendition used to move people to tears.</article>
	<article author="Norman" email="" city="" provst="" country="Venezuela" month="8" day="13" year="2012">Just one verse lacking...Maybe the author had it but it got lost...I don't know. It seems to need one between verses 3 and 4...

Dark night enclosed Thee there,
As my sin Thou did'st bear.
That I Thy Joy might share.
E'en me, dear Lord, e'en me.</article>
