The leadings of my Father’s hand;
But I shall own His ways were right,
When welcomed to His presence bright.

How wonderful to have the surety that His ways were the best, we can trust His ways, Lord cause us to walk in the light, to walk in Your ways, to take from Our Father's hands what He chose for us. You'll be satisfied and we will too.</article>
