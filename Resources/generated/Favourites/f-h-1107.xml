And thus our oneness visibly is shown.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="31" year="2008">The believers are supported with the power of Christ's resurrection in long-suffering, in the uniting bond of peace, and in all the positive needs for joining together and knitting together and for the rich supply of every joint and the operation in measure of each one part. This means that in the church life, we have to be one. You have to be joined to me and I have to be joined to you. In the Lord's recovery, all of the races with all the different colors—white, black, yellow, brown, and red—are blended together. The peoples of this earth are all so different. How could all these peoples be one Body? There is one Body in the universe, and we express it here on earth for all to see (see chorus of Hymns, #1107). We do not want people to see divisions or opinions. This is why we need to be joined together and knit together.

The only way we can be really one is by the application of the cross and the power of Christ's resurrection. His power of resurrection is sufficient for us. He gives us the cross to bear, but He also supports us with the power of His resurrection. It is in this way that we are transformed. Paul said that he desired to know Christ and the power of His resurrection that he might be conformed to Christ's death (Phil. 3:10). We should live and serve not by our natural power, but by the power of Christ's resurrection.
