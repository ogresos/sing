For God to shine the light on us, to uncover hidden sins. and through our faults and Trials, to know and believe God's promises. He never lies, and what He promises He also Gives. I am astounded day by day by God's wonderful Compassion, but most of all His Love. Amen which surrounds my Family and myself. Hallelujah!!!!!!!!!!</article>
