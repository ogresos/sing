I keep trying to tell the Good News to my relatives but they just write me off like "yea, yea". I suppose that's because they are J-witnesses and I am a Christian who follows the Bible. I can't make them understand; for God so loved the world... that whosoever believes in His name etc. I will keep praying and trying. Wish me luck. Thanks.</article>

There are no words to describe how thankful and amazed I am at how how much the Lord loves me. We as humans chose somthing and love or like it for a day or two then we hate it, but Lord chooses something and loves it eternally, and even though we sinned so many times He still loves us and is still here for us. Oh we have such a faithful God! Oh Lord I love You!</article>

Cause me daily, every morning to come to You and enjoy as my life supply, as my real satisfaction, as my all in all, so I can overcome the day with You. Lord Jesus, continually captivate me with Your beauty and soften my heart, so that I WILL ALWAYS BE IN LOVE WITH YOU, forever and ever, Amen.</article>

	<article author="Bro. JP" email="" city="Quezon City" provst="" country="Philippines" month="4" day="18" year="2010">I like this hymn because it reminds me of how our matchless and priceless Lord truly loves us that He willingly died on our behalf. It also makes me realize that everything in our Christian life is not by our own effort, it is by our daily enjoyment of His presence by practically coming to His word in the morning to be revived and enjoy His sweet dispensing into our being. It is by this dispensing that we are strengthened to live the Christian life.

Lord, truly You are the precious and matchless One! Thank You Lord for willingly dying for us to wash us and justify us. Lord keep us in Your presence, teach us to abide in You daily.</article>
