    <article author="Michele Miller Jean" city="Ocoee" provst="FL" country="United States" month="9" day="13" year="2011">This was my favorite childhood hymn, growing up in Trinity Evangelical Lutheran of Runnemede, NJ. I've always loved how it calls Christians to rise up in battle against the forces of evil in our world and our temporal flesh. Even today, at age (nearly) 63, this version (with this melody) is still one of my all-time favorite hymns!</article>
