The words touch me because it is about real love. How wonderful it is that we can be in His wonderful real beauty and we don´t have to be afraid for anything if we are in the real rich of Love. And even we can see the wonder of Watchman Nee and the talents of Mozart. God was given the human different arts as a tool to tell more in Love. He gave human His talents of real rich and Love and if we are study our talents we can brighten the world of real love in Christ.</article>

    <article author="李 菲 麗" city="" provst="NC" country="United States" month="1" day="2" year="2011">I prayed and sang this hymn written by Watchman Nee. Praise the Lord, what a great assurance that I am "One with Thee"--a wonderful reality of the mingling, an organic union of God and man in all the stages that the Lord has done, is doing and will be doing! Praise the Lord for the all-inclusive, all-extensive "One with Thee" as a Man, in His incarnation; "One with Thee" in His all terminating and life-dispensing death; "One with Thee" in His resurrection; "One with Thee" in His ascension; "One with Thee in His glory, in His return. What can I say but I praise and worship You, Lord, I am one with Thee!</article>
