    <article author="Aidan" email="" city="London" provst="" country="" month="5" day="3" year="2014">What a difference this kind of fellowship makes. I too have a longing for such fellowship. In Phil 1:8 Paul said: "For God is my witness how I long after you all in the inward parts of Christ Jesus." "... In longing after the saints, the apostle was one with Christ even in the bowels, the tender inward parts, of Christ. This indicates that for Paul to enjoy Christ meant that he was one with Christ's inward parts, in which he enjoyed Christ as the supply of grace." (Phil. 1:8 Footnote 1.)</article>

So beautiful. It makes a huge difference to be a part of the Body of Christ and under its covering and authority. Praise the Lord!</article>
    <article author="James" email="" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="11" day="15" year="2010">Don't forget authority! Authority issues from function in the Body and is God-ordained. We find our place in the Body, based on God-given function, and we strengthen the Body by being and functioning properly in the right place. In other words, we not only need the Body. The Body needs us. Please, Lord, guide us to our proper place and function in Your Body, and make our joy full. Amen.</article>
    <article author="Theresa" email="" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="11" day="15" year="2010">by the previous comments I'm reminded of the hymn: The love of God and the grace of Christ and fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all (from II Cor 13:14).</article>
    <article author="Sherry" email="" city="" provst="" country="United States" month="11" day="7" year="2010">I too long for fellowship in the love of God and the truth of the word of His Spirit. I am so tired of searching for a church. I am so tired of hearing bits and pieces of truth mingled with lies. Yet, I don't want to be lost in self-deception, pretension, independence (from God), or seclusion from the body of Christ. Only God can deliver me from this place of isolation.</article>
    <article author="Max" email="" city="Chicago" provst="IL" country="United States" month="10" day="6" year="2010">I appreciate the above comment. I have recently begun to actually experience some effects from the "spiritual cancer" of independence, seclusion, self-deception and pretension. May the Lord deliver us from such a predicament by bringing us into coordination and building! Nothing in the world compares to the coordination and building of the Body.</article>
    <article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="25" year="2008">This hymn has six stanzas, and each stanza has a particular word. In the first stanza it would be good to highlight the word independence. The second stanza has the word seclusion, the third stanza has the word self-deception, and the fourth stanza has the word pretension. Independence, seclusion, self-deception, and pretension are four things we have to overcome. These are the elements of our spiritual cancer. Verses 5 and 6 are on the positive side. Verse 5 mentions coordination and verse 6 has the word building. After the four negative things are cut off, we have the positive thingsâ€”coordination and building. We need to sing #847 with the release of the spirit. We should not sing in a dying way. We need to sing in a releasing way.
