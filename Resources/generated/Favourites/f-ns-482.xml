	<article author="William Jeng" email="willjeng@gmail.com" city="Irvine" provst="CA" country="United States" month="5" day="1" year="2015">We consecrated this song to the Lord during the 2014 Poland Conference. Each of the verses are parallel to one of the message banners, and what God desires to accomplish on the earth today. Our God desires a house, a home in man's heart, by simply praying "Lord we give ourselves for Your building!" we give Him the ground to work in and through us. Let's allow Him to operate in us by giving Him the FIRST PLACE!</article>

consecrating myself for the Lord's testimony,
"God needs a group of us to turn the age,
To fellowship and consecrate,
Our prayer is “Lord, we give ourselves to Thee,
We’ll be the builders for Your economy.”</article>
