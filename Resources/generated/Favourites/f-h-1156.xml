Working for Him means nothing to the Lord Jesus. If you do not believe this today, some day you will believe it. But that day will be too late. It is not that we work for Him but that He works on us. We must not be merely His workers but His work (Eph. 2:10). We must take in the Lord so that He may perfume us and transform us. Then we will progress from one figure to another and will arrive at the stage of the palanquin and the crown. But we still need to go on to the garden and the city. May the Lord be merciful to us and take us all the way! Life and building are the two main items of the Lordâ€™s recovery. This is why we must attain to the garden and the city. 
May the Lord be merciful to us and take us all the way!
From the book: Life and Building as portrayed in the Song of Songs, ch. 8, section 5.</article>
