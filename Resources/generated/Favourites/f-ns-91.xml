If I am full and think I’m rich,
Empty, You’ll send me away;
Continually I’m hungry, Lord.
My heart on You will stay.

I pray my heart will always stay on You Lord, and, if I am too satisfied with worldly things, take them from me and help me set my heart on You. Help us keep our hearts set on You, there are so many things our there demanding our attention. Thank You Lord. 

Amen.</article>

Give me such a heart that longs after You so desperately. And keep my gaze fixed on You alone regardless of the circumstances, none other to look at but at You! Lord, make all your saints hungry seekers of You!

As the hart pants after the streams of water, so my soul pants for You, O God. My soul thirsts for God, for the living God.
