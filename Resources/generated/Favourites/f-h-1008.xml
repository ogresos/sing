	<article author="Edidiong Isong Udoh" email="eddyalive5@yahoo.com" city="Ph" provst="Rivers states" country="Nigeria" month="8" day="19" year="2016">Apart from the cleansing power and forgiveness offered by the blood of Jesus. One night I was praying with a friend the Lord opened his eyes and he saw a demon in a corner of the room as I plead the blood of Jesus the demon vanished. Praise God there is power in the blood. The bible says and they overcame him the devil by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony. When the blood is pleaded out of a pure heart as and faith filled heart it protects, dismiss evil presence. Some churches had been deceived by saying where do see the blood? The blood of Jesus is the very life of Christ and so when you plead if you are invoking the life of Christ into manifestations. Wherever there is a manifested presence of Christ Jesus Eden can be found, health is restored peace and security, quietness etc is found thank God for the precious blood of Jesus it's the redeeming blood plead it by faith anywhere anytime anyhow amen</article>
