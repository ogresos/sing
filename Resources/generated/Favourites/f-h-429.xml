	<article author="Mrs Olabisi" email="bisidowu@hotmail.com" city="Chafford Hundred" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="9" day="13" year="2015">This is an awesome hymn. It is one for courage and strength.  When l need encouragement the Holy Spirit reminds me of this fabulous hymn.
The enemy has lost the battle, through the death of our loving Saviour JESUS CHRIST. But he still likes to kill, steal and destroy our joy. But never loose hope let your faith look up to the man of calvary and be strengthened and encouraged.
After all, Christ has said, l will never leave you nor forsake you. Be encouraged and may the Lord be your guide now and for evermore. Amen.</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="4" day="26" year="2013">At 22, Ray Palmer was having a tough year. He wanted to go into the ministry but was stuck teaching in New York City. He was lonely, depressed, and sick. Then he found a German poem about a sinner kneeling before the cross. He translated it and added 4 stanzas.
"I wrote the verses with tender emotion," he said later. "There was not the slightest thought of writing for another eye, least of all writing a hymn for Christian worship."
Two years later, while visiting Boston, he ran across his friend Lowell Mason. Mason, a major figure in American music in the early 1800's was preparing a new hymnal. He asked Palmer if he'd like to contribute anything. Palmer bashfully showed Mason these verses. "You may live many years and do many good things," Mason said, "but I think you will be best known to posterity as the author of 'My Faith Looks Up to Thee.'" - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>
