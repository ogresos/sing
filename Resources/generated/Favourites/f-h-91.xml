And when it is sung, it is rearranged in such a way that the passion which the Savior is experiencing in the Garden of Gethsemane, is drained from it, and the hymn becomes a meaningless chorus of contemporary musical showmanship. I love this hymn. It gives a passionate depiction of the pathos, the internal agony of ourLord and Savior Jesus Christ. I am requesting it to be sung tonight in reverence and in remembrance of that awful moment when Jesus suffers in the garden-alone.</article>

But it came once more with all its beauty, love and challenge. It speaks of victory in defeat. Praise HIS name.</article>

We used to sing this hymn at consecration service. Beautiful lovely feeling of emotion in worshipping God. 
God Bless you sir for sharing this hymn. It brought back memories of when we saints were humble and strive to live Holy before God. Thank you.</article>
