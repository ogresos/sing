    <article author="Jeannise Sandoval" email="" city="" provst="California" country="United States" month="12" day="28" year="2009">This is one of my favorite hymns because it's self-explanatory about how we need Christ each and every day. There is not one day we can say we aren't going to live without Jesus...because it isn't possible. Nothing is ever possible without Christ! Lord, I need You!</article>
    <article author="Anonymous" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="10" day="12" year="2009">He who comes forward to God must believe that He is...so that must mean that we are not. In the book Song of Songs you have an individual Christ seeker, who at some point starts looking at herself (Please don't be bothered by the feminine use as we are all considered females in God's eyes). She then becomes introspective and starts to analyze herself and begins to over care for her spiritual condition which results in a wall of seclusion. I have this tendency, but by the Lord's mercy I am able to find a way out. It's by calling, O Lord Jesus and confessing my need for Him. And how He is able to save those who come forward to Him!!! Saints, just love Him, pursue after Him, give your all to Him. Let's be one by applying the Triune God to our entire being and make ourselves ready to meet our dear lovely Bridegroom. He is after His Bride, His counterpart. He cannot come until the Bride makes herself ready. Don't listen to Satan, he's a creep and he's already been judged. The Lord is near. Hallelujah!!!


Come quickly, Lord,
We can't wait anymore.
Please make haste, dear Beloved!
Your Bride calls for Thee.

Come quickly, Lord, Amen.</article>
