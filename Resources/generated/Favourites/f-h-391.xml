"He sang Wales into Piety". He was the poet laureate of the Welsch revival. Soon all Wales was singing their way to the coal mines and soccer matches. And their favorite hymn was this marching song by one of their own.

The original has 5 verses and a different tune.</article>

This site is great - even allowing me to build my personal album BUT, quite a few lines have been altered from their classical settings!
