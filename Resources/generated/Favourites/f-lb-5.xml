	<article author="Joesyh" email="" city="Shreveport" provst="LA" country="United States" month="9" day="20" year="2012">We sang this song in young people gospel meeting and fell in love with Lord and become the lovers of Christ. Very touching.</article>
	<article author="Tami Bundrock" email="" city="Deer Park" provst="WA" country="United States" month="6" day="11" year="2012">Oh Lord, when I think of all the ways you show Your love for me, I am awe-struck over and over again! I cannot help myself even to love You as You so deserve. Even that needs to come from You, Oh Mighty God! Teach me Your ways, O Lord, and lead me in Your truth everlasting. I pray in Your precious Son's name. AMEN.</article>

This song always brings me to tears and reminds me that I belong to HIM and the church.
Oh how I earnestly desire to be used by Him for Him and His Body. Gain me Lord, strengthen me into my inner man that YOU be magnified in my daily living as I traverse my walk on earth and that I be transformed and conformed in Your very being so that when I see You then I'd be like You in life and in nature but not in the Godhead. Hallelujaaaaaaaaaaaaah...
AMEN!</article>

How terrible to forget something so vital for life!! Then I get lost in works, forgetting He actually desires me. Thank God for this reminder.</article>
	<article author="Paul Ten" email="" city="Birmingham" provst="West Midlands" country="United Kingdom" month="1" day="16" year="2010">After last night opening word from Ron Kangas in video training, it suddenly reminded me about this song. It reminded me that how much I have been pursuing "the things of Him" rather than "Him, my beloved." In New Jerusalem, in new heaven and new earth, there is no war with His enemy, there is no cross nor burden to bear, no tears to shed because it is His eternal intention that we may be His bride and Him as our bridegroom for His eternal satisfaction.</article>
