Here's the first verse.

Sweet hour of prayer! Sweet hour of
  prayer!
That calls me from a world of care,
And bids me at my Father's throne
Make all my wants and wishes known;
In seasons of distress and grief, 
My soul has often found relief,
And oft escaped the tempter's snare
By thy return, sweet hour of prayer.

God bless you all who pray!</article>
