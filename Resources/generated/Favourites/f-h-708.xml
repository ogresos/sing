    <article author="李 菲 麗" city="" provst="NC" country="United States" month="10" day="31" year="2010">What is so refreshing and touches me the most is "fresh as the dew of the morning". When the Israelites received their first fine,round flakes (manna),it was preceded by dew (Exodus 16:11-14)...And when the layer of dew lifted, there upon the surface of the wilderness were fine round flakes, fine as the frost on the earth... O Lord Jesus, what a surprise it must have been for the people who had gone to sleep the previous night murmuring, to get up and see their surroundings covered with a carpet of lovely, fresh dew. From the physical point of view, dew was perhaps necessary to moisten the dry desert soil so that when people picked up the fine, round flakes it would be free of dry soil particles adhering to it....."And when the dew fell on the camp at night, the manna would fall with it."(Numbers 11:9). The dew is so significant from God for His complaining people, that whatever happened, wherever they went, He would never leave them alone nor forsake them. His desire is to feed them, to supply them for the accomplishment of His purpose...to be in the good land! Praise the Lord, this also applies to me!

    <article author="Steve Miller" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="10" day="24" year="2009">The word "stand till the trial is over, stand till the tempest is done" seems to have been the Lord's instant speaking to the hymn's author when he was in a time of severe trial, perhaps when he was imprisoned by the Japanese during WWII. These words encourage me that the trouble is only temporary, and that I need to continue to stand.

Verse 2 is a warning not to shrink back from faith at this time as in Hebrews 10:35-39 followed by a request for dependence on the Lord's faith and life. Trials should cause us to be more dependent upon the Lord's spirit and life (Psalm 22:11, 19), and not upon man.

Verse 3 is a request for the Lord's light. He does not pray for the trouble to go away, but for the Lord's faith, life and light. In time of trouble we need the Lord's enlightenment more than for the problem to be solved (Psalm 13).</article>
