	<article author="Marilyn Sharif" email="msharif@gmu.edu" city="Fairfax" provst="VA" country="United States" month="8" day="23" year="2013">My elderly mother died recently in the morning. After a long, slow decline in her health, over a period of years due to dementia, she experienced a stroke, and then a rapid decline over a period of weeks. During her last day and a half, she experienced acute respiratory distress, which was finally relieved by a respiratory specialist at the hospital. Then she slept peacefully for about six hours. Finally, after being assured she was not alone, she took a deep, relaxed breath as if she were going into a deep sleep. Her nurse said it was one of the most peaceful passings she had ever witnessed. She said she was supposed to be in church that Sunday morning. I assured her that she was in church. The words of this song, Fresh as the dew of the morning, express perfectly my mother's passing into glory to be forever with her Lord Jesus. The Lord was truly there to usher her into His Kingdom (see Psalm 23). Thank You Lord! And, thank You to her nurse that morning. We were truly blessed by your ministry!</article>

And what touches me the most is that, this dew is with the manna. The manna is the supply that we need. Day by day, we need to come to Him and open ourselves to receive His fresh and new dispensing.</article>

	<article author="P.C." email="" city="" provst="" country="Canada" month="3" day="8" year="2012">There may be dry spells in our Christian life with inexplicable circumstances causing our enjoyment of the Lord to fade. At these times, we must realize that the Lord is mercifully calling us, wooing us, beckoning us to come to Him in a deeper way. 

The seeker in Song of Songs 3:1 says, "I sought him whom my soul loves; I sought him, but found him not."  Sometimes we think the Lord is mad at us, but He simply wants us to 'come away' to the 'cleft of the precipice,' signifying the cross of Christ, which can deliver us from the self introspection.

At these junctures of our lives, may we know the Lord in a deeper and sweeter way by coming to Him in our troubling situations. How long must we wait? That is up to the Lord, but do not cease coming forward. "Stand till the trial is over, stand till the kingdom is won." Our Father is well pleased to give us the kingdom (Luke 12:32) but He wants us continue running until we touch Him.</article>
