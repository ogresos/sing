	<article author="Steve Miller" email="" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="4" day="21" year="2012">Ps 32:8 is one of my all time favorite verses. It says literally, "I will cause you to understand and will direct you in this way you should go. I will counsel you. My eye is upon you."

It is the experience of the New Covenant (Heb 8:11; Isa 54:13).

"My eye is upon you" is comforting and constraining. In what I am going through, the Lord's eye is upon me. Knowing that the Lord's eye is upon me causes me to live and think before the Lord.</article>
	<article author="CF" email="" city="" provst="" country="Canada" month="3" day="27" year="2012">What a wonderful encouragement! "On the way from earth to glory, I will guide Thee with Mine eye!" How merciful and kind the Lord is. How tender and faithful. We can CLING to His promises and claim them before Him. And even when the enemy comes to accuse and discourage us we can fight him with the word of our testimony: "ON THE WAY FROM EARTH TO GLORY, MY LORD WILL GUIDE ME WITH HIS EYE!"</article>
