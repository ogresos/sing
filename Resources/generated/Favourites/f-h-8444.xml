    <article author="Jason" month="2" day="17" year="2008">I think this hymn was a Chinese rendition of Hymn No. 528 'The King of love my Shepherd is' by H.W. Baker. The poetics in either version are non-translatable, although both are versions of Psalm 23. But I must say, the English version by H.W. Baker covers Psalm 23 more completely. For example, a very important mentioning of God's house in the last stanza was included in Baker's rendition, as well as in the original Psalm, yet neglected in the Chinese rendition. Many older Chinese saints like this hymn because of its Chinese-ish melody, but do you know the Chinese version is singable with the English melody by John B. Dykes as well?</article>
