We used to sing it in the Church. It lifted me and my spirit high whenever I sing and listen to it. It makes my tears flow. Its so touching and encouraging knowing that my God promises and always with me all the time.
These days whenever I am sitting with my keyboard I start singing this song. I love all the lines ..... especially the last stanza "Steps unseen before me, Hidden dangers near; Nearer still my Saviour, Whispering, "Be of cheer", Joy, like birds of springtime, To my heart have flown, Singing all so sweet, "He will not leave me alone".... ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽµðŸŽ¼ðŸŽ»ðŸŽ¹ðŸŽ·ðŸŽº</article>

	<article author="Shimona Francis" email="anomish25@yahoo.com" city="Kingston" provst="" country="Jamaica" month="2" day="25" year="2014">This song is such a sweet reminder that despite how sometimes we feel like God has deserted us, we can still hold on to the beautiful promise He made to us. He promises never to leave us alone. So, we should take courage and lift our faith because He is right there. When the fight gets too much for us, He will step in and take it over. He has, not stored in yet because despite our doubts, He knows we have the strength we need to overcome.</article>

	<article author="Rosita" email="" city="Anaheim" provst="CA" country="United States" month="1" day="16" year="2012">This song is really good! Today is the first time I heard it. "Roses fade around me, Lilies bloom and die,
Earthly sunbeams vanish," but Jesus! Jesus our Beloved Jesus! So present, so real, always new! With us today and with us till the end!

How wonderful that we do not have to wait until our roses fade and our earthly sunbeams vanish, today and at any time we can take Him as our Habitation, our dwelling place! And thus enjoy His very, sweet, always prevailing presence.</article>

This song was like my breath. Still today at the age of 29 also, I like this song very much. This is the song that strengthened me at times of trouble, during my hostel days, when my parents were not with me. Truly He never left me lonely.</article>
	<article author="Dr. Janetta Nithia" email="" city="Madurai" provst="Tamilnadu" country="India" month="2" day="25" year="2010">I remember when I was in my age of 6 I sang this song with my grandma when she was 78 (and now she is no more) and one of my friends today asked the lyrics of this song to sing to her mother who felt sick and she asked her to sing the same song 
to her mother in her last bed days... I really like this song very much and I believe this same song will comfort me also during my last breath I love my Jesus.

We would go to Marakwet and Kerio valley with my friends to preach the gospel of Jesus there. A friend of mine called Zipporah taught me the song. And it has been such an encouragement all these days.</article>
