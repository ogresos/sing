	<article author="Daniel Jackson" email="danielfjackson@gmail.com" city="Fullerton" provst="CA" country="United States" month="10" day="9" year="2014">This song was written by August M. Toplady. It was then translated into Chinese and then translated from Chinese back into English. The version in "Hymns" is a translation of a translation. The original lyrics are:
From whence this fear and unbelief?
Hath not the Father put to grief
His spotless Son for me?
And will the righteous Judge of men
Condemn me for that debt of sin
Which, Lord, was charged on Thee?
Complete atonement Thou hast made,
And to the utmost Thou hast paid
Whate'er Thy people owed;
How then can wrath on me take place,
If sheltered in Thy righteousness,
And sprinkled with Thy blood?
If thou hast my discharge procured,
And freely in my room endured
The whole of wrath divine;
Payment God cannot twice demand,
First at my bleeding Surety's hand,
And then again at mine.
Turn then, my soul, unto thy rest!
The merits of thy great High Priest
Have bought thy liberty;
Trust in His efficacious blood,
Nor fear thy banishment from God,
Since Jesus died for thee.</article>

	<article author="李 菲 麗" email="" city="" provst="NC" country="United States" month="1" day="2" year="2011">"The debt that Christ for me hast paid/Would God another mind have made/To claim again for me?/" Then why should I worry, doubt and fear? Even though "all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" the believers are justified wholly by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus! Hallelujah! I should never worry, doubt and fear! I as a sinner, who is His enemy, has been reconciled to Him, made one with Him--whom I once was despised and rejected. Now I am enjoying a blessed oneness with Him through His redeeming grace!</article>

	<article author="Hymnal.net" city="" provst="" country="" month="4" day="17" year="2014">Now, can God take back this salvation which Christ has purchased? Absolutely not! Since the debt was paid, for God to demand it again from us would be unrighteous. The same righteousness which formerly called for our condemnation now calls for our justification. What powerful security this gives to our salvation! Even a worldly judge would not demand the same fine to be paid twice. Certainly God, the source of all justice and righteousness, cannot do so. As Watchman Nee wrote in a hymn:

For me forgiveness He has gained,
And full acquittal was obtained,
All debts of sin are paid;
God would not have His claim on two,
First on His Son, my Surety true,
And then upon me laid.

Thus, the Bible declares that when God saves us, He shows forth His righteousness (Rom. 1:16-17; 3:25-26).

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="10" day="23" year="2012">...Without righteousness, faith has no basis. Thank God that our sins have been forgiven. Thank Him that He will never judge us anymore. As the hymn says:

God would not have His claim on two,
First on His Son, my Surety true,
And then upon me laid.

Our hearts are at rest, for our sins have been judged.
