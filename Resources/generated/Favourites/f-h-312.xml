	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="8" day="11" year="2013">Philip Doddridge was a gifted student, but he turned down a scholarship to train for ministry in the Church of England. He chose instead to side with the Dissenters, the Nonconformists who emphasized personal commitment to Christ over institutional loyalty. He went to a Dissenter college, and later he pastored a Congregational church. He wrote about 370 hymns, never seeing any of them published in his lifetime. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton

Additional 2nd stanza by Doddridge:
Grace first contrived the way
 To save rebellious man;
 And all the steps that grace display
 Which drew the wondrous plan.</article>

What a gracious God He is. I have searched for this song for years. I only knew the Yoruba version. I just prayed today that God would help me locate it in English. After some manipulative translations I finally got it here. I'm grateful to God Who gave the inspiration to write the song, the wisdom of technology that created search engines and the grace upon whosoever it was that uploaded it here.
This has been the song of my life story--grace, wonderful grace! Another great song in my heart tonight is "More about Jesus..." May His grace lead us Home. Thanks!</article>

	<article author="Olusegun Dada" email="" city="Abuja" provst="" country="Nigeria" month="4" day="12" year="2012">When I was a kid in the Methodist church of Nigeria, I used to hear my mother sing this song in Yoruba, (ore ofe sha) and whenever I heard her sing it I do understand the value she placed on the song, herself coming from a Muslim background. I didn't fully understand the import of the song until many years after when I dedicated my live to Christ and looking back now, it is only the Grace of God that has brought me thus far, anytime I hear or sing this song, tears well up in my eyes as it does now. Grace really is a charming sound.</article>

The chorus of the version we sing is "Saved by grace alone! This is all my plea. Jesus died for all mankind and Jesus died for me." I find this tune to be very soothing and calming, like He is standing right by me. Grace! Grace! Grace! That's what it's all about, for no one can earn this great salvation.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="31" year="2010">From hymn #248 in the Chinese hymnal
(a literal translation; cf. Hymns, #312)

1. Grace arises, replacing sin,
To reign in my spirit,
Saving me from the power of sin
And my corrupted nature.

Grace is sufficient for me!
I'll never feel powerless!
Christ lives in my spirit
For me to receive grace upon grace.

2. Grace enables my feet
To tread the heavenly pathway;
His grace—timely and rich—
Has never failed me.

3. What can be greater than grace!
He is God coming to men,
He is God manifested in the flesh,
He is God in me.

I am what I am,
It is by the grace of God!
God's grace is manifested in me
To be the eternal portion to me, a God-man.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="31" year="2008">In Colossians 3:16 Paul exhorted the believers in Colossae to sing with grace in their hearts when the word of Christ dwelt in them richly in all wisdom by their teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs. We are short in our experience of Christ because we do not sing that much with grace in our hearts. We do not have much experience of teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs. Mostly we sing only when we come together. We need to sing in our daily life. Perhaps a wife could sing to her husband, "All sufficient grace!/Never powerless!/It is Christ who lives in me,/In His exhaustlessness" (Hymns, #312). Then the husband can sing another chorus. If a husband says to his wife, "Dear, you should not give your long face to me so many times every day" the wife may say, "Then you should not come back home so late every day!" Instead of speaking in this corrupt way, the husbands and wives should sing and minister grace to each other.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="31" year="2008">We live by grace. The grace for the believers' living is spoken of in Romans 1:7 and in the beginning of all of Paul's other Epistles except Hebrews. In our Christian living, our daily life, we need the grace. Everyone has a problem with his temper. No one can overcome his temper except by grace. Who can be humble? We are always proud. We can be humble only by grace. The Lord said, "My grace is sufficient for you" (2 Cor. 12:9). "All sufficient grace!/Never powerless!" (Hymns, #312).

When circumstances arise to cause us to react, we have to tell ourselves to be quiet, be slow, and wait. We should not say anything or express any kind of attitude for a short time. Then the grace of God will be applied to us, and we will spontaneously become humble. Who can control his loose speaking? Some people speak quickly all the time. It is impossible to control our tongue without grace. Proverbs speaks repeatedly about the taming of the tongue. If we can control our tongue, we can reduce ninety percent of our sinfulness. The tongue can never be controlled by us in our own strength. We need the grace of God for overcoming in all the details of our daily living.

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="25" year="2008">This hymn concerning grace contains expressions that cannot be found in ordinary Christian books. What is grace? Grace is actually God Himself. Then what is God? God is the New Jerusalem. However, whether it is grace or God or the New Jerusalem, actually they are just one.
...
Since we are speaking concerning God's righteousness, why do we refer to a hymn on God's grace? My intention, my burden, is to show you that the entire Bible speaks of only one thing—grace, which is God, who is the New Jerusalem. Grace is the manifestation of the Triune God in His embodiment in three aspects—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Regardless of what subject the Bible touches, it is concerned with the Triune God in His embodiment in three aspects—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit—being manifested as grace consummating in the New Jerusalem. This is the highest and central revelation shown to us in the entire New Testament. Hence, we cannot touch the righteousness of God without touching grace. God's righteousness and God's grace are not two different things. Romans 5:17 refers to both the abundance of grace and the abundance of righteousness. Righteousness always accompanies grace and is its result.
