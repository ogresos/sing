This hymn really speaks to me at the moment.
Now I abhor myself.
"Look away unto Me"
I just cannot prevail.
"It is by My Spirit"
I am faithless, You're faithful still, 
Your love is stronger than my will.

So many times we think we can do things in ourselves, and we just fail. But praise the Lord we have this Wonderful One who is always there for us to turn to! Thank You Lord You love us so much, we want to love You more.</article>
