This hymns always reminds me of the 10 virgins and how I yearn to be part of the wise who had oil in their lamps and was able to meet the Bridegroom. Oh! Lord! Sisters and Brothers We need to burn now, we need the oil now not when we are dead and gone, we need to be awake.
The only thing that can keep us awake is just to burn brighter and wait on the Lord. Amen!!!</article>

	<article author="PcvH" email="" city="Sinacaban - Evansville" provst="Mis.Occ. - IN" country="" month="1" day="13" year="2010">In preparation for Christ's return, there's a need to fill oil and keep burning everyday that lamp may never dies until His coming back. There's a need to fill Jesus and gain a reserve supply all the way. 

This serves as my formula to be an OVERCOMER and to join with HIM in the wedding!</article>
