    <article author="Sarah" email="" city="Zamboanga City" provst="" country="Philippines" month="1" day="3" year="2010">My 4-yr old son Ezra Joseph (youngest of 3 kids) just loves this song so much. I make the music in hymnal.net as lullabye for my kids.

Ezra is always requesting for the song "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." Can't find it here. Can I request that it be included? Thanks so much. Amen.</article>
