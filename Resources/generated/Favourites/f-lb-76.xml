According to the summer training message, He's our master, we will not go out free because He's such an unique one—a master who's not coming to be served but to serve us. Through His serving, we are willing to humble ourselves and take Christ as our pattern to serve in the church life. Thank You Lord Jesus for taking on humanity and being such a pattern! I do love You.</article>

	<article author="Ernjay Kim" email="" city="Iligan City" provst="" country="Philippines" month="10" day="16" year="2010">It really touches my heart to love the Lord more. It moves me to its highest sense, to such an extent that I found myself crying. I don't know why, maybe because it reflects the story of my life (first two paragraphs) before. Until the time that the Lord revealed Himself. He is the great God, the highest One yet He took on humanity. He was hung on a tree. He died there just for me. I am a sinner yet He came for me. He bore all my sins. He is the eternal God yet He chose to be limited by time and space to save me. The Lord shows us how great His love toward us. He loved us to such an extent that He died for us.--That's why I love Him. That's why I treasure Him. That's why I give my life and all to Him.</article>
