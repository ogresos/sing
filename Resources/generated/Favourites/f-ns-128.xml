I'm heading for the NJ, where there is no need of the sun nor the moon, for the effulgence of the processed Triune God outshines the sun! Hallelujah. What a shining! Oh, to be so transparent!</article>
    <article author="Miri Fisher" city="Eugene" provst="Oregon" country="United States" month="4" day="28" year="2010">Amen! This song has become my experience and prayer in the last few days. I especially enjoy stanza two. We need to be emptied of our own will and mind and emotion, that we may be filled with Christ! Only then can we live Christ out in our daily living.</article>
    <article author="zoe" city="Waterloo" provst="Ontario" country="Canada" month="3" day="31" year="2009">I appreciate this song because it points out the need for us to be drawn by the Lord's beauty in order for our love for the world and the things of this world to fade away. We need to be those captured by a vision of our precious Lord, that we would be those "living His life as ours". :)</article>
