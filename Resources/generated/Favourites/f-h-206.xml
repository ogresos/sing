This hymn has seen me through Many storms yet the bridegroom remains altogether lovely. Read the
Letters of Samuel Rutherford, the author of this exquisite
Song, who was known for his profound love for Christ.</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Livonia" provst="MI" country="United States" month="3" day="15" year="2014">The original title of this hymn (more like a ballad of 19 stanzas) is "The Sands of Time are Sinking", inspired by the life of Samuel Rutherford (1600-1661) a pastor in the town of Anwoth, Scotland who was banished for his nonconformity and then wrote 365 letters, which Spurgeon held to be 'the nearest thing to inspiration that can be found in all the writings of mere man.' The name of the tune for this hymn is "Rutherford".
The 19th stanza refers to Rutherford's being charged with high treason, but his death intervened before he could be tried. His epitaph on his tombstone concluded "Aquainted with Immanuel's song."
Hymnal.net stanza 1 is the original 2nd stanza.
Hymnal.net stanza 2 is the original 15th stanza.
And Hymnal.net stanza 3 is the original 17th stanza (after the resurrection).
---------------------------------
1 The sands of time are sinking, 
  the dawn of heaven breaks;
The summer morn I’ve sighed for—
  the fair, sweet morn awakes:
Dark, dark hath been the midnight, 
 but dayspring is at hand,
And glory, glory dwelleth 
 in Immanuel’s land.
---------------------------
2 O Christ, He is the fountain,
  the deep, sweet well of love!
The streams of earth I’ve tasted 
  more deep I’ll drink above:
There to an ocean fullness
  His mercy doth expand,
And glory, glory dwelleth 
  in Immanuel’s land.
------------------------
3 Oh! Well it is forever, 
  Oh! well forevermore,
My nest hung in no forest 
  of all this death doomed shore:
Yea, let the vain world vanish, 
  as from the ship the strand,
While glory—glory dwelleth
 in Immanuel’s land.
---------------------
4 There the Red Rose of Sharon 
  unfolds its heartsome bloom
And fills the air of heaven 
  with ravishing perfume:
Oh! To behold it blossom, 
  while by its fragrance fanned
Where glory—glory dwelleth 
  in Immanuel’s land.
--------------------
5 The King there in His beauty, 
  without a veil is seen:
It were a well spent journey,
  though seven deaths lay between:
The Lamb with His fair army, 
  doth on Mount Zion stand,
And glory—glory dwelleth 
  in Immanuel’s land.
--------------------
6 Oft in yon sea beat prison 
  My Lord and I held tryst,
For Anwoth was not heaven, 
  and preaching was not Christ:
And aye, my murkiest storm cloud 
  was by a rainbow spanned,
Caught from the glory dwelling 
  in Immanuel’s land.
---------------------
7 But that He built a heaven 
  of His surpassing love,
A little new Jerusalem,
  like to the one above,
“Lord take me over the water” 
  hath been my loud demand,
Take me to my love’s own country, 
  unto Immanuel’s land.
---------------------------------
8 But flowers need nights cool darkness, 
  the moonlight and the dew;
So Christ, from one who loved it, 
  His shining oft withdrew:
And then, for cause of absence 
  my troubled soul I scanned
But glory shadeless shineth 
  in Immanuel’s land.
--------------------
9 The little birds of Anwoth, 
  I used to count them blessed,
Now, beside happier altars 
  I go to build my nest:
Over these there broods no silence, 
  no graves around them stand,
For glory, deathless, dwelleth 
  in Immanuel’s land.
---------------------
10 Fair Anwoth by the Solway, 
  to me thou still art dear,
Even from the verge of heaven, 
  I drop for thee a tear.
Oh! If one soul from Anwoth 
  meet me at God’s right hand,
My heaven will be two heavens, 
  In Immanuel’s land.
------------------
11 I’ve wrestled on t'wards heaven, 
  'gainst storm and wind and tide,
Now, like a weary traveler 
  that leaneth on his guide,
Amid the shades of evening, 
  while sinks life’s lingering sand,
I hail the glory dawning 
from Immanuel’s land.
------------------
12 Deep waters crossed life’s pathway, 
  the hedge of thorns was sharp;
Now, these lie all behind me 
  Oh! for a well tuned harp!
Oh! To join hallelujah 
  with yon triumphant band,
Who sing where glory dwelleth 
  in Immanuel’s land.
----------------------------
13 With mercy and with judgment 
  my web of time He wove,
And aye, the dews of sorrow 
  were lustered with His love;
I’ll bless the hand that guided, 
  I'll bless the heart that planned
When throned where glory dwelleth 
  in Immanuel’s land.
-----------------------------
14 Soon shall the cup of glory 
  wash down earth’s bitterest woes,
Soon shall the desert briar 
  break into Eden’s rose;
The curse shall change to blessing 
  the name on earth that’s banned
Be graven on the white stone 
  in Immanuel’s land.
---------------------
15 O I am my Beloved’s 
  and my Beloved’s mine!
He brings a poor vile sinner 
  into His “house of wine.”
I stand upon His merit—
  I know no other stand,
Not e'en where glory dwelleth 
  in Immanuel’s land.
----------------------------------
16 I shall sleep sound in Jesus, 
  filled with His likeness rise,
To love and to adore Him, 
  to see Him with these eyes:
’Tween me and resurrection 
  but Paradise doth stand;
Then—then for glory dwelling 
  in Immanuel’s land.
--------------------------
17 The Bride eyes not her garment, 
  but her dear Bridegroom’s face;
I will not gaze at glory 
  but on my King of grace.
Not at the crown He giveth 
  but on His pierced hand;
The Lamb is all the glory 
  of Immanuel’s land.
------------------------------
18 I have borne scorn and hatred, 
  I have borne wrong and shame,
Earth’s proud ones have reproached me 
  for Christ’s thrice blessed Name:
Where God His seal set fairest 
  they’ve stamped the foulest brand,
But judgment shines like noonday 
  in Immanuel’s land.
-------------------------------
19 They’ve summoned me before them, 
  but there I may not come,
My Lord says “Come up hither,” 
  My Lord says “Welcome home!”
My King, at His white throne, 
  my presence doth command
Where glory—glory dwelleth 
  in Immanuel’s land.</article>
	<article author="Salvador Z. Tarun, Jr." email="salvadorztarun@gmail.com" city="Pittsburgh" provst="PA" country="United States" month="10" day="5" year="2013">This hymn deeply resonates in my heart --- sweet, pure, profound, eternal. An apt offering of sweet aroma to our dear Beloved who gave His life for us. A marriage song for our Universal Bridegroom.</article>
	<article author="Tom H Walker" email="tomhwalker@telus.net" city="Comox" provst="BC" country="Canada" month="9" day="29" year="2013">That song was sung many times in Toronto and in Vancouver where I met over many years with some beloved brothers and sisters. Now many years later I offered it by email this day to a brother through whom I was invited to his native India in 2002. Now I am impelled by the Lord to return to India for my 16th visit. The central theme of the message the Lord has put on my heart is contained in verse 3 - 'The Bride eyes not her garment, But her dear Bridegroom's face... Now our dear Bridegroom is at the very doors!</article>
	<article author="Samuel Hall" email="" city="Camuy" provst="" country="Puerto Rico" month="7" day="23" year="2011">I will be using this hymn in my wedding in 1 week, and I'm enjoying Christ as my deep sweet well of life! 

To brother Samuel Frank Diaz: your comment is very touching. Although I can't empathize with your loss, your faith and eternal hope in the Lord are a real supply and encouragement to me. I feel insufficient in being able to supply you with words of my own, so I would like to share with you the following: 

  "His grace is all-sufficient
   As by His wisdom planned."

Keep gazing on the King of grace, brother.

Your brother in Christ,
Sam Hall</article>
	<article author="Samuel Frank Diaz" email="" city="Yorktown Heights" provst="New York" country="United States" month="5" day="6" year="2010">I woke up 2 hours earlier than usual today. Immediately I started planning my day thinking I have a real jump start.
I've recently lost my wife to cancer, although it's been 8 months I'm still surprised when I don't see her in the morning. I miss that morning hug and "hi babe."

This morning I'm enjoying that morning hug with Our Beloved Bridegroom and King of grace.

I want to spend more time gazing at Him and enjoying His wonderful presence.

I heard this song many years ago (1970) at Elden Hall in Los Angeles. Someone shouted out "SISTERS." All these women rose to their feet and started singing this song and it had to be one of the most memorable moments of my life. To put the icing on the cake a sister than shouted out "BROTHERS." The sisters sat down; the brothers stood up to sing and I realized I'm a sister also!! We all rose together for the last verse and I'm not kidding I thought we were going to sing it again right at the throne.

Thank You Lord Jesus that after so many years "You're still the One!!</article>
	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="8" day="25" year="2009">God's dealing with His redeemed people through the Trinity was for the purpose of keeping them in the enjoyment of His riches through His divine dispensing. Without the Angel of Jehovah, Jehovah had no way to go with them in their midst. For Jehovah to be with His people, there was the need of the Angel. Today without Christ, God has no way to be with us. Furthermore, the cloud and the pillar of cloud were necessary for God to come to His people and stay with them. Similarly, today the Spirit, the pneumatic Christ, enables God to come to us and stay with us so that we may enjoy His presence. The crucified Christ as the cleft rock is our standing and hiding before the manifested God. Hymns, #298 says, "On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand; / All other ground is sinking sand." Hymns, #206 says, "I stand upon His merit; / I know no other stand." Because the crucified Christ, Christ in His death, is our standing and our hiding, we can communicate with and contact God. The merciful and governmental God and the rebellious, stiff-necked people can be brought together only through the Angel, the pillar of cloud, the cleft rock, and the hand of Jehovah, which typify Christ as God's sent One, the pneumatic Christ, Christ in His death, and Christ as the covering in God's manifestation. Because of the operation of the Trinity in this way, we now enjoy God's continual presence. Moreover, He manifests Himself to us, and we see Him in a hidden way. We have a standing and a hiding, a covering. This all-inclusive care of the Divine Trinity is for the purpose of His remaining with us to dispense Himself for our enjoyment.
