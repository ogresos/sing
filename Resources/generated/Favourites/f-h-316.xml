She and he recently concluded their 50th anniversary in Hawaii, US and visited their daughter in celebration to share their joy. She took a hot tub soak, asking to fill the water with foam for a picture which her husband took. When he showed the family in the house all cam to congratulate her and she had expired in the interim in the tub, floating under water. God took her silently and quickly. Joy and sorrow often hug each other in such a simple and sudden departure to His Glorious Presence.</article>
