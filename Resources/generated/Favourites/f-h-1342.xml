    <article author="Dan Mackenzie" email="tumbleweed@eotnet.net" city="Hermiston" provst="Oregon" country="United States" month="5" day="16" year="2013">As a retired pastor, I would like to gently point out to Cam that the Old Testament is an important and still valid part of the Christian Bible, and informs our Christian faith. Jesus quoted the Old Testament extensively, as did Paul, John, Luke and other New Testament writers. As to songs, the book of Psalms provides the inspiration and even the contents of many Christian hymns.</article>
    <!--article author="Cam" email="ridethecamel@gmail.com" city="Oasis" provst="Barren" country="Disputed Territory" month="12" day="16" year="2012">Oh but Penny, I dare say this is not a Christian hymn. This is a Jewish song, straight out of the Old Testament. It is a prophecy of how the Jews will one day will be gathered again, from every corner of the globe, to Zion (Israel), in the height of Zion (Jerusalem), and how they, (and even their sheep and goats!) shall sing and rejoice that they once again are in their homeland and possess their homeland and can protect themselves and can dwell in safety from the persecution that they have received virtually everywhere else on this globe. Of this prophecy, we have seen the essential fulfillment beginning with the creation of the State of Israel in 1948. Although it is a Jewish hymn (probably a Christian put these words to this music), I think if a Christian or a Muslim's heart is right, he should be able to rejoice with them. And with God.</article-->
