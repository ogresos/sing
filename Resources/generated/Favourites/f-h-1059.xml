It's such a great timeless gospel hymn!! I remember singing it in church! I'm glad I was able to find it here!! Yes indeed we are closer everyday to the coming of our Lord Jesus!! Let's keep praying witnessing and encouraging one another in the body of Christ!!</article>
	<article author="Estaeheli" email="estaeheli@gmail.com" city="Spokane" provst="Washington" country="United States" month="1" day="23" year="2016">Maybe this song was translated into another language, then back to English. It's close enough. All the verses are beautiful and wonderful. We can sing every one of them in praise to God for the peace that lies just beyond. Hallelujah brethren, we are very close to the Eternal Kingdom!</article>

	<article author="Blair Chitimbe" email="bchitimbe@gmail.com" city="Blantyre" provst="" country="Malawi" month="11" day="6" year="2014">The significance of the Cross in our Christian lives cannot be over emphasized, to be victorious one has to choose the Cross without hesitation. Jesus Christ died for all believers; what is important to make a closer step each day towards the golden strand with the Messiah by your side in order to attain the peaceful rest beyond that river.</article>
	<article author="Favor" email="designotionltd@gmail.com" city="Lagos" provst="" country="Nigeria" month="10" day="22" year="2014">The original words of the hymn are deeply inspiring. The fourth stanza states -
Near the cross I'll watch and wait,
Hoping Trusting Ever
Till I reach the golden strand,
Just beyond the river.

And the chorus states-
In the cross, in the cross
Be my glory ever
Till my raptured soul shall find
Rest beyond the river.</article>

	<article author="Mark Sidney" email="mesidney@frontiernet.net" city="New Douglas" provst="IL" country="" month="4" day="9" year="2014">I love this hymn! But where did you find your version of the chorus. It doesn't come from Fanny Crosby who wrote the song. Just wondering. When I did our church bulletin for tonight I did not catch that difference in time. And I do prefer Fanny Crosby's word. God bless.</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="3" day="18" year="2013">This is another Fanny Crosby/William Doane collaboration. In this case, Doane's tune came first, and Crosby's words after. When hymns are composed in this way, the words sometimes seem stilted and unnatural, but not here. Crosby was masterful at hearing the message in the music. She would often say, "That tune says to me ...,", and then write a stirring text. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>

	<article author="Barbara Smith" email="" city="Gold Coast" provst="Queensland" country="Australia" month="9" day="20" year="2011">In reply to last posting, someone has just this evening given me a sheet from a hymnbook and the words are slightly different (Number 312 in this particular book).

For example the last two lines of the chorus are:

"Till my raptured soul shall find
Rest beyond the river"

and the fourth verse finishes with 
"Till I reach the golden strand
Just beyond the river"

If these sound familiar I am sure you can find this version. I just don't have the name of the hymnal.</article>

	<article author="Francis Alphonse" email="" city="Auckland" provst="" country="New Zealand" month="5" day="4" year="2009">I played this song at mass recently and was somewhat surprised it wasn't well known by the congregation.

No matter, they'll learn if I keep playing it ! Its a lovely melody and the lyrics really do reach out in prayer.

As was done for Fanny, I'd like someone to play this at my funeral. I'd want to leave with words like these

God bless</article>
