Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus. Who, existing in the form of God, did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross. Therefore also God highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name, that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue should openly confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father. Praise the Lord!!</article>

When I look unto Jesus and see His God-man living, I have no more complaints on my situation. Instead of looking into myself and try to console myself, I learned to look unto, see, and worship Jesus in every situation.

What a Father-Son-Spirit Triune God-man! His life is perfect, so God has full grounds to raise Him. Praise the Lord for "this One" who is resurrected, ascended, and now lives in my spirit!</article>
    <article author="Eugene Liu" email="" city="Hong Kong" provst="" country="China" month="2" day="17" year="2008">I like this song because it tells me what kind of person Jesus is: gentle and lowly is His heart, tender sweet, balanced in every way, complete, no outward beauty to display, and faithful, wise to the Father's will. And thus God exalted Him, given Him glory and majesty.

Amen, I love such a Christ, I worship Him.</article>
    <article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="31" year="2008">There was a human living on this earth not just by man but by God in man. This was God's living in humanity. In Christ's human living, the divine life was mingled with the human life. In the previous message on God's incarnation, we saw that the purpose of the incarnation was to mingle God with man that God and man might be one. We can see the mingling of God and man in the type of the meal offering (Lev. 2:4). Stanza 5 of Hymns, #86 says, "Thou as a man art tender, sweet,/Balanced in every way, complete,/Meal-offering to the Father meet;/Lord, I remember Thee!" In the meal offering, there were two elements. One element was the fine flour made of wheat. The other element was the olive oil. The meal offering was made of fine flour mingled with oil. The word mingle means to combine two elements together to be one entity without a third element being produced. The two elements are combined together, but they still remain distinguishable. God and man are mingled together as one, but they still remain distinguishable.
