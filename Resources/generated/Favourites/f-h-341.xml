	<article author="Dane" email="daneincalif@hotmail.com" city="Fresno" provst="CA" country="United States" month="4" day="22" year="2016">I have lost 5 family members from cancer over the last couple of years. One being my other half. 
I went to sleep last night feeling sad and lonely. But woke up with the words it is well with my soul. So I typed it in. 
I listed to the first song that came up. It was the song with the author and his story. I knew then that God was reaching his arms around me. 
Then I scrolled down and read the comments left. They inspired and feed my soul. 
I will say when I am lonely and missing my love and family to say
     "it is well with my soul" 
and know His love wraps me, His hands carry me, and forgiveness is endless.</article>

I lost my elder sister on the 10th of this month, on the 16th, my immediate elder sister reported her two girls aged between 10 and 12 years missing in Abuja. By the grace of God they were found the next day by a Good Samaritan, 15 kilometers in Nassarawa State, while we were rejoicing and thanking God for His faithfulness, we got the most shocking news, the next day 17th, of the murder in Abuja of my niece's husband. The family is in shock, all these happening in quick succession, in less than two weeks. The feelings of pain, agony, despondent, but the word of God comes strong, very strong and alive in this situation and times, that He will never leave nor forsake us. This song is all I keep singing, and it lifts my spirit. In all situation an circumstance we find ourself, we are required to always give thanks and praise to God, for He is the all knowing God.

	<article author="Rachel" email="fivehowells@gmail.com" city="Visalia" provst="CA" country="United States" month="1" day="2" year="2013">About the author, Horatio G. Spafford:

In November 1873, Spafford decided to take his entire family to Europe for a vacation, intending also to assist Moody in his evangelistic work once he arrived there. However, Spafford was unexpectedly detained in Chicago due to urgent business concerns, but decided to send his family aboard the S.S. Ville du Harve as scheduled. Midway through the trans-Atlantic voyage, S.S. Ville du Harve was struck by the English vessel Loch Earn and eventually foundered. Spafford's four daughters‚ÄîAnna, eleven; Maggie, nine; Bessie, seven; and Tanetta, two‚Äîwere among the 226 who perished in the aftermath. Mrs. Spafford, one of the few who were spared, sent her husband the heartbreaking telegram: ‚ÄúSaved alone.‚Äù

Spafford immediately sailed for England to join his grief-stricken wife. As his ship passed the approximate location where his daughters had drowned, his deep sorrow mingled with his unwavering faith in God's goodness caused him to compose the hymn, "It Is Well."</article>

	<article author="Ben Huxford" email="" city="Liverpool" provst="Merseyside" country="United Kingdom" month="9" day="4" year="2012">We sing this hymn at church, and I think the tune is great, but more importantly the words.</article>
	<article author="Kim" email="" city="Toledo" provst="OH" country="United States" month="6" day="7" year="2012">I recently had something unpleasant happen. As I was praying to God a gentle voice whispered, "All is well with my soul." I'd never even heard these lyrics until today. I believe that what God is saying to me is that whatever happens in this life that He's there and He's in control and that He has His hands on us. No matter what we go through in this life, nothing can compare to the glory that awaits the person who belongs to Christ. Because of this promise, we may always, no matter what our circumstances look like, say with assurance that All IS WELL WITH MY SOUL.</article>

	<article author="Hugh Brown" email="" city="Accra" provst="" country="Ghana" month="4" day="3" year="2010">This is a hymn that always touches the inner core of my soul, and encourages me to praise the Lord even during difficult times. It is a hymn borne out of excruciating loss and pain, but also a deep relationship and knowledge of the Lord. It encourages me to declare just like the Apostle Paul " Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? .... Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us. For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things to come, nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord." (Romans 8:35, 37-39)</article>
	<article author="RISELDA" email="" city="Lakewood" provst="California" country="United States" month="12" day="8" year="2009">We would like to borrow the notes in the midst of the lost of our beloved Ericson saying,
We are able to maintain our faith in the face of such devastating bereavement without spiritual faltering.
As we are confronted with such senseless tragedy would surely be to question, to doubt, to blame, to accuse God. By His grace we have been graced by God to mourn without bitterness, to sorrow without anger, to trust without resentment, to rest in the peace of Christ which surpasses every man's understanding (Phil. 4:6). We maintain the precious faith allotted to all the believers (2 Peter 1:1) which enables us to believe steadfastly that all things work together for good to those who love God and to those who are called according to His purpose (Rom. 8:28).</article>
	<article author="Colleen" email="" city="Johannesburg" provst="Gauteng" country="South Africa" month="10" day="2" year="2009">After being financially strained for the past three months and expecting our first child I thank the Lord for inspiring this song to be written. Often I asked myself why but I understand God has a reason for His glory to be seen all the time. Many have lost their lives during these times but the Lord has been on my side and not a single day have I been diagnosed of high blood pressure or defects on my child or my marriage broken. Thank You Lord.</article>

	<article author="Dinah Jabian" email="" city="San Pedro" provst="Laguna, phils" country="Philippines" month="12" day="19" year="2008">Yes, really if we love the Lord then we can only say "AMEN Lord." All things work together for good to those all who love Him (Rom. 8:28).
In our own its not easy to accept trials especially when it comes to losing our loved ones. I remember last year in June 2008 my close cousin got sick. His kidney was already acute so all doctors refused to treat him. When it was confirm that he'll no longer be healed unless with miracles all of us at home came to be hopeless. We really can do nothing but to pray. The whole church with other nearby churches prayed for him. During the prayer meeting at home we also prayed and at same time all of us were shedding tears. But we know that we cannot stop what the Lord wants, if that is His will let it be done. What happen should happen. This young brother died at 21 old. His last word before He died is OH LORD JESUS and he breathed his last breath. Although we were not able to witnessed his burial as we live here in Manila, it's all fine. Prayers make us united. Really all is well to our soul. The Lord can bear all things that we can't.
I just miss him and I know one day we will be with him and with Christ. Amen.</article>

I pray this generation and those to come find solace in God and in His unchanging word of truth. Amen.</article>
	<article author="Michael Pearce" email="" city="" provst="Wellington" country="New Zealand" month="7" day="27" year="2008">Through much difficulty and trial during the last 7 years of chronic sickness hymns like this and Rock of Ages have been of tremendous encouragement to me. I'm in my 30's and have a wife and 2 (soon to be 3) beautiful kids. I can only imagine the grief of losing a child let alone all your children, each is so precious. Praise the Lord that He cares more for our children that we do ourselves. Let us look to Him the Author and Perfector of our faith for eternal encouragement and peace during difficult times and all the more as we see the day of the Lord approaching.</article>

Surely, it is well with my soul.</article>

	<article author="L Sue Meyer" email="" city="Old Bridge" provst="NJ" country="U.S.A." month="2" day="18" year="2004">I was brought up in the Bible belt in Alabama. My parents did not always agree, hence the three divorces from each other. They even went on to marry others. Mother had three husbands under her belt, one she buried. Father has had four wives all ending in divorces. I married a Navy man. His first ship was the USS Stark FFG 31. That was the ship that was hit by two Iranian missiles. He had gotten off six miths before the disaster. He knew 39 of the 41 killed. His rack was distroyed. Not long after that my husband's mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. It went from one breast to the other, to her lungs, to her spine, and finally she had a brain tumor. I always told her when I talked to her that I was praying for her. She gave me the best compliment. Before she died she accepted the Lord because she said I had witnessed to her by my actions since I had married her son. Mom was dead just after her 49th birthday after a five year battle. Through all this I remember the song saying 'whatever my lot, it is well with my soul.' After hearing the history of this song (which I wish you provided to others), I knew that no matter what happens in my life, God is there to help make it well in my soul. I just have to give it over to Him which is never an easy task. We all want to have that control, but if we give the control to the Lord then He will make it right.</article>
