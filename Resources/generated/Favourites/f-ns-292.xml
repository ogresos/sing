	<article author="Marj Alberto" email="" city="Manila" provst="Laguna" country="Philippines" month="12" day="7" year="2010">Praise the Lord! :) This is one of my childhood favorite song. I had been singing this song as part of the children's meeting and yes at that time I could not fully understand what the lyrics really mean, but when I sang this in my YP days, it has touched my heart and as I sang the song this morning, YES I AM MADE TO BE FILLED WITH THE LORD AND THAT THE WORLD CANNOT PROMISE ME MORE THAN WHAT THE LORD AND HIS KINGDOM DOES TO ME! :)</article>
	<article author="AC" email="" city="" provst="" country="Canada" month="11" day="29" year="2010">What a sweet hymn to sing, especially for our younger generation. I remember singing this song in the children's meetings but it didn't mean much to me then. Now when I sing this hymn I realize that it is such an honor and a privilege to give our lives to the Lord. Life is not worth living a day for things that will soon pass away because we are made to be filled with the Lord! May we all follow the Lamb wherever He may go.</article>

Hallelujah!There's nothing that compares to my destiny. Praise the Lord He is my future and my destiny. I love You Jesus more and more each day!!!</article>
	<article author="Arnel Marcial" email="" city="Palm Jumeira" provst="Dubai" country="United Arab Emirates" month="9" day="17" year="2009">I love this hymn so much because when I heard this hymn it reminds me about my hope and my destiny. 'Nor its life worth living a day and the things that will soon pass away. It doesn't matter how rich or successful I'll be or how many things be offered to me, there's nothing compared to my destiny. Sometimes when we are tempted by the strategy of Satan in this world, especially if the world offered us everything we feel that we are very far from the Lord. Just remember saints of what Moses said, that all things will be gone and we will soon fly away. That's why our hope and destiny is the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</article>
