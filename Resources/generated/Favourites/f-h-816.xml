Hence, "Godâ€™s own Word must not be taken just as knowledge but as life" (cf. stanza 1). If we read God's Word (the Bible) just for knowledge, we need to remember "....for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life" (2 Cor. 3:6b), and we are like Eve, taking of the tree of knowledge. Lord, my our eyes be opened to see that we need to come to Your Word in spirit and reality, to take (eat) of the tree of life!</article>
