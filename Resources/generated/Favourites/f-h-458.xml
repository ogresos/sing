	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="5" day="14" year="2016">Charles was converted at the early age of 12 in his home town of Lafayette, Indiana. He married his childhood sweetheart and was ordained by the Methodist Episcopal Church. He felt called to the work of an evangelist, and after their daughter was born, he was often out alone on evangelistic tours. Upon returning home one time, his wife announced that this way was not for her. She wanted the broad way, the bright lights, and the life of excitement. In spite of his pleading that he would stay at home and take a pastorate, she left him and took their little daughter to Los Angeles. There she burned out her life in sin and shame. Less than 5 years later she sent their daughter to find him. "Try to find your father and ask him to pray for me." However, the wretched woman died before their daughter could find her father. 
Sometime after the sad death of his wife, Charles wrote the hymn, "No One Ever Cared for Me Like Jesus." It was his greatest hymn. A hymn he wrote later, which tells something of his own experience, is "I have found a hiding place." - Hymn Stories by Wilbur Konkel</article>
