	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="11" day="12" year="2015">"Different hymns have a way of fitting themselves into people's lives and into religious services in certain ways. In a typical Wednesday night prayer meeting, this hymn is often sung just before the congregation prays. As a matter of fact, it's called a 'prayer song'. It's another one of those simple, straightforward old gospel hymns that points up the feeling folks have of wanting to be close to the Higher Person. And when you sing this song it's a close feeling you do get, a comfortable feeling. They say confession is good for the soul - this is a confession by a true believer that he needs divine help and guidance, needs it every hour of every day." - Tennessee Ernie Ford (1919-91)
Ernie's rendition has just verses 1,2 and 5:
1st verse: Male solo voice
Refrain: Choir in unison
2nd verse: Female solo voice
Refrain: Soprano-alto duet
5th verse: All voices in unison
Refrain: Women's voices on melody. Men's on cued notes.

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="1" day="13" year="2013">This hymn was written by an ordinary 37 year old housewife from Brooklyn, NY. Annie Hawks was busy with her household chores when the words came to her. She later wrote, "I was so filled with a sense of nearness to my Master that, wondering how one could live without Him in either joy or pain, these words, 'I need thee every hour,' were flashed into my mind. Seating myself by the open window in the balmy air of the bright June day, I caught up my pencil and the words were soon committed to paper."

Hawks reflected, "It was not until years later, when the shadow fell over my way, the shadow of a great loss, that I understood something of the comforting power in the words." God often allows us to learn in the sunshine what we will need to lean on in the darkness. - Great Songs of Faith by Brown and Norton.</article>

	<article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="3" day="26" year="2008">Surely every hour we need Him. From hour to hour we do not know what situations will confront us. We may say hallelujah or amen in the meeting, but when we get home, our joy may vanish, and instead of hallelujah and amen there will be silence and a long face. A problem has arisen. Or we may get chilled and catch cold. Whatever the problem, Christ is there taking care of our case. He bears us when we have a long face or are ill. His interceding never ceases. His ability to take care of us is unlimited because He is the almighty God. His priesthood is an interceding ministry in the heavens, in the Holy of Holies, before God for us.
