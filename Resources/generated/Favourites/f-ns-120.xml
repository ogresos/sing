	<article author="Jacob" email="echad@ausi.com" city="Frazers Creak" provst="NSW" country="Australia" month="9" day="14" year="2013">My Heart says this is very Beautiful Spiritual Song. Thank you.
Seeking is a doing word, we put forward the desire to become more alike Him, by allowing Him to change us within our hearts, little by little, day by day, seeking His Righteousness leads us to His Kingdom. It’s interesting that it says Seek “First” and not just to seek. Thus it was written “You shall seek me, and find me”, when you search for me, with all your heart”. Asking and Knocking are doing words also. 
With tears in my eyes, I ask our Father in Heaven, that I may be transformed little by little, day by day, as He leads me to see how he wants me to change, I ask not for myself but that I may love others more, as according to His word, I also “knock” by reminding Him that “he promised” us that “we will find him”. Therefore I pray for the right intention to seek first His Kingdom and His Character, with my whole heart.

	<article author="Bob" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="2" day="26" year="2013">I was reading Luke 12:13-31 (parable of the rich fool) and thought of this hymn.
The key is to understand the Hebrew word translated 'righteousness' - 'tzedakah'. The rich man should have sought after God's righteousness/charity/equality by sharing his wealth with orphans, widows and foreigners rather than keeping it to himself. May His kingdom come and may we be those who bring it forward. Deut. 15:7-11; Deut. 26:12; Deut. 27:19; James 1:27.</article>

Not on a material things, because things we do see is temporal, but we seek His righteousness, also to grow in the knowledge of Him, and this is Spiritual things, things we cannot see, but is eternal. Oh how I long to see that wonderful day, when we but only pilgrims and strangers on this present situation. But good news to those who call upon the Name of the Lord Jesus, we are no longer foreigner and strangers, but fellow citizens with the saints, and members of the household of GOD. Having built upon the foundation of Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief conerstone. And we are being joined together, grows as a holy temple in the Lord. And we also are being built together for a habitation of GOD in the Spirit.</article>
