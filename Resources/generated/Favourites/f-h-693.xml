This song is in my spirit today too, God's response to all I have been speaking to Him about all of our situations in the earth. If we have God whom need we fear.

Praise be to our God.amen.</article>
    <article author="L M" email="lmanifold@gmail.com" city="Austin" provst="Texas" country="United States" month="5" day="23" year="2013">I woke up this morning troubled about my responsibility in an upcoming church-sponsored event. The night before I told those coordinating that what we were trying to do was "impossible, too much, beyond our ability" ... This song was in my spirit as God's response!</article>
    <article author="Hymnal.Net" city="" provst="" country="" month="4" day="9" year="2008">Whether young or old, all of us must exercise to do one thing: from the time we wake up in the morning until we go to bed at night, as long as we are awake and breathing, we must set our minds on the Lord. Perhaps you would say, "I want to do this. But whenever I become busy, I forget about this." I admit that sometimes I forget the Lord also. But one thing which I have learned makes it hard for me to forget the Lord: I always call on the Lord. If you would call "O Lord" all the time, you will be reminded of Him. Sometimes you also have to learn to say "Amen." Many times we become busy with something. While we are busy with that thing, we become buried in it for two or three hours. The Lord is gone, and we are lost in that thing. I have learned a secret: no matter how busy I am, I would learn always to say, "O Lord, amen." This kind of calling brings me into fellowship with the Lord.

Some of you drive to work. While you are driving you can call on the Lord. Sometimes the road is too congested. The cars ahead of you are moving too slowly. At such times you have to exercise yourself to say, "O Lord, amen." You may even joke a little, "O Lord, the cars are slow. But You are not slow." The Lord is indeed not slow. He never fails us. If your mind is turned, the songs will come: "He faileth not, for He is God; He faileth not, His grace how good!" If you have such a good enjoyment during the day, you will surely love to come to the meetings. If all the brothers and sisters would live such a life, everyone would surely love the home meetings.
