	<article author="Eunice Garcia" email="eunicegarcia76@gmail.com" city="" provst="NY" country="United States" month="4" day="7" year="2015">My prayer: Lord make this day count in Your eyes... 
I repent of wasted time. We must pay the price to buy the oil in order for our vessels to be filled! Just keep coming to Him again and again and again.... Every morning of each day... Do not allow your time to be usurped.
"Oh, let us not return to sloth and folly,
 But jealously His loving presence hold".</article>
	<article author="Johanna" email="" city="" provst="" country="" month="11" day="25" year="2012">This is a beautiful song and helps one to think about the things that really matter. I'm curious as to who the author of the lyrics is. Would someone happen to know?</article>
	<article author="Sharon Rose M. Tabugo" email="" city="Iligan City" provst="Lanao Del Norte" country="Philippines" month="6" day="3" year="2012">This song indeed makes me cry. Oh, what a rest, what joy, what love, what favor to be HIs Bride when He comes to HIs feast. It will be a GLORIOUS DAY to be with our dear Bridegroom, a day that would last for eternity. I wanted to get married Lord, but I want to be Your Bride. I long for Your appearing. When I see Your glorious face I will seize that moment and make it last for eternity. I am nothing without You. That is why I long for that grandeur to be with You; a part of Your dear BRIDE on the wedding day.</article>
	<article author="Samuel Y." email="" city="Arlington" provst="TX" country="United States" month="8" day="9" year="2011">I first heard this song after a major surgery when I was in the greatest pain. It reminded me that the most important thing is to gain more oil at every opportunity. One year later, I sang this song at a high school conference on "the kingdom". I realized that everything in the world is waste in comparison to the kingdom of the heavens. We should gain the Lord at every opportunity and overcome the world and our soul life so that we do not miss out on the one thousand year wedding feast. Otherwise, we will be in the outer darkness for one thousand years regretting that we did not take every opportunity to overcome. Saints, we should become overcomers during our lifetime in this age, instead of the one thousand years in the next.</article>

	<article author="Aliki Reddy" email="" city="Athens" provst="" country="Greece" month="11" day="23" year="2009">The time is now. Enjoy Him now. Love Him more now. Waste yourself on Him now.

It will simply be the fullness of what we are already enjoying.</article>

In Him,

Yes satisfied, Christ and His Bride together...
