	<article author="Frederick Edward Woodworth" email="fwoodworth@btinternet.com" city="Sittingbourne" provst="Kent" country="United Kingdom" month="4" day="7" year="2016">One of the few hymns I find almost impossible to sing. One, because my vocal range doesn't stretch that far, but mainly because the words - wonderful, moving words, get my emotions going, especially those of the second verse. I'm glad there's nobody here at my computer as I read the words or sing it in my mind. Emotion is a taboo subject especially for a retired man in his mid-sixties. On the few occasions it's been sung in our church, I've been able to do no more than to mouth the words with not one syllable passing my lips.</article>

I've recorded a piano version with an accompanying orchestra arrangement in soundcloud that you can search by the title. 
I cannot tell why He whom angels worship.</article>

	<article author="Ilona Vadaszi" email="ilona.vadaszi.7@facebook.com" city="Budpest" provst="" country="Hungary" month="10" day="16" year="2015">I LIKE THIS SONG VERY MUCH, I WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING MORE ABOUT THE WRITER. I KNOW IT IN HUNGARIAN LANGUAGE, I CAN WRITE IT TO YOU.
iT IS: 
1. Miért, hogy Ő, kit angyalének dicsért, Költötte ránk szerelme kincseit? Vagy mint a pásztor elveszett után járt, Elmémmel fel nem foghatom, miét? De azt tudom, hogy Máriától származott, Hogy Betlehemben jászol ágya volt, Hogy Názáretben élt és ott volt otthona, Ím így jött el Ő, a világ Megváltója.
2. Nem érthetem, miért szenvedett némán. Békéje fénylik Golgota hegyén, Szíve miért szakadt meg a kereszten, Tövisből mért kapott ott koronát? De azt tudom, hogy megtört szívek orvosa, Bűn, félelem tüzét megoltja Ő, Megterhelt lélek láncait leoldja, Ezért jött el Ő, a világ Megváltója.
3. Miképpen hódolnak előtte népek, Hogy kormányozza földi birtokát, Kelet-nyugatnak, bűnösnek s a bölcsnek Szomját hogy oltja, meg nem mondhatom. De azt tudom, hogy dicsősége felragyog, Hogy amit Ő vet, Ő aratja majd; Győzelme napja nem sokáig várat, Megismerik Őt, a világ Megváltóját.
4. Miképpen áldja Őt magát majd a föld, Ha egy szaván a béke lesz az Úr, Vagy sejted-é az ujjongásnak árját, Ha minden szívet lénye majd betölt? De azt tudom, hogy angyalének ujjong, Megváltott lelkek hangja zengi Őt, Az ég a földnek, föld az égnek mondja: Végre Király Ő, a világ Megváltója!</article>
	<article author="Claire Withers" email="clairehope@aol.com" city="Sandbach" provst="Cheshire" country="United Kingdom" month="6" day="16" year="2015">First sang this in the early 90s and loved it. Nearly 10 years later, totally by chance, it was sung at my daughter's Christening. I looked out at the congregation and saw the tears flooding down my father's face. His father suffered the horrors of the trenches 1915-1918. I think "and stays our sin and calms our lurking fear" were particularly relevant to a them both. I am a hopeful, rather than a convinced Christian. Singing these incredible words, to that wonderful tune with my child in my arms and the loving face of my father (now departed) before me, for a few moments I felt the force of it as a reality. Each time I read this I feel it anew. May we all come to see a day "when all the hearts of men with love are filled".</article>
	<article author="Maria Theresa Mc Conville" email="maria-mcconville@hotmail.co.uk" city="Belfast" provst="" country="" month="4" day="24" year="2015">Thank you so much! I have to sing it at a funeral tomorrow. The lyrics actually reduced me to tears.</article>
	<article author="Mary Arnold" email="mtarnold@nni.com" city="Philadelphia" provst="Pennsylvania" country="United States" month="3" day="25" year="2015">Every note reaches into the soul. This was sung at a family funeral recently. He was a man who had grown up bearing the cross of special needs. He never went to prom, dated, drove a car, those things we take for granted. May he find all he lacked in this life, countless times over in Heaven.</article>
	<article author="Maiyo" email="wilsonmaiyo@yahoo.com" city="Nairobi" provst="" country="Kenya" month="9" day="22" year="2014">This is a great hymn/carol with a beautiful tune and lovely lyrics. I love to sing it!</article>
	<article author="Anonymous" email="" city="" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="9" day="18" year="2014">We sang this at my husband's funeral recently. The first part was sung by a talented singer and the refrain was joined by over 200 people. It felt like a foretaste of heaven!</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="7" day="1" year="2014">As a young Baptist minister, Fullerton conducted evangelistic missions in many parts of the British Isles. In 1912 he became Home Secretary of the Baptist Missionary Society in England. He was a co-worker of Charles Spurgeon and became a pastor at Melbourne Hall, Leicester. - Songs of the Spirit by Martin

I remember singing this hymn to this tune with my own congregation years ago. Hey it's so good that He never changes, "But this I know" He is as faithful today as ever He was. 
Maybe we will sing this in heaven, but the words will be wrong because then we shall know why. x</article>
	<article author="Colin Amey" email="colin.amey@btinternet.com" city="Bournemouth" provst="Dorset" country="United Kingdom" month="3" day="23" year="2014">What a song. Someone else comments "it can break the heart of a strong man" and yes, was moved to tears in church today singing this. Not sure why, maybe because of its honesty, as we realise there are many unknown factors in our walk with God, but then it focuses us on the core truths of who Jesus is, what He has done and what He will achieve. Great song of hope. Takes me back to teens as well, maybe realising for the first time some of these great truths.</article>
	<article author="Gill Delano" email="gillian_delano@sky.com" city="" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="8" day="11" year="2013">I love the whole hymn especially: But this I know, He heals the broken-hearted,
  And stays our sin, and calms our lurking fear,
And lifts the burden from the heavy laden...thank You Father for sending us Jesus!</article>
	<article author="Okunnuga Bayonle Tosin" email="baok13@ymail.com" city="Ikeja" provst="Lagos" country="Nigeria" month="6" day="3" year="2013">Apart from the text of the hymn, the tune is one that can break the heart of a strong man and with the text, whaooo... Αм forever blessed that the Saviour of the world is here.</article>

I was converted at 10:30am on Saturday 19th of July 1999. A few months later a woman asked me how I was feeling. I asked her how she thought a man who was in love should feel. She didn't understand fully what I meant, but that love is making my heart melt as I type.</article>
	<article author="Kathryn" email="kathinchina@yahoo.ca" city="Vancouver" provst="BC" country="Canada" month="5" day="28" year="2013">I have always loved this hymn too, I think I first heard it in 1970. It was maybe the first hymn I ever heard, as a child who grew up in a non-Christian home, but my grandparents were Christians. It is amazing how the words come to you when you need them, just as the Word of God does. So strengthening, and also to hear from others here who feel the same.</article>

And some glad day His sun shall shine in splendor
 When He the Savior, Savior of the world, is known."

Lovely hymn. I cannot wait for this time to come.</article>
	<article author="Dr. Nigel Lovell-Martin" email="" city="Miami" provst="Florida" country="United States" month="4" day="10" year="2012">I grew up in the Moravian Church in Guyana and first sang this graceful hymn during Lent thirty three years ago. I have loved it ever since because of its theological depth which addresses the nativity, passion, and the expectation of the second coming of Christ as King.This hymn embodies all that the Church teaches in the most excellent way.</article>
	<article author="Carlene Curtis" email="" city="Kingston" provst="" country="Jamaica" month="3" day="20" year="2012">:) I absolutely appreciate this graceful ancient hymn which I feel very deeply every instance that I sing it.

Love it!!!</article>
	<article author="Michael Petras" email="" city="Sydney" provst="New South Wales" country="Australia" month="4" day="30" year="2011">I knew an English-born popular women's speaker, Irene Young, who told me she was at the Keswick Convention when she believed this song was first sung. She said we returned from lunch one day and a sheet with Fullerton's new hymn was on our seats. Fullerton was a regular and popular Keswick speaker. It is, of course, one of those hymns written to a particular tune, Londonderry Air. It captures the breadth and scope of Christian theology and experience and when Irene died she wished it sung at her funeral.</article>
	<article author="Bertha" email="" city="Centurion" provst="Gauteng" country="South Africa" month="6" day="17" year="2010">I had a hectic week so far. Missing my deceased grandmother, my mother giving me stress and missing my ex boyfriend, and failing my exams and today this hymn came to my mind and the part that came to my mind was: but this I know He came to heal the broken hearted and I know that is true.</article>
	<article author="Becky" email="" city="Anacortes" provst="WA" country="United States" month="6" day="13" year="2010">I discovered this hymn many years ago, yet it never ceases to make me weep. I long for this day - when our King receives the worship and honor He deserves - "Earth to heaven and heaven to earth shall answer, at last, the Savior, Savior of the world is King!"</article>
	<article author="Rudolph" email="" city="Montego Bay" provst="St. James" country="Jamaica" month="4" day="23" year="2010">I learned this song in devotions at Ferncourt High School, St. Ann, Jamaica during the period 1975-1980. I love this song so much, I still remember it today.</article>
	<article author="Jim" email="" city="Doha" provst="" country="Qatar" month="3" day="12" year="2010">I sang this hymn for the 1st time this morning. It says it all - I don't know....BUT THIS I KNOW!</article>
	<article author="Kenny  Austin" email="" city="Dereham" provst="Norfolk" country="United Kingdom" month="11" day="21" year="2009">I stumbed across this website but I would like to add a comment. There is so much confusion and uncertainty in this world today but this hymn, set to this tune, Londonderry Air, so reminds me that God is my Rock, my Fortress and my Deliverer. It so strengthens me so that often tears come flooding from my eyes. God bless you who read this.</article>
	<article author="Karin" email="" city="Modesto" provst="California" country="United States" month="10" day="28" year="2009">This hymn is one I first learned at Urbana in the late 70s. I have never forgotten it. The lyrics capture the life and purpose of Christ in a few stanzas, and the tune is classic.

I agree with Michelle--when everything is going wrong and it seems like things will never get better, hymns like these remind us who is really in control of history.</article>
	<article author="Michele" email="" city="" provst="" country="Jamaica" month="10" day="26" year="2009">I love this hymn. It's a shame that today's generation is not into hymns. This is my generation but these are the hymns/songs I grow up on - when I am going through the rough the words of this song and others are what I use to guide me out of that moment.</article>
