I have been looking for it and decided to see if this amazing iPad that was an 80th birthday gift for me, was all it was cracked up to be-------and lo and behold-- there it was AND the music playing loud and clear ( so many times the sound doesn't come thru when I try to play various things). I know The Lord had His hand on this!! Thank you Jimmy for the years of blessings of music - thru it all!! God bless.</article>
