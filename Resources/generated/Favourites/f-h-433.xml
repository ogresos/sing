I haven't heard this hymn in years.
It was my dear loving wife's dearest testimony and hymn.
She is the Lord's!!
It was placed upon her tombstone at the time of her passing after we were married for one year.
I cannot express the hope I have when I see her standing with the Lord.</article>

	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="11" day="17" year="2013">We sung this hymn at my daughter's wedding.
The tune for this beautiful hymn was written for the beautiful wedding hymn, "O Perfect Love", by Dorothy F. Gurney. This tune was written specifically for the wedding of Queen Victoria's granddaughter, Princess Louise of Wales.
----------------------
Below are the words of that wedding hymn:
1. O perfect Love, all human thought transcending,
 Lowly we kneel in prayer before Thy throne,
 That theirs may be the love which knows no ending,
 Whom Thou forevermore dost join in one.
----------------------------
2. O perfect Life, be Thou their full assurance,
 Of tender charity and steadfast faith,
 Of patient hope and quiet, brave endurance,
 With childlike trust that fears not pain nor death.
--------------------------
3. Grant them the joy which brightens earthly sorrow;
 Grant them the peace which calms all earthly strife,
 And to life’s day the glorious unknown morrow
 That dawns upon eternal love and life.
---------------------------
4. Hear us, O Father, gracious and forgiving,
 Through Jesus Christ, Thy coeternal Word,
 Who, with the Holy Ghost, by all things living
 Now and to endless ages art adored.</article>

I've loved Him since my teenage years and He is more precious now than ever.
A verse from this hymn was quoted on our calendar and I just had to look it up.
Thank you for this lovely rendering.</article>
