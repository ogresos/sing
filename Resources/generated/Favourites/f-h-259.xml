	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="5" day="31" year="2014">In the original, this song does not have a chorus. Instead each stanza ends with
Even me, even me,
&lt;repeat line that preceeds "Even me, even me"&gt;
For example, the last stanza ends:
Even me, even me,
Blessing others, O bless me.
-----------------------------
stanza 2 says "Let Thy mercy light on me" instead of "fall on me".
--------------------------------
stanza 3 ends with "O call me" instead of "call for me".
----------------------
stanza 4 is a little different:
Pass me not, O mighty Spirit!
 Thou canst make the blind to see;
 Witnesser of Jesus’ merit,
 Speak the Word of power to me;
 Even me, even me,
 Speak the Word of power to me.
----------------------------
There is an additional stanza following the 4th stanza:
Have I been in sin long sleeping,
 Long been slighting, grieving Thee?
 Has the world my heart been keeping?
 O forgive and rescue me;
 Even me, even me,
 O forgive and rescue me.
----------------------------------
Last stanza, line 1 says:
Pass me not; but pardon bringing</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="5" day="31" year="2014">Mrs. Codner was born in Dartmouth, England. She married an Anglican clergyman, Daniel Dodner, and for many years they were active in the Mildmay Protestant Mission [to the Jews] in the north end of London. This hymn was written in 1860 after some young people had returned from visiting Ireland and witnessed a spiritual awakening. She challenged these young people to not only witness but also experience the outpouring of the Spirit, "that some drops would fall on them". The following Lord's Day morning due to illness she remained at home and penned these lines. - Songs of the Spirit by Martin</article>
	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="5" day="31" year="2014">Elizabeth Codner's own words on how she wrote this hymn, in "The Revival", April 28, 1860:
"A party of young friends over whom I was watch­ing with anx­ious hope at­tend­ed a meet­ing in which de­tails were giv­en of a re­viv­al work in Ire­land. They came back great­ly im­pressed. My fear was lest their own fleece re­main dry, and I pressed up­on them the pri­vi­lege and re­spon­si­bil­i­ty of get­ting a share in the out­poured bless­ing. On the Sun­day fol­low­ing, not be­ing well enough to get out, I had a time of qui­et com­mun­ion. Those child­ren were still on my heart, and I longed to press up­on them an ear­nest in­di­vid­u­al ap­peal. Without ef­fort words seemed to be giv­en to me, and they took the form of a hymn,” which as it was passed from one to ano­ther of the young peo­ple, “be­came a word of pow­er.”</article>
