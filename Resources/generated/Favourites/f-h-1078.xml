	<article author="Marietta Alexander" email="eviejoy47@gmail.com" city="Everett" provst="Washington" country="United States" month="3" day="3" year="2015">Was reading in Mark 10 as Jesus approached Jericho, they came upon Bartimaeus, a blind man, who was begging along the road side. Then, I felt the Holy Spirit bring this song to my remembrance. I thought all the Billy Graham crusades where I had heard it sung. When Jesus comes powers of the evil one are broken. Jesus is our only hope in such a perverted world. He alone can set us free from sin.</article>

The message is clear to everyone and reminds us that our Lord Christ is the answer to all who turn to Him in faith, believing. Reading the Gospels - Matthew, Mark, Luke and John - the same answer is given 2000 years ago.</article>
	<article author="Tom Sorrells" email="adasorrells@aol.com" city="Dothan" provst="Alabama" country="United States" month="11" day="8" year="2013">I grew up in Atlanta, Georgia. My father was a bi-vocational minister of music and had an extensive choir program in some large churches. He loved this song.

	<article author="Melanie" email="medgar238@gmail.com" city="Stevenage" provst="" country="United Kingdom" month="9" day="26" year="2013">I am going through a period of change and growth. This morning's bible devotion was entitled When Jesus comes and I immediately thought of this song. We only used to sing the chorus of this song when I was a child. I carried this song with me today and soothed the rawness of the "washing machine drum" of emotions I've been experiencing. The song ministered to me and gave me peace. "He takes the gloom and fills the life with glory." Amen</article>
	<article author="Elsa Castillo" email="wood_vibe@hotmail.com" city="George Town" provst="Grand Cayman" country="Cayman Islands" month="9" day="25" year="2013">I cannot recall how many times I sat and listen to my father sing this hymn to me and my husband and each time he sang it, it became more special. For my husband this was one of the few sweet memories that he has of my father as he passed away last year around this time. He died of Alheizmers and I remember as he was in the early stages he would continually sing this hymn when we would ask him and he would forget some of the words but sing it anyway. Very special hymn and will remain with us for our life-time!</article>

There is a triumphant solution. I have this translated into Japanese. Now I'm looking for sheet music to learn to sing this to anyone who needs an answer to their doubts with a touch and an "I will!"</article>
