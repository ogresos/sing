The writer presents clearly:
1. The assurance of our standing—on the only reliable/ dependable foundation.
2. The assurance of our progress in our walk as we go through life.
3. The assurance of us going right through to glory.
What blessed assurance "He is able to keep you [all believers] from falling and to present you [all believers] faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy"- Jude 24</article>
    <article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="MI" country="United States" month="2" day="9" year="2013">Most hymnals simply list the author of this hymn as "K" because he wanted to remain anonymous. The hymn was 1st published in 1787 in a hymnbook put together by John Rippon, a Baptist minister in London. While the author remained a mystery for a while, most musicologists now agree that John Rippon's assistant, Robert Keene, was probably the author.
The title of the hymn was "Scripture Promises," and in that 1787 hymnbook these words from 2 Peter 1:4 were printed above the 1st stanza: "Great and precious promises." Each stanza of the hymn emphasizes a different promise in God's Word, with the great climax coming on the last verse, "The soul that on Jesus still leans for repose ... I'll never, no, never, no, never forsake.!" - Great Songs of Faith by Brown &amp; Norton</article>

Great grace of our Lord, so sublime and so great;
There is no other love that can ever equate.
Though others may leave us, our lovers, our friends;
Thy love, O thy love Lord, thy love never ends.</article>

John15:1 and 6a
I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman...If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered...</article>
    <article author="Ebenezer" email="" city="Hyderabad" provst="" country="India" month="10" day="7" year="2008">It speaks about the assurance of salvation. Many think that salvation of a believer will be lost. I don't know how it can be lost when salvation is God's work, and how can man sustain it by his own works and not by God's grace!!</article>
