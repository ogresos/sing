	<article author="Steve Miller" email="steve@voiceinwilderness.info" city="Detroit" provst="Mi" country="United States" month="12" day="23" year="2013">This hymn was originally entitled "Redemption through the Precious Blood." It was inspired by Revelation 5:9: "And they sang a new song with these words: 'You are worthy... For you were slaughtered and your blood has ransomed people for God."
William Dix was an Anglican layman born in Bristol, England. He settled in Glasgow, Scotland, where he became a successful maritime insurance salesman. As a young man of 29, Dix was stricken by a serious illness and was confined to bed for some time. He suffered deep depression during this time, but through it all he met God in a very personal way. His spiritual experience led to the composition of this hymn and many others, [including "What child is this" to the tune of Greensleeves].
----------------------------
Stanza 1, line 5: "His redeemed ones" originally says "peaceful Zion".
-------------------
Stanza 3, line 1: "Bread of Heaven" was originally "bread of angels". This improvement is made in many hymnals.
--------------------
The 2nd 1/2 of stanza 3 is originally:
Intercessor, Friend of sinners, 
Earthâ€™s Redeemer, plead for me,
Where the songs of all the sinless 
sweep across the crystal sea.</article>
