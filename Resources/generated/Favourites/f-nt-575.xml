	<article author="Elaine Taylor" email="" city="" provst="" country="Canada" month="11" day="10" year="2013">The words were written by H.L.R. Deck. My old sheet music says "From F.C. Goudimel" and is also a different tune (C_DEF_E_DC_BC| E_FGA_G_FEDCD---| etc). Rich!</article>

I have gone through deep distresses for some time now. And the truths expressed in the hymn catches what is in my heart. I was singing just parts of two stanzas... Then I searched the net and found your site. Thanks for your ministry.</article>
	<article author="Arne Teigland" email="" city="Moorhead" provst="Minnesota" country="United States" month="6" day="14" year="2012">I love this hymn too. A friend sang it at our wedding 43 years ago, and I have turned to it often. The tune used here is different from the one I know from the old IVCF "Hymns". But this also has a stanza (#2) that "Hymns" doesn't include. I'm grateful to have found this site. Can anyone tell me the background to this song?</article>
	<article author="Henna" email="" city="Pleasanton" provst="CA" country="United States" month="8" day="19" year="2010">I really enjoy verse 4 because it reminds us that we always need the Lord. It's easy to forget Him on the days that we "don't need" Him; when we are happy and our lives are going well. However, these are the days we need to most remember to draw near to the Lord!</article>

	<article author="Chay Dionco" email="" city="Quezon City" provst="" country="Philippines" month="3" day="22" year="2008">This hymn encourages me to just pursue the Lord and hold on to His Word no matter what the situation is in our christian life and in our church life. All else will fail but His promise, His Word will remain. Praise the Lord!</article>
