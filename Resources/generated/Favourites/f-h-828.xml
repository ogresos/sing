She established a home called Friedenshort (abode of peace) for women who desired to follow and serve the Lord. With these sisters, she opened homes for orphans, widows, the poor, and the infirm. By the end of her life, over 40 homes were set up around Germany through her labor. These sisters also preached the gospel to women in prison and established homes for them when they were discharged from prison. Although she was brought up in wealth, she lived a simple life using her wealth for the benefit of others. She eventually sent out a number of sisters to serve in China with the China Inland Mission, and to Guatemala, Africa, and India. She was helped in her spiritual pursuit through contact with Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis, Hudson Taylor, the Welsh Revival, and the Keswick Convention. Sister Eva enjoyed fellowship with all true believers. She would not let any sectarian attitude or doctrinal differences hinder her fellowship with other saints. This hymn describes the divisive conditions of the church and her longing to find believers who live in oneness, not letting doctrines and practices divide them. It is a sober reminder to us that our divine birth is a common birth and that Christ's death has torn down all that divides believers. - Songs of the Spirit by Martin</article>
