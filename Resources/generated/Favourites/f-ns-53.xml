You did Your part and Your blessing and love for me is pouring. Nothing has changed but me. Lord help me to do things right and pleasing for You. Even many years passed by You're still knocking in my heart. No matter where success brought me I feel the emptiness and it's You who only fills my heart. Lead me Lord to the deal I've promised You. You're my God forever and for eternity. Pray for me, my God.</article>

	<article author="Cheryl Carlson" email="" city="Athens" provst="GA" country="" month="1" day="2" year="2010">Reading Liam's comment reminded me of a young Christian friend that is on Facebook. This is his most recent post: "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness. Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me. 10 That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong." ~ 2 Corinthians 12:9-10</article>

	<article author="Rensis Go" email="" city="Baguio City" provst="" country="Philippines" month="1" day="18" year="2003">I enjoyed singing this song when everything seems to be at the dead end. I realize that there is a God who placed me in such a "dead end", not to punish me or to make me suffer, but rather to show me that "God is there for me tomorrow, as He is for me today..." Today, He is here to dispense His riches into me more than ever to make me a little bit more gold, more silver, and more a precious stone. He's truly our God, and He's making us the same as He is in life and in nature to become that bride descending from the heavens-THE NEW JERUSALEM. Let's love Him today!</article>
	<article author="Zoe Cabahug" email="" city="Greensboro" provst="NC" country="U.S.A." month="11" day="4" year="2002">This song speaks to me very deeply.

God will be with us always.</article>
	<article author="Janet Chang" email="" city="" provst="" country="Singapore" month="11" day="1" year="2002">Well, this song makes me realize every time that only God can be there for me, wherever I may be, whatever I may be doing! He's all I need!

Do you know why I like this hymn, brothers and sisters? I remember there's one time when I was feeling very down, empty and I was too stubborn and refuse to turn to the Lord no matter what! I felt my love for Him wasn't that strong instead was for other things. But thank God, when I went for the youth mtg, they were singing this hymn.

And praise the Lord, He brought me through that period of time! And now I know only He is there for me always. He is always there to take all our sorrows away when we would just turn to Him! Who can be there for us when we are in school, when we are in the toilet, when we are feeling down? NO ONE but GOD!

Now when I look back, I felt I was really stupid to love something which will soon pass away, which will not give me comfort and rest,who does not even love me that much and give up someone who is always there for me, who love me till the uttermost!

So saints, remember who can be there always to take all your sorrows away? - no one but God! Treasure your everyday with Him and LOVE HIM for He is so precious to us.......</article>
