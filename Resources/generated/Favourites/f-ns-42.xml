	<article author="Charles" email="" city="" provst="" country="Canada" month="6" day="25" year="2011">Today I was quite touched by this hymn. To me, it seems like a life-long journey with the Lord. In verse one, a teenager comes to the Lord for the first time, hoping that she will "always" love the Lord. In verse 2, she is living independently for the first time, and now has a "choice" between the Lord and the world, but "still" chooses the Lord. In verse 3, she meets obstacles in her Christian life. "The way is hard." But she still relies on the Lord. In verse 4, she has hit a plateau, and needs the Lord to "lead" him "everyday." Finally, in verse 5, as an old person, after many "years" and "things," she still is committed to the Lord, loving Him. The chorus shows that throughout her entire life, the person's love for the Lord kept on growing. It wasn't just a difference between the beginning and the end. It's a daily, small, incremental growth. This hymn resembles a love story between an aging couple, and shows that the Lord should be a person to us, someone with whom we have a intimate, loving relationship, from youth until old age.</article>
