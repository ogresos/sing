Through hardship our gold may be refined and our relationship with Christ deepened. That which the devil intends to use to frustrate or discourage us becomes the very means by which God draws us more closely to Himself and prepares us for an eternal life with Him. Thank You Jesus for Your presence that never leaves nor forsakes and Your promise to work all things for our good!</article>
    <article author="Rosita Enriquez" email="" city="Anaheim" provst="CA" country="United States" month="9" day="24" year="2011">It is true dear saints, when we go through trials, as sister M.E. Barber put it;
 
"But this one thing I know:
The Lord will still grow dearer,
 And fellowship will be
The closer and the sweeter
 Between my Lord and me."

Our brother Watchman Nee said that hundreds and thousands of conversations between The Lord and you will happen when we go through a way that we do not know. O The Lord will become sweeter through these.

1 Peter 5:5b to 12 is wonderful for times of trials. 
The footnote 2 of 5:12, of the Recovery version, says: 
"That they may pass through those sufferings, God supplies them with all the multiplied, varied, and true grace (v.10, 1:2; 4:10), which is sufficient to enable them to participate in the sufferings of and for Christ....)"

We do not know when we will meet Him, but as our sister encouraged us, perchance (possibly), He will be there hidden just beyond the bend or at the turn, the curve. Let's enter INTO this Grace.</article>
