    <article author="Marialevi" email="jimlevlay@yahoo.com" city="" provst="California" country="United States" month="3" day="19" year="2013">Praise the Lord for such a blending and cooperation between God and man--Working together in sweet mingling and joint dependence, so that God could labor alone no more and that we ourselves serve no longer individually but corporately with Christ and His Body! What a principle of incarnation this is!
 
We praise and thank You, dear Lord for Your eternal plan, and for creating us to become Your expression so that we could possess Your very life. You are our inheritance and we become Your possession. How we desire You to be expressed through us and in us even more now!</article>
