But hallelujah that our dear LORD is the LIVING LIGHT!! Oh, I tell you when I turn my heart to the lord the veil is removed right away I see thy light. Dear brothers and sisters the Lord is so precious.</article>
	<article author="Joan" email="" city="Pampanga" provst="" country="" month="11" day="13" year="2007">I just like this song simply because a lot of things in my life that I want to pursue. My environment agreed with it but the Lord Jesus Himself does not want it for me. He has an sovereign arrangement to change this environment which I would like to possess. He removes all the things just to see His light esp. the needs for His building...Saints your burden must be the burden of our Lord Jesus...Remove all the things that are not for His buildung...Pursue things that satisfy His Heart...Amen.</article>
